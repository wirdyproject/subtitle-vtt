I'm Paris.

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:37.292
Hello, Paris.

56
00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:38.583
But I'm not married yet.

57
00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:43.042
So, what should be written there
is "Miss Paris".

58
00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:44.625
Not "Mrs. Paris".

59
00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:46.792
Yes... Sorry, Miss.

How long will you stay in Bali?

70
00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:35.042
I've paid for the car and the driver
for one week.

71
00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:39.125
If I need them longer,
I will pay again.

That's not what I meant.

Are you in Bali for vacation or...

74
00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:48.667
Do I have to tell you
why I go to Bali?

75
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.042
[Paris] Just ask the foreigners there.

76
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:54.958
Why I come here
is none of your business.

77
00:04:55.042 --> 00:04:57.458
Your business is to take me to places.

Since you were born in Bali.

Oh.

Back then...

256
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.597
my mother had a dream
of raising her child in Paris.

257
00:16:18.014 --> 00:16:21.389
That's why my mother gave me
the name Paris.

258
00:16:21.472 --> 00:16:25.097
Because to her,
I was one of her dreams that came true.

But unfortunately,
not all of her dreams came true.

That's why I return to Bali.

And you coming back here...

262
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.722
is that what you want?

I...

264
00:16:56.889 --> 00:16:59.597
always learn...

265
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.847
that expectations will end
in disappointments.

266
00:17:07.514 --> 00:17:09.055
So, as much as possible...

267
00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:14.958
I believe in what is best for me.

268
00:17:16.555 --> 00:17:19.305
So, if you ask whether...

269
00:17:19.389 --> 00:17:24.097
this is exactly what I imagined
before I came here...

270
00:17:25.139 --> 00:17:26.389
the answer is...

271
00:17:28.722 --> 00:17:30.180
Well...

272
00:17:31.597 --> 00:17:35.014
This is more than I imagined.

273
00:17:35.097 --> 00:17:36.722

I was picked up by a guy...

00:17:43.764 --> 00:17:46.597
who I thought was a driver...

and what people think,
when he brought my stuff...

279
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.472
that he was my boyfriend.

280
00:17:51.555 --> 00:17:53.430
But...

281
00:17:53.514 --> 00:17:56.055
it turns out the plot twist is...

Don't ever give up.
We must remain enthusiastic as a youngster.

I'll be waiting for you, okay?

364
00:22:40.472 --> 00:22:41.639
Okay.

365
00:22:44.805 --> 00:22:46.433

Thank you for today.

I miss you too, my darling.

what you were looking for?

before you left for Bali.</i>

Are you sure you want to do this?

I'm sure.

383
00:23:40.347 --> 00:23:43.430
I'll never regret my decision
to come to Bali.

[Paris] <i>And I'm also sure...</i>

that I can find
what I'm looking for.

When people are trying to relax, there
could only be two problems in their lives.

First...

388
00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.805
money problem.

389
00:23:58.889 --> 00:23:59.972
And the second?

390
00:24:00.055 --> 00:24:01.514
Calm down.

391
00:24:02.639 --> 00:24:04.180
Woman problem.

392
00:24:04.264 --> 00:24:05.347
I'm sure about that.

393
00:24:08.805 --> 00:24:10.139
Hey, Bro.

394
00:24:10.222 --> 00:24:11.722
- Bro.
- [Bumi] Huh?

395
00:24:11.805 --> 00:24:13.680
[Sadewo] Listen to me first.

396
00:24:13.764 --> 00:24:14.930
You're crazy, aren't you?

397
00:24:15.014 --> 00:24:16.639
Can't you see how stressed I am?

398
00:24:17.847 --> 00:24:20.264
That woman really ruined my life.

399
00:24:21.764 --> 00:24:23.264
Destroyed my pride.

400
00:24:24.472 --> 00:24:28.013
Not only my pride as a husband,
but my pride as a man!

401
00:24:28.847 --> 00:24:30.389
I'm done.

402
00:24:30.472 --> 00:24:33.014
- How come?
- I don't know.

403
00:24:33.097 --> 00:24:34.930
Oh, dear...

404
00:24:35.014 --> 00:24:37.972
You shouldn't accept that, Sir Bro.
In my opinion, you should fight.

405
00:24:38.055 --> 00:24:41.430
- You can't just do nothing.
- Do you think I didn't do all that?

406
00:24:41.514 --> 00:24:42.847
[Sadewo] Ouch!

407
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.075
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- [Sadewo's wife] You want to fight?

408

Have you forgotten
that I know all your secrets?

409
00:24:53.555 --> 00:24:55.764
Or do you want to go to jail?

410
00:24:55.848 --> 00:24:57.181
Is that so?

411
00:24:58.722 --> 00:25:02.180
Looking at your appearance,
about money...

412
00:25:02.264 --> 00:25:04.389
I'm sure
you have no problem with that.

413

- [Sadewo] Oh, right.
- Let me.

- You have money?
- I have.

416

Calm down.

417

- [waitress] Thank You.

who has money but acts like a homeless?

So, what's the problem?

423
00:25:32.014 --> 00:25:33.180
You're just not neat.

424

I can't be neat.

Sometimes people think,
"Okay, my appearance is okay enough."

427

Well, that can't be allowed, Sir Bro.

neat once in a while.

- To do what?
- I'll make you presentable.

- We'll eat later.
- Where else will we go?

All good!

I'm serious, Sir Bro.

If you don't have a girlfriend,
you won't be able to be my teacher.

I'm serious, Sir Bro.
Why won't you believe me?

Bring your girl here.

Introduce her to me.

496
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.764
Don't act as if you're low profile.

I never think with this,
but with this.

Sir Bro, that's normal.

509
00:29:51.305 --> 00:29:53.930
All men think with this first,
and with this afterward.

510
00:29:54.014 --> 00:29:55.055
Okay.

511
00:29:56.097 --> 00:29:58.097
That's normal.

512

But you know, right?

513
00:29:59.972 --> 00:30:01.555
My life is done.

514
00:30:02.889 --> 00:30:04.472
You know...

515
00:30:04.555 --> 00:30:07.055
your wife is a successful woman.

00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:08.597
Successful?

517
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.264
Hey, listen to me.

518
00:30:11.514 --> 00:30:14.847
If she's successful,
I wouldn't be done like this.

519
00:30:16.042 --> 00:30:18.333

Here's the thing, Sir Bro.

522
00:30:21.792 --> 00:30:24.251
There is a proverb.

523
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:28.708
A successful man...

524
00:30:28.792 --> 00:30:33.013
is a man who can get more income...

525
00:30:33.097 --> 00:30:35.946
than what his wife spends.

526
00:30:36.042 --> 00:30:38.042
And a successful woman...

527
00:30:38.125 --> 00:30:42.000
is a woman who can get a man like you.

528
00:30:42.097 --> 00:30:43.930
- Is that so?
- Yes!

[giggling]

530
00:30:46.555 --> 00:30:51.555
The proof is that now you can still support
your family. You can still live well.

531
00:30:53.597 --> 00:30:55.097
- Sir Bro.
- Yes.

532
00:30:58.347 --> 00:31:00.055
There's a story, Sir Bro.

533
00:31:01.722 --> 00:31:03.389
There is an area...

534
00:31:03.472 --> 00:31:06.139
which has a very deep well.

535
00:31:07.639 --> 00:31:11.639
[Bumi] And in this well,
scary jinns await.

536
00:31:13.097 --> 00:31:14.305
And over there...

537
00:31:15.685 --> 00:31:17.935
there are only two living creatures.

538
00:31:18.019 --> 00:31:19.561
A married couple.

539
00:31:22.063 --> 00:31:24.805
When her husband wants to be free...

540
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:28.110
he brings his wife
towards the well...

541
00:31:28.208 --> 00:31:30.749
and he throws her into the well.

542
00:31:32.225 --> 00:31:34.433
- Imagine...
- And then?

543
00:31:34.517 --> 00:31:37.101
how bad that man wants to be free.

544
00:31:39.343 --> 00:31:41.135
But what happens afterward, Sir Bro?

545
00:31:41.219 --> 00:31:44.415
Five minutes later,
all the jinns run away.

546
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.125
Scared of the wife.

547
00:31:46.209 --> 00:31:47.530
Wait.

Let's have another toast then.

Well, that's what he said.

What kind of wife
do you think you will be?

560
00:32:23.972 --> 00:32:25.722
It depends.

561
00:32:26.805 --> 00:32:27.972
Depends on her husband.

562
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.472
Good point.

00:32:33.722 --> 00:32:34.889
What about you?

What kind of woman are you looking for?

565
00:32:40.014 --> 00:32:42.597
A woman...

566
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.889
that if her husband dies,
she will never remarry.

567
00:32:49.889 --> 00:32:51.014
What about you?

568

A husband who will never leave
his family.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:29.749
[Sadewo] Oh, this is
Bumi when he was little.

677
00:39:29.833 --> 00:39:30.875
Yes.

678
00:39:32.458 --> 00:39:34.875
Bumi often talks about you.

679
00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:37.055
But he never talked about his father.

680
00:39:39.083 --> 00:39:40.791
[Sadewo] Where is his father now?

681
00:39:44.264 --> 00:39:45.805
His father...

682
00:39:48.514 --> 00:39:52.014
We never know what happened to him.

683
00:39:57.397 --> 00:40:00.564
[Rahmi] That's why Bumi...

684
00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:02.648
hates his birthday.

685
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.958
I never knew what happened to my husband.

686
00:40:07.042 --> 00:40:08.667
[Rahmi] Only God knows...

687
00:40:10.972 --> 00:40:13.264
what happened to...

688
00:40:15.889 --> 00:40:17.472
Bumi's father.

689
00:40:19.656 --> 00:40:21.615
I'm sorry to hear that.

690
00:40:22.597 --> 00:40:23.722
[Rahmi] Thank you.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:40.055
[Rahmi] Hey.

694
00:40:40.139 --> 00:40:41.389
[Rahmi] Who is he?

695
00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:43.597
- My friend.
- [Rahmi] Who is he?

696
00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.608
[Bumi] Sir Bro.

697
00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.881
[grunting]

698
00:40:59.042 --> 00:41:00.333
Who is he?

699
00:41:02.732 --> 00:41:03.791
Sir Bro...

[grunting]

701
00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:07.930
Sir.

702
00:41:09.305 --> 00:41:10.597
Sir.

703
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.471
[Sadewo] Gosh, Ma'am. Do you need to sit?

704
00:41:12.555 --> 00:41:14.058
[laughing]

705
00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:15.430
Sorry, Ma'am.

706
00:41:15.667 --> 00:41:17.166
Sir Bro, did you get kicked out?

707
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:18.417
You don't know that.

708
00:41:19.606 --> 00:41:22.106
Sorry, Ma'am. I fell asleep.

709
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.732
Can I borrow Bumi for a while?

710
00:41:25.076 --> 00:41:26.742
I'll bring him back home. Promise.

711
00:41:28.222 --> 00:41:29.472
It won't be long, Mom.

712
00:41:29.555 --> 00:41:30.764
It'll be quick.

713
00:41:34.597 --> 00:41:36.055
I need to change my shirt.

714
00:41:36.139 --> 00:41:37.583
In my room.

715
00:41:37.667 --> 00:41:38.834
Over there.

716
00:41:41.097 --> 00:41:42.347
Borrow?

717
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:43.805
Just a moment.

718
00:41:43.889 --> 00:41:45.805
Who is that, anyway?

719
00:41:45.889 --> 00:41:46.930
Who?

720
00:41:47.014 --> 00:41:52.890

[clinking glasses]

722
00:41:57.667 --> 00:41:59.375
[Sadewo] This is a photo of my child.

723
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:01.555
[Sadewo] Beautiful, huh?

724
00:42:02.667 --> 00:42:04.667
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful?

725
00:42:04.958 --> 00:42:06.250
Very beautiful.

726
00:42:08.264 --> 00:42:11.805
When she was five years old,
her mother took her abroad.

727
00:42:13.935 --> 00:42:17.726
And since then, I haven't known how...

728
00:42:18.972 --> 00:42:21.055
How to contact her.

729
00:42:21.136 --> 00:42:26.599
[electro house music]

730
00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.055
[Sadewo] Well...

731
00:42:29.792 --> 00:42:32.333
[Sadewo] It was fifteen years ago.

732
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:33.889
I never move.

733
00:42:35.139 --> 00:42:37.874
I never change my address.

734
00:42:37.958 --> 00:42:39.166
Know why?

735
00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.891
My hope is that one day,
my child will come and look for me.

736
00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.097
And that the woman I love
will someday look for me too.

737
00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:58.808
[electro house music]

738
00:42:58.889 --> 00:43:00.180
It will happen, Sir Bro.

739
00:43:00.264 --> 00:43:03.222
[electro house music]

740
00:43:03.305 --> 00:43:04.773
[Sadewo] I know...

741
00:43:05.847 --> 00:43:07.847
fifteen years ago
I was too selfish.

742
00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:10.472
[Sadewo] Pursuing my ambitions.

743
00:43:10.555 --> 00:43:12.722
My wife only asked for one thing
at that time.

744
00:43:12.805 --> 00:43:14.555
"Do you have time?"

745
00:43:14.639 --> 00:43:16.889
"Just pay a little attention to us."

746
00:43:16.972 --> 00:43:19.558
[electro house music]

747
00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:21.555
I didn't do it.

748
00:43:21.639 --> 00:43:24.055
I didn't pay attention,
let alone have time.

749
00:43:24.139 --> 00:43:27.224
[electro house music]

750
00:43:27.305 --> 00:43:28.665
[Sadewo] Until finally she said...

751
00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.916
"What are you going to choose?"

752
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.750
Ambition is indeed a choice.

753
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:35.930
[Sadewo] Yes.

754
00:43:37.222 --> 00:43:38.222
[Sadewo] Enough already.

755
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.014
Here.

756
00:43:41.097 --> 00:43:42.972
Enough of my sad story.

757
00:43:43.055 --> 00:43:44.889
Your turn, tell me a story.

758
00:43:44.972 --> 00:43:46.930
I've been telling you my sad story.

759
00:43:48.167 --> 00:43:49.760
Listen.

760
00:43:49.844 --> 00:43:51.583
You've made me happy.

761
00:43:51.667 --> 00:43:54.083
Now it's my turn to make you happy.

762
00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.014
Invite your girl here.

763
00:43:56.097 --> 00:43:57.972
Introduce her to me.

764
00:43:58.055 --> 00:43:59.264
I'll treat you.

765
00:44:00.597 --> 00:44:01.889
Okay?

766
00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:03.055
Thank you, Sir Bro.

[Paris] Why are you here?

769
00:44:09.764 --> 00:44:11.972
I miss your stupid face.

770
00:44:12.055 --> 00:44:13.055
Seriously?

771
00:44:13.139 --> 00:44:14.865
I have somewhere to go.
Do you want to accompany me?

772
00:44:14.889 --> 00:44:15.972
Why me?

773
00:44:17.514 --> 00:44:20.389
Because my friend asked me
to bring my girlfriend.

774
00:44:20.472 --> 00:44:22.972
But the only girl I'm close to is you.

775
00:44:23.055 --> 00:44:25.097
So, well...

776
00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.758
be my pretend girlfriend.

777
00:44:27.597 --> 00:44:30.139
Please. Come on. Okay?

778
00:44:30.222 --> 00:44:31.722
[Bumi] No need to be proud. Come on.

779
00:44:31.805 --> 00:44:33.805
Come on. That's okay. Come on.

[Bumi] Do you know...

789
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.211
why there's only a few stars tonight?

790

Don't know?

791
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.891
That's because
you are beautiful tonight.

792

So, all the stars are in your eyes.

is because I'm an adult.

left us instead?

847
00:49:03.708 --> 00:49:05.333
I have the right, Dad.

848
00:49:07.347 --> 00:49:10.244
I have the right to have a life...

849
00:49:10.328 --> 00:49:14.597
and grow up with a father's love.

850
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.264
[Paris] But why were my rights taken away?

851
00:49:17.526 --> 00:49:19.026
[Paris] We're the same, Dad.

852
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:23.972
We both live in regret.

853
00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:27.462
[Paris] My regret is...

854
00:49:27.546 --> 00:49:30.249
why when I first rode a bicycle...

855
00:49:30.333 --> 00:49:32.958
when I first went to school...

856
00:49:33.046 --> 00:49:37.095
the first time
I liked a guy...

857
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.347
At those times I had no father...

858
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:43.597
to look after me, to protect me.

859
00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.430
Or even to scold me when I'm wrong.

860
00:49:46.514 --> 00:49:49.222
You were not there!
You were never around!

861
00:49:49.305 --> 00:49:53.555
[slow music]

862
00:49:53.639 --> 00:49:54.805
Dad...

863
00:49:54.889 --> 00:49:58.472
[slow music]

864
00:49:58.555 --> 00:49:59.930
Maybe you're right.

865
00:50:02.014 --> 00:50:03.597
My coming here...

866
00:50:05.014 --> 00:50:07.264
Maybe it's because
God has forgiven you.

867
00:50:08.632 --> 00:50:10.264
Because I'm your daughter.

868
00:50:10.347 --> 00:50:15.555
[slow music]

869
00:50:15.639 --> 00:50:18.930
But I don't have any power at all
to forgive you.

870
00:50:20.972 --> 00:50:23.222
[Paris] I can only love you...

871
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:26.264
and get the answer to this question.

872
00:50:30.055 --> 00:50:33.097
After all this time
we've been apart...

873
00:50:36.639 --> 00:50:38.430
do you still love me?

874
00:50:38.514 --> 00:50:40.898
Ssh... Don't say that, kid.

875
00:50:42.875 --> 00:50:45.042
Listen, kid.

876
00:50:46.972 --> 00:50:48.875
I still love you.

877
00:50:50.375 --> 00:50:51.889
I still love you.

878
00:50:51.972 --> 00:50:59.972
[slow music]

879
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.495
[grunting]

880
00:51:09.504 --> 00:51:11.493
[Rahmi] Bumi. Let's eat.

881
00:51:11.574 --> 00:51:14.667
Okay, mom. Wait a minute.

882
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:22.958
[melodramatic music]

883
00:51:23.042 --> 00:51:30.458
[melodramatic music]

884
00:51:30.542 --> 00:51:33.500
[melodramatic music]

885
00:51:33.597 --> 00:51:34.597
Dad.

886
00:51:34.667 --> 00:51:42.083
[melodramatic music]

887
00:51:42.167 --> 00:51:49.583

[melodramatic music]

890
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:26.667
[Bumi] Sir Bro.

891
00:52:27.792 --> 00:52:28.917
How are you?

892
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.584
You planned everything, didn't you?

893
00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:37.585
How did you know
that Paris is my child?

894
00:52:42.514 --> 00:52:43.722
Well...

895
00:52:43.805 --> 00:52:46.097
That was when I realized that...

896
00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.472
Paris came here
to look for his father.

897
00:52:49.625 --> 00:52:51.708
And I just found out
that it turns out...

898
00:52:51.792 --> 00:52:53.709
that you're her father.

899
00:52:54.602 --> 00:53:02.602
[phone ringing]

900
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:10.750
[phone ringing]

901
00:53:10.875 --> 00:53:14.833
So, I was looking for the right time
to bring you and Paris together.

902
00:53:18.089 --> 00:53:19.839
How far is your relationship?

903
00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:23.090
Well, I haven't known
her for long, Sir Bro.

904
00:53:23.174 --> 00:53:24.632
- But...
- But what?

905
00:53:26.076 --> 00:53:27.242
But what?

906
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.443
[Sadewo] But you haven't known each other
for long?

907
00:53:30.467 --> 00:53:31.842
Good, then.

908
00:53:31.995 --> 00:53:34.276
That means it's easy for you
to stay away from each other.

909
00:53:37.812 --> 00:53:39.412
Why should we stay away from each other?

910
00:53:40.055 --> 00:53:41.180
You're asking me?

911
00:53:41.264 --> 00:53:42.389
Asking me why?

912
00:53:43.514 --> 00:53:45.805
All of our fun moments together...

913
00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:49.305
That's not what I expect
from my future child's partner.

914
00:53:49.389 --> 00:53:51.055
I'm a man.

915
00:53:51.139 --> 00:53:54.416
And every time I look in the mirror,
it's as if I'm talking to myself.

916
00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.083
I don't want...

917
00:53:56.156 --> 00:53:58.156
my child's partner
will be like me.

918
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:02.430
Sorry.

919
00:54:03.708 --> 00:54:07.139
I'm not you,
if that's what you mean.

920
00:54:08.389 --> 00:54:12.459
What if it was the universe
that united me with Paris?

921
00:54:13.143 --> 00:54:14.768
Enough.

922
00:54:15.141 --> 00:54:16.558
I don't need your excuse.

923
00:54:17.347 --> 00:54:19.889
The most important thing for me now
is to make Paris happy...

924
00:54:19.972 --> 00:54:22.097
after 17 years of my life
full of regrets.

925
00:54:24.222 --> 00:54:25.430
Stay away from Paris.

926
00:54:26.972 --> 00:54:28.097
Okay?

927
00:54:30.639 --> 00:54:31.889
You pay for my coffee.

928
00:54:33.014 --> 00:54:34.180
[Sadewo] My cell phone.

- Alright.

00:55:39.555 --> 00:55:40.974

[door knocking]

00:56:17.472 --> 00:56:18.472
[Rahmi] Yes.

[door creaking]

949
00:56:24.167 --> 00:56:25.375
[Rahmi] Paris?

950
00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:29.500
[Rahmi] How strange.

951
00:56:30.472 --> 00:56:34.883
Is there something urgent
that makes you look for Bumi?

952
00:56:34.967 --> 00:56:38.972
Bumi doesn't make another mistake,
like when he took your suitcase, right?

953
00:56:39.055 --> 00:56:41.416
No. Absolutely not.

954
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.167
Bumi helped me...

955
00:56:44.264 --> 00:56:46.889
find someone
who had been apart from me.

956
00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:57.847
This is a photo of me
when I was little.

957
00:56:57.930 --> 00:56:59.805
[Paris] This is my mother, and...

958
00:56:59.889 --> 00:57:04.083
my father who left us for 17 years.

959
00:57:04.167 --> 00:57:07.583
[Paris] Thanks to Bumi,
I was able to find my father faster.

960
00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.972
[Paris] Before, I only had this photo
to get to know my father.

[footsteps approaching]

966
00:57:34.389 --> 00:57:35.389
Dad.

967
00:57:35.472 --> 00:57:36.472
Hey.

968
00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:38.472
[grunting]

969
00:57:38.667 --> 00:57:39.792
[Sadewo] Sit down, Kid.

970
00:57:44.708 --> 00:57:47.541
I couldn't wait for us to meet.

971
00:57:47.623 --> 00:57:48.789
I miss you.

972
00:57:49.859 --> 00:57:50.943
Have you eaten?

973
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:53.617
Miss.

974
00:57:53.701 --> 00:57:55.624
Spaghetti aglio olio.

975
00:57:55.708 --> 00:57:57.042
I still remember.

976
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.930
One spaghetti aglio olio,
one beef carbonara.

977
00:58:01.014 --> 00:58:02.472
[waitress] Okay. Please wait.

978
00:58:04.375 --> 00:58:05.964
Dad.

979
00:58:06.042 --> 00:58:08.875
- What?
- Have you heard from Bumi today?

980
00:58:13.531 --> 00:58:14.698
Actually, Kid...

981
00:58:14.904 --> 00:58:17.514
there's so much
I want to talk about with you.

982
00:58:17.753 --> 00:58:19.336
One of which is...

983
00:58:20.805 --> 00:58:23.305
I want us to be together again.

984
00:58:23.389 --> 00:58:24.764
Me...

985
00:58:24.847 --> 00:58:26.060
You...

986
00:58:26.125 --> 00:58:27.291
and your mother.

987
00:58:31.014 --> 00:58:32.305
Regarding Bumi...

988
00:58:34.542 --> 00:58:36.708
I want you to stay away from him.

989
00:58:36.781 --> 00:58:38.531
Why should I stay away from him?

990
00:58:39.538 --> 00:58:41.247
Dad.

991
00:58:41.331 --> 00:58:43.789
If it weren't for him,
I might have given up.

992
00:58:45.083 --> 00:58:46.833
I might have gone back to Paris.

993
00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:49.347
Forgetting the reason I came here.

994
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:51.722
I also feel the same way.

995
00:58:51.805 --> 00:58:55.305
Bumi is kind, smart, handsome, polite,
just got a bachelor's degree.

996
00:58:55.389 --> 00:58:56.847
But nothing more than that.

997
00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:58.291
Why, Dad?

998
00:58:58.375 --> 00:59:00.167
Because he is not a good man for you.

999
00:59:05.818 --> 00:59:08.901
So, this is why
Bumi isn't picking up my calls?

1000
00:59:10.276 --> 00:59:12.859
One day your feelings can change, too.

1001
00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:15.305
I'm sure of it.

1002
00:59:18.312 --> 00:59:20.437
Can your feelings towards Mom change?

1003
00:59:23.375 --> 00:59:24.792
You're wrong!

1004
00:59:24.889 --> 00:59:27.055
[Paris] You're so wrong!

1005
00:59:27.139 --> 00:59:28.805
[Paris] Imagine.

1006
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:30.791
When you choose a wife...

1007
00:59:30.875 --> 00:59:34.625
do you want your wife to remarry
when you die?

1008
00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:38.972
You never gave me a good example.

1009
00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:42.187
[Paris] How is that possible, Dad?
We have just met.

1010
00:59:42.271 --> 00:59:45.104
But you ask me to forget someone
who's already in my heart?

1011
00:59:46.347 --> 00:59:49.389
[Paris] Why are you so quick
to judge others?

1012
00:59:49.472 --> 00:59:53.555
Meanwhile, you needed that much time
to realize your own mistakes.

1013
00:59:55.216 --> 00:59:57.803
[Paris] It's enough
that you break Mom's heart.

1014
00:59:58.805 --> 01:00:01.428
Let me make my own choice, Dad.

1015
01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:06.732
Do you remember
why my name is Paris?

1016
01:00:09.542 --> 01:00:12.667
Because Mom only has me.

1017
01:00:12.765 --> 01:00:16.057
Mom can't have a man she loves.

1018
01:00:17.475 --> 01:00:19.597
Do you want that to happen to me too?

1019
01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.805
Paris.

1020
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:23.597
[Sadewo] Sit down, Child.

1021
01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.889
[Sadewo] Sit down, darling.

1022
01:00:27.167 --> 01:00:28.667
Listen to me.

1023
01:00:28.748 --> 01:00:31.484
How could he teach me
if he didn't have experience?

1024
01:00:31.568 --> 01:00:36.014
I changed, I had a stance.
My life was changed because of him.

1025
01:00:36.097 --> 01:00:38.639
But I feel like
he's not the right man for you.

1026
01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:40.333
No.

1027
01:00:40.437 --> 01:00:41.521
No.

1028
01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.055
I hate you!

1029
01:00:44.139 --> 01:00:46.305
Forget him, Paris.

1030
01:00:46.389 --> 01:00:47.597
Paris.

1031
01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:55.680
[melodramatic music]

1032
01:00:57.139 --> 01:00:58.680
- [waitress] Please.
- Thank you.

1033
01:01:01.097 --> 01:01:09.097
[melodramatic music]

1034
01:01:13.014 --> 01:01:14.698
[Paris] What did you talk about
with my dad?

1035
01:01:14.722 --> 01:01:17.433
[music]

1036
01:01:17.514 --> 01:01:19.756
[Bumi] What your father said is true.

1037
01:01:21.722 --> 01:01:23.222
Bumi.

1038
01:01:23.491 --> 01:01:25.866
I don't agree
with my father deciding my soul mate.

1039
01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:29.875
[Paris] I was surprised
when Dad forbade us to meet again.

1040
01:01:29.976 --> 01:01:33.685
And what surprised me most,
why did you do what he asked?

1041
01:01:38.889 --> 01:01:41.849
You think I don't know
your history with your father?

1042
01:01:41.933 --> 01:01:44.475
And you think my being here
is a coincidence?

1043
01:01:46.796 --> 01:01:48.213
I'm waiting for you, Paris.

1044
01:01:50.764 --> 01:01:52.597
[Sadewo] Look there, kid. Look!

1045
01:01:52.678 --> 01:01:54.303
- Thank you, Ma'am.
- [Rahmi] Yes.

1046
01:01:54.389 --> 01:01:55.912
Thank you.

1047
01:01:57.292 --> 01:01:58.459
[Sadewo] Come on.

1048
01:02:01.238 --> 01:02:09.238
[splashing waves]

1049
01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:17.541
[little Paris] What is that?

1050
01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:19.297
This is my age.

1051
01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:20.499
Eight?

1052
01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:22.289
Today is my birthday.

1053
01:02:22.373 --> 01:02:24.124
Happy birthday.

1054
01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:25.416
[little Bumi] Thank you.

1055
01:02:29.555 --> 01:02:33.014
And I will always wait for you here
even though I'm not sure you'll come.

1056
01:02:33.097 --> 01:02:41.097
[melodramatic music]

1057
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:43.805
I miss your stupid face.

1058
01:02:43.889 --> 01:02:51.349
[melodramatic music]

1059
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:55.178
I'll never let go
what I should have.

1060
01:02:58.174 --> 01:02:59.632
And I always hoped...

1061
01:03:00.805 --> 01:03:04.889
I could take a photo with my father when
on my eighth birthday and the years after.

1062
01:03:04.972 --> 01:03:10.847
[melodramatic music]

1063
01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:13.472
And after meeting you,
I always hope again.

1064
01:03:16.097 --> 01:03:19.764
I don't want to lose you
even though your father will hinder me.

1065
01:03:19.847 --> 01:03:27.847
[melodramatic music]

1066
01:03:35.097 --> 01:03:38.198
[footsteps moving away]

1067
01:03:38.279 --> 01:03:45.430
[footsteps approaching]

1068
01:03:45.514 --> 01:03:47.139
Mom.

1069
01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:54.133
What's wrong?

1070
01:03:54.217 --> 01:03:55.717
[Bumi] Missing Dad, huh?

1071
01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:01.708
I once asked the police...

1072
01:04:01.792 --> 01:04:05.667
to track the suspected vehicle
that ran over your father...

1073
01:04:06.646 --> 01:04:09.229
based on on-site testimony.

1074
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.875
But somehow...

1075
01:04:16.427 --> 01:04:18.343
the vehicle could not be tracked.

1076
01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:25.305
I'm only a commoner.

1077
01:04:27.443 --> 01:04:30.557
I didn't know what else I should do.

1078
01:04:30.757 --> 01:04:32.175
Calm down, Mom.

1079
01:04:39.783 --> 01:04:42.241
The person who took your father's life...

1080
01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:49.006
he also took away your life and my life.

1081
01:04:53.208 --> 01:04:56.125
He also killed any
chance for you to live...

1082
01:04:56.211 --> 01:04:58.461
with a father who loves you.

1083
01:04:59.753 --> 01:05:00.839
[sobbing]

1084
01:05:08.389 --> 01:05:09.930
[sobbing]

1085
01:05:10.146 --> 01:05:12.687
But that was a long time ago, Mom.

1086
01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:16.375
[Bumi] Are you still
looking for the perpetrator?

1087
01:05:16.461 --> 01:05:18.295
Do you want to sue the perpetrator?

1088
01:05:20.221 --> 01:05:21.929
If I sue, will...

1089
01:05:22.013 --> 01:05:23.804
your father come back?

1090
01:05:29.849 --> 01:05:30.849
Bumi.

1091
01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:36.390
Can you really forgive
the person who hit your father?

1092
01:05:48.635 --> 01:05:50.593
[Bumi] So, what do you want me to do, Mom?

1093
01:05:52.805 --> 01:05:54.014
Bumi.

1094
01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.755
Do you really like Paris?

1095
01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:02.305
What are you actually trying to say, Mom?

1096
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.500
Wait.

1097
01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:05.430
Why are you suddenly asking that?

1098
01:06:05.514 --> 01:06:07.120
[chair scraping]

1099
01:06:20.339 --> 01:06:22.172
Are you willing to accept...

1100
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.875
that the person who hit your father
was Paris' father?

1101
01:06:25.972 --> 01:06:32.068
[tense music]

1102
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:40.170
[tense music]

1103
01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:43.639
Mom, where's Dad?

1104
01:06:43.722 --> 01:06:45.680
[Rahmi] Right, why hasn't he come home yet?

1105
01:06:46.722 --> 01:06:52.784
[walking back and forth]

1106
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:54.680
Dad?

1107
01:06:58.037 --> 01:06:59.906
Ma'am, good evening.

1108
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:03.094
We found your husband in an accident.

1109
01:07:03.178 --> 01:07:06.601
[Police officer] Because the distance is quite
far, we didn't see the perpetrator's face.

1110
01:07:06.625 --> 01:07:11.271
All we found was this note
and a cake, Ma'am.

1111
01:07:14.685 --> 01:07:15.764
[Police officer] Mom?

1112
01:07:15.847 --> 01:07:17.097
[Bumi] Mom!

1113
01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.347
[Bumi] Mom!

1114
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:20.514
[Bumi] Mom!

1115
01:07:20.597 --> 01:07:23.448
- [Bumi] Mom!
- [Police officer] Ma'am?

1116
01:07:23.514 --> 01:07:25.612
[Police officer] Ma'am?

1117
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:33.680
[tense music]

1118
01:07:39.316 --> 01:07:42.331
[running footsteps]

1119
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:45.599
[tense music]

1120
01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.280
[Bumi] This was Mr. Sadewo's car, right?

1121
01:07:48.958 --> 01:07:50.500
Right. This was Mr. Sadewo's car.

1122
01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:57.583
[tense music]

1123
01:07:57.667 --> 01:08:04.667
[tense music]

1124
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:11.750
[tense music]

1125
01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:18.833
[tense music]

1126
01:08:18.917 --> 01:08:25.917
[tense music]

1127
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:33.000
[tense music]

1128
01:08:33.083 --> 01:08:40.625
[tense music]

1129
01:08:40.722 --> 01:08:43.065
[car crashing]

1130
01:08:43.139 --> 01:08:50.008
[tense music]

1131
01:08:50.083 --> 01:08:58.083
[tense music]

1132
01:08:59.292 --> 01:09:00.874
[Peter] Oh, dear.

1133
01:09:00.958 --> 01:09:03.576
[Peter] Mr. Sadewo was very drunk.
I even had to carry him.

1134
01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.875
And what I remember was
Siska drove the car.

1135
01:09:05.958 --> 01:09:13.375
[melodramatic music]

1136
01:09:13.458 --> 01:09:20.875
[melodramatic music]

1137
01:09:20.958 --> 01:09:27.958
[melodramatic music]

1138
01:09:28.042 --> 01:09:33.749
[melodramatic music]

1139
01:09:33.833 --> 01:09:35.500
[Sadewo] You know what, kid?

1140
01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:38.187
[Sadewo] When your
mother took you to Paris...

1141
01:09:39.859 --> 01:09:41.526
I wasn't just broken.

1142
01:09:43.674 --> 01:09:45.091
I was numb.

1143
01:09:46.787 --> 01:09:49.412
Numb with devastation and loss.

1144
01:09:50.987 --> 01:09:52.154
I realized...

1145
01:09:53.351 --> 01:09:55.768
I couldn't throw away my broken heart.

1146
01:09:59.966 --> 01:10:03.216
But I have a piece of that broken heart
that I always keep.

1147
01:10:04.468 --> 01:10:06.218
The one that made me survive.

1148
01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:16.425
[Paris] What a funny analogy, Dad.

1149
01:10:19.085 --> 01:10:21.020
Is that why you break me?

1150
01:10:21.104 --> 01:10:22.187
[Sadewo] Wait.

1151
01:10:22.271 --> 01:10:23.687
[Sadewo] Why do you say that?

1152
01:10:24.667 --> 01:10:28.499
What I mean is every time I see Bumi,
it's as if I see a part of me.

1153
01:10:28.583 --> 01:10:29.708
That's it.

1154
01:10:29.804 --> 01:10:31.763
Bumi is not you!

1155
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.222
And you should realize...

1156
01:10:36.305 --> 01:10:38.472
when you first met your child...

1157
01:10:38.555 --> 01:10:41.695
you should've made her happy.

1158
01:10:42.109 --> 01:10:43.616
Instead of bringing her down!

1159
01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:44.783
Listen, Paris.

1160
01:10:44.867 --> 01:10:47.249
Humans need to learn to fall
to learn to get up.

1161
01:10:47.333 --> 01:10:49.750
It takes a sense of loss
to be able to learn to find.

1162
01:10:50.292 --> 01:10:53.208
And it needs free space
to be able to grow and develop.

1163
01:10:53.305 --> 01:10:55.139
I've lost everything.

1164
01:10:55.222 --> 01:10:56.430
I've experienced that.

1165
01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:01.347
I don't want you to lose yourself.

1166
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:04.389
[melodramatic music]

1167
01:11:04.472 --> 01:11:05.639
You know what, Paris?

1168
01:11:06.972 --> 01:11:11.180
For every man, there is only one woman
in his heart all his life.

1169
01:11:11.264 --> 01:11:14.222
It doesn't matter
whether he'll get her or not.

1170
01:11:14.292 --> 01:11:21.208
[melodramatic music]

1171
01:11:21.273 --> 01:11:23.430
Do you know what I'm doing?

1172
01:11:23.514 --> 01:11:26.805
[melodramatic music]

1173
01:11:26.889 --> 01:11:28.055
Dad...

1174
01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:32.976
I'm fighting for what I truly love...

1175
01:11:36.389 --> 01:11:38.264
instead of giving up.

1176
01:11:38.347 --> 01:11:42.014
Because I don't know
what else I want to fight for.

1177
01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:44.847
I'm not you. Bumi is not you.

1178
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:46.290
- [Sadewo] Calm down.
- [Paris] No!

1179
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:50.062
[Sadewo] Don't cry.

1180
01:11:52.203 --> 01:11:53.439
[door knocking]

1181
01:11:53.514 --> 01:11:55.892
[sobbing]

1182
01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.205

1186
01:12:23.042 --> 01:12:29.775
[melodramatic music]

1187
01:12:29.859 --> 01:12:31.401
You haven't changed much.

1188
01:12:33.389 --> 01:12:36.139
Nobody changes.

1189
01:12:36.223 --> 01:12:37.931
I will change...

1190
01:12:38.015 --> 01:12:40.224
if you give me one more chance.

1191
01:12:44.847 --> 01:12:47.472
But I have to take responsibility
for something.

1192
01:12:49.143 --> 01:12:52.768
I might not be able to revive
the father of a child.

1193
01:12:55.097 --> 01:12:56.514
But at least...

1194
01:12:58.265 --> 01:13:00.265
I can give him justice.

1195
01:13:01.722 --> 01:13:03.097
Are you sure?

1196
01:13:04.365 --> 01:13:06.028
Are you...

1197
01:13:06.389 --> 01:13:08.264
doing this...

1198
01:13:08.347 --> 01:13:12.330
just because he's the man
your daughter loves?

1199
01:13:13.375 --> 01:13:14.667
No, Aryana.

1200
01:13:17.554 --> 01:13:21.263
I'm doing it because I want
to do something right in my life.

1201
01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:23.787
I'm tired.

1202
01:13:25.242 --> 01:13:29.451
Tired because all my life,
I have to make amends for all my mistakes.

1203
01:13:36.639 --> 01:13:39.180
I want us to be together again.

1204
01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.930
Me...

1205
01:13:44.014 --> 01:13:45.222
Paris...

1206
01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:47.389
and you.

1207
01:13:49.099 --> 01:13:52.766
[melodramatic music]

1208
01:13:52.847 --> 01:13:54.139
[Sadewo] Forgive me.

1209
01:13:54.222 --> 01:14:02.222
[melodramatic music]

1210
01:14:05.722 --> 01:14:07.264
[Sadewo] Will you forgive me?

1211
01:14:07.347 --> 01:14:14.763

[melodramatic music]

1216
01:14:38.597 --> 01:14:41.014
[Paris] I don't want to be
separated from Bumi, Mom.

1217
01:14:41.097 --> 01:14:43.499
[melodramatic music]

1218
01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:45.292
I love Bumi.

- [Paris] Are you freezing?
- No.

1231
01:16:08.555 --> 01:16:16.555
[melodramatic music]

1232
01:16:19.221 --> 01:16:20.236
[Paris] Bumi.

1233
01:16:24.042 --> 01:16:26.042
I don't want to be your pretend girlfriend.

1234
01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:29.842
Why are you so sweet?
