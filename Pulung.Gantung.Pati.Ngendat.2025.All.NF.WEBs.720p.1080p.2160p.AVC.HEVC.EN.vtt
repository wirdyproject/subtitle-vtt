3
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.041
Help.

4
00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:22.833
Mom!

5
00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.583
Mom!

6
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.708
Mom!

7
00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:04.291
God's peace and blessings be upon you.

8
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.458
God's peace and blessings be upon you.

9
00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:31.166
Hello, is this Ryan,

10
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.291
<i>the son of Prasetyo?</i>

11
00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:34.583
I'm sorry, but…

12
00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:36.958
- who is this?
- My name is Karsidi.

13
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:39.083
<i>Your father passed away.</i>

14
00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:42.541
To God we belong, and to Him we return.

15
00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:45.416
Can you… come here?

16
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.416
I'll send you the address.

17
00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:50.166
<i>There is…</i>

18
00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:55.458
something your father left for you.

19
00:02:56.583 --> 00:02:57.875
Sir?

20
00:02:58.416 --> 00:02:59.875
Sir?

21
00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.291
Hello?

22
00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:44.375
- Mom.
- What's wrong?

23
00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:51.958
Dad passed away.

24
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:55.791
How do you know?

25
00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:57.541
A man just called me.

26
00:03:58.375 --> 00:03:59.958
His name is Karsidi.

27
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:01.416
Do you know him?

28
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.708
I don't know any Karsidi.

29
00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:04.458
Why don't you call him back?

30
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.041
Are you sure you heard right?

31
00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:25.166
Yes.

32
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.291
Mr. Karsidi said
that Dad left me something.

33
00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:30.625
Then the call got disconnected.

34
00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:38.083
Should we… go there, Mom?

35
00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:39.750
There's no need.

36
00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:41.791
You know why, right?

37
00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:43.416
Yes.

38
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:45.916
He gambled,

39
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.000
he cheated on you,

40
00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.500
and you can't forgive him.

41
00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:55.291
But he's still my father.

42
00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:56.833
I'm just wondering.

43
00:04:56.916 --> 00:04:59.083
It's been ten years since I last saw him...

44
00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:00.541
There's no need.

45
00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:05.458
Don't go there.

46
00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:08.500
Just pray for him. That should be enough.

47
00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:21.375
FORWARDED

48
00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:41.541
Ryan.

49
00:05:45.166 --> 00:05:46.458
Ryan.

50
00:05:56.833 --> 00:05:58.791
<i>Mom, I'm sorry.</i>

51
00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:01.541
<i>I feel like I have to see Dad.</i>

52
00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.000
Ryan.

53
00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:11.291
If we weren't related,

54
00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:13.208
I wouldn't be here with you.

55
00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:15.583
I'd rather go riding
with my motorcycle club.

56
00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:17.500
I feel bad

57
00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:19.875
for leaving without my mom's permission.

58
00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.041
I know it's wrong.

59
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.166
But I left her a message,

60
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.666
so everything should be all right.

61
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.666
Sometimes it's okay to break the rules.

62
00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:32.750
Ryan.

63
00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:35.416
How far have you gone with Alana?

64
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.375
Watch your mouth.

65
00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:40.000
- Did you do anything stupid?
- No.

66
00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:41.458
Seriously, no.

67
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.208
Are you still with him?

68
00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:52.291
No, I swear.

69
00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:53.750
Just block his number.

70
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.583
Hello, Mom.

71
00:07:06.208 --> 00:07:07.333
Yes.

72
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.708
Okay, hang on.

73
00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:13.083
Ryan, my mom wants to talk.

74
00:07:14.791 --> 00:07:16.291
Yes, ma'am?

75
00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:18.250
Yes, we'll go straight home.

76
00:07:19.416 --> 00:07:21.875
Okay, peace be upon you.

77
00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:24.625
You have such a spoiled girlfriend.

78
00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:28.541
My friend is anything but spoiled.

79
00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:30.875
Don't act like you know her.

80
00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:34.000
- And this one is fierce.
- That's enough.

81
00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:38.500
Here, your phone…

82
00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:42.333
What the hell, Ryan?

83
00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:47.125
What's wrong?

84
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:52.166
No, nothing.

85
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.083
Let's just keep going.

86
00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:58.250
It's nothing, let's go.

87
00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:16.375
- Mr. Karsidi?
- Yes.

88
00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:19.750
Ryan, Prasetyo's son.

89
00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:20.833
Yes.

90
00:08:20.916 --> 00:08:24.416
Sorry, our call got disconnected.

91
00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:27.083
The reception here is bad.

92
00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:29.125
Yes, it's fine, sir.

93
00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:33.208
These are my friends, Elsa, Alana, Ben.

94
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.458
Your mother didn't come?

95
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:37.666
No, sir.

96
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.250
First of all, I'm sorry.

97
00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:42.666
But we have buried your father.

98
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.833
How… did he die?

99
00:08:47.916 --> 00:08:51.250
Your father hanged himself to death.

100
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.791
Be strong.

101
00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:09.833
That is your father's grave.

102
00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:17.416
PRASETYO SON OF SUKAMTO
MARCH 20, 1976 - AUGUST 1, 2024

103
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.041
Why is his tombstone black?

104
00:09:20.916 --> 00:09:25.791
It's a sign that the deceased…

105
00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:27.583
was a victim of <i>pulung gantung.</i>

106
00:09:27.666 --> 00:09:29.041
I'm sorry, what?

107
00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:31.291
What is <i>pulung gantung?</i>

108
00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.458
<i>Pulung gantung</i> is a spiritual being.

109
00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:37.208
A demon.

110
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:40.083
It takes the form of a fireball.

111
00:09:40.166 --> 00:09:42.875
Two weeks before he died,

112
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.416
your father showed signs of stress.

113
00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:49.333
He locked himself in.

114
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.666
He was targeted by <i>pulung gantung.</i>

115
00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:57.416
Once <i>pulung gantung</i> set its target,
the target would live a miserable life,

116
00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:02.291
and eventually,
he would hang himself to death.

117
00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:05.500
You see that grave?

118
00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:09.375
That's the grave of Nining, my sister.

119
00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:11.750
She was also the victim of <i>pulung gantung.</i>

120
00:10:11.833 --> 00:10:14.208
That's why her tombstone is black.

121
00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:52.125
This is the key.

122
00:10:52.208 --> 00:10:53.583
- Please.
- Yes, sir.

123
00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:56.666
Were you very close with my father?

124
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.625
I worked with Mr. Prasetyo.

125
00:10:59.708 --> 00:11:02.583
Sometimes I helped him
take care of his field.

126
00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:06.750
If you need anything,
I live nearby. Over there.

127
00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.458
All right, sir. Thank you.

128
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:10.666
Ryan.

129
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.708
Why don't we look for a hotel?

130
00:11:12.791 --> 00:11:14.250
It's best to stay here.

131
00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:16.958
There are no hotels nearby.

132
00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:19.875
I'd better get going.

133
00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.583
Yes, please, sir.

134
00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:25.458
Ryan.

135
00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:28.208
What did your father leave for you?

136
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:30.166
Mr. Karsidi just said

137
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:35.958
it's inside… a carved wooden box.

138
00:11:36.041 --> 00:11:38.458
Let's go home once you find the box.

139
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:40.416
Worried about the <i>pulung gantung</i> story?

140
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.541
So, she's spoiled and a coward.

141
00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.166
Let's go inside.

142
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Well? Have you found it?

143
00:12:12.458 --> 00:12:13.458
Not yet.

144
00:12:15.625 --> 00:12:17.375
But it's been two hours.

145
00:12:18.833 --> 00:12:20.583
I haven't found it, Ben.

146
00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:40.250
Elsa.

147
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.583
I'm scared.

148
00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:44.750
Why don't you come inside with me?

149
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.875
Can I just wait outside?

150
00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.083
Will that be okay?

151
00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:52.416
Okay, I'm not going to lock the door.
You wait there, okay?

152
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.833
Don't worry.

153
00:12:53.916 --> 00:12:55.083
Make it quick.

154
00:12:55.166 --> 00:12:56.125
I'll wait here.

155
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.125
- Alana.
- Elsa.

156
00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:17.708
What's wrong?

157
00:13:17.791 --> 00:13:18.916
Alana.

158
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.250
What's wrong?

159
00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.250
What did you see?

160
00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:23.416
Alana?

161
00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.750
Come on. Let's get out of here.

162
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.125
I want to go home now, Ryan.

163
00:13:37.208 --> 00:13:40.416
But the thing is,
I haven't found the box yet.

164
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.541
Is that all you worry about, Ryan?

165
00:13:43.458 --> 00:13:45.333
Don't you feel sorry for Alana?

166
00:13:45.916 --> 00:13:48.125
She's never experienced
anything like this.

167
00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:50.583
It's your call.

168
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.416
If you want to leave, let's go.

169
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.375
If you want to stay, fine.

170
00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:58.083
But I don't want to drive.

171
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.625
Where are you going?

172
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.500
I… want to make out…

173
00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:14.750
in the middle of this cold night.

174
00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:16.958
Boom!

175
00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.416
Weird.

176
00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:10.291
You're burning up, Alana.

177
00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:16.500
What should we do, Ryan?

178
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.666
I have some medicine in the car.
Wait here.

179
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.291
Hey, Ryan. Your mother called me.

180
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.333
I think she's worried about you.

181
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.500
You should call her.

182
00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:32.666
I will.

183
00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:48.333
Geez, what is that?

184
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.125
That's <i>pulung gantung.</i>

185
00:15:51.208 --> 00:15:52.791
No, it's a meteor, Ryan.

186
00:15:53.416 --> 00:15:55.708
Ben. Give this to Alana.

187
00:15:55.791 --> 00:15:57.708
- She's your girlfriend, Ryan.
- Hurry!

188
00:16:15.125 --> 00:16:16.958
Why are you following me?

189
00:16:17.625 --> 00:16:18.708
You follow the meteor?

190
00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:20.875
That's not a meteor.
That's <i>pulung gantung.</i>

191
00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.791
Whatever. But, why?

192
00:16:24.041 --> 00:16:27.708
Mr. Karsidi said that <i>pulung gantung</i>
is the cause of my dad's death. Right?

193
00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:28.625
Yes.

194
00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:31.208
This is my chance to prove it.

195
00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:36.750
- Ben.
<i>- Aku arep ngendhat.</i>

196
00:16:36.833 --> 00:16:39.416
<i>Aku arep ngendhat.</i>

197
00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.250
<i>Aku arep ngendhat.</i>

198
00:16:43.083 --> 00:16:45.791
<i>Aku arep ngendhat.</i>

199
00:16:47.375 --> 00:16:49.875
Help. My wife needs help.

200
00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.708
<i>- Aku arep ngendhat.</i>
- Ben.

201
00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:56.458
Help! Honey.

202
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:57.666
Honey.

203
00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.916
Wake up, honey.

204
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.250
Wake up, honey.

205
00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:06.458
Help.

206
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:25.125
Ryan, wait for me.

207
00:17:32.708 --> 00:17:34.625
Lord have mercy.

208
00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:44.583
Sir, I tried to help.

209
00:17:44.666 --> 00:17:45.666
It's okay.

210
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.250
Is it true that she was possessed
by <i>pulung gantung?</i>

211
00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:49.375
Yes.

212
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.208
Honey.

213
00:17:55.416 --> 00:17:57.416
Why does it have to end like this, honey?

214
00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.291
Why, honey?

215
00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.583
Let's get her down.

216
00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:09.750
What is happening?

217
00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:13.708
It means the next victim

218
00:18:13.791 --> 00:18:16.375
of <i>pulung gantung</i> will be from that area.

219
00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:19.041
But we can't tell who.

220
00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:26.041
In the name of God, the Most Gracious
and the Most Merciful.

221
00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:28.666
Ya-Sin.

222
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.291
By the wise Qur'an.

223
00:18:31.375 --> 00:18:34.708
Indeed you, Muhammad,
are among the messengers,

224
00:18:34.791 --> 00:18:37.750
on a straight path.

225
00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:40.541
The spirits of the <i>pulung gantung</i> victims

226
00:18:40.625 --> 00:18:42.625
are still here,

227
00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:45.750
venting their anger to those
who are still alive.

228
00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:47.750
Because their lives

229
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:50.750
were taken before their time.

230
00:18:51.458 --> 00:18:54.958
Excuse me, sir, but we have to go.

231
00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:56.291
Please.

232
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.958
Hey.

233
00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:16.583
Are you Prasetyo's son?

234
00:19:16.666 --> 00:19:18.333
You have to leave!

235
00:19:18.416 --> 00:19:19.541
Get out of here!

236
00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:21.750
Go away!

237
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.375
What's their problem, Ryan?

238
00:22:16.416 --> 00:22:19.666
Alana!

239
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.541
Alana. Oh, my God.

240
00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:23.666
Alana!

241
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.291
Ryan!

242
00:22:27.375 --> 00:22:30.416
- Alana.
- Elsa, what's wrong with Alana?

243
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.875
- Elsa, what's wrong?
- I don't know, Ryan.

244
00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:35.416
Alana.

245
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.958
- Pray, Alana.
- Alana.

246
00:22:41.666 --> 00:22:43.541
Alana.

247
00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:44.708
Alana.

248
00:22:45.708 --> 00:22:48.041
Alana.

249
00:22:48.125 --> 00:22:49.500
Alana.

250
00:22:52.875 --> 00:22:54.541
Dear Lord.

251
00:22:57.125 --> 00:23:00.083
<i>Aku arep ngendhat.</i>

252
00:23:03.625 --> 00:23:05.625
- Alana.
- Alana.

253
00:23:07.666 --> 00:23:12.458
- Alana, stop!
- Stop it, Alana!

254
00:23:13.583 --> 00:23:16.583
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious
and the Most Merciful.

255
00:23:26.875 --> 00:23:28.041
Alana.

256
00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:30.291
Alana.

257
00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:32.333
Alana.

258
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.541
- Wake up.
- Alana, wake up.

259
00:23:42.166 --> 00:23:43.583
Let's lay her down.

260
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.541
OUTER RING ROAD - AIRPORT
JAGORAWI TOLL ROAD

261
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:04.291
Hello. Ryan, where have you been?
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

262
00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:05.583
I'm sorry, Mom.

263
00:24:05.666 --> 00:24:08.333
I'm so worried. Where are you now?

264
00:24:08.416 --> 00:24:11.083
Mom, a lot of people died in this village

265
00:24:11.166 --> 00:24:14.541
because they were possessed,
including Dad.

266
00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:16.375
He hanged himself to death.

267
00:24:17.708 --> 00:24:18.958
Are you okay, Ryan?

268
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:21.291
Yes, I'm fine, but Alana…

269
00:24:21.375 --> 00:24:22.333
What's wrong?

270
00:24:22.416 --> 00:24:23.750
Alana is not herself.

271
00:24:23.833 --> 00:24:27.125
And she said, <i>"Aku arep ngendhat."</i>

272
00:24:27.208 --> 00:24:29.083
Ryan, listen to me.

273
00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:31.666
Just leave that village, now.

274
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.625
It means she wants to hang herself.

275
00:24:33.708 --> 00:24:36.375
I'll explain to you later.
Just leave that village, now.

276
00:24:36.458 --> 00:24:37.916
You know about <i>pulung gantung?</i>

277
00:24:39.083 --> 00:24:40.125
Mom?

278
00:24:40.208 --> 00:24:42.250
Hello, Ryan? Ryan?

279
00:24:44.166 --> 00:24:45.875
Ben, hurry!

280
00:24:47.125 --> 00:24:48.583
Ben, open the door.

281
00:24:50.416 --> 00:24:51.583
Get in.

282
00:24:52.625 --> 00:24:53.833
Hurry, Ben.

283
00:24:58.416 --> 00:25:00.000
Okay, let's go.

284
00:25:06.833 --> 00:25:07.958
Damn it.

285
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.416
- What's wrong?
- We've got flat tires.

286
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.625
Ryan.

287
00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:15.166
What's wrong?

288
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.625
Flat tires, front and back.

289
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.333
Ben. There are knife marks.

290
00:25:32.666 --> 00:25:34.791
Somebody must have pulled a prank on us.

291
00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:36.416
You can't be sure about that.

292
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.125
Think. If it were a nail,
it would make sense.

293
00:25:40.208 --> 00:25:41.500
But this is a knife.

294
00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:42.791
Ben is right.

295
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:44.708
Somebody did this to us, Ryan.

296
00:25:44.791 --> 00:25:46.416
No, we have to go home tonight.

297
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.708
- We can't...
- Yes, we have to go home tonight.

298
00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:51.416
We have to find another car.

299
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.208
What about my car?

300
00:25:53.291 --> 00:25:55.625
My dad needs it the day after tomorrow.

301
00:25:55.708 --> 00:25:59.083
Ben, why don't you call your dad

302
00:25:59.166 --> 00:26:02.666
and explain the situation here?
He'll understand.

303
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.458
I'm not going back home
before this car is fixed.

304
00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:09.916
But if you insist,
go ahead and leave me behind.

305
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.416
Ben.

306
00:26:35.125 --> 00:26:39.041
If I were you,
I would worry about the car.

307
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:43.875
Don't you feel like
the people here are weird?

308
00:26:45.291 --> 00:26:46.375
Weird how?

309
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:51.125
From the way they look at you,
it's like they're angry, annoyed,

310
00:26:51.208 --> 00:26:54.416
it's like you did something wrong.

311
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.958
What did I do?

312
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.375
Maybe it's just in my head.

313
00:27:00.791 --> 00:27:02.250
I'll go and fix the tires.

314
00:27:24.458 --> 00:27:25.750
Typical Ben.

315
00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:28.583
Drinking in secret.

316
00:27:29.666 --> 00:27:31.208
I'll go and tell Ryan.

317
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:33.458
He's going to be mad if he finds out.

318
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:35.000
Well then, stop it.

319
00:27:38.541 --> 00:27:39.958
What about the tires?

320
00:27:40.458 --> 00:27:41.875
I've changed it.

321
00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:44.541
Not the one at the back.

322
00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.416
No. There's only one spare tire.

323
00:27:53.875 --> 00:27:55.958
SUICIDE IN GUNUNG KIDUL

324
00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:58.333
I think it's this village.

325
00:28:00.208 --> 00:28:02.416
Ben. Look at this.

326
00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:05.583
What is it?

327
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.416
This is crazy.

328
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.666
Kidul Village has the highest number
of hanging cases in the last five years.

329
00:28:14.916 --> 00:28:17.416
They were all caused
by <i>pulung gantung,</i> Ben.

330
00:28:23.458 --> 00:28:25.291
This village is bad news.

331
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.875
Okay, I'll go look for a tire repairman.

332
00:30:27.291 --> 00:30:28.458
Alana.

333
00:30:29.291 --> 00:30:30.333
Alana.

334
00:30:36.208 --> 00:30:37.541
Alana.

335
00:30:47.333 --> 00:30:48.583
What's wrong?

336
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:52.708
Nothing.

337
00:30:56.708 --> 00:30:58.250
I saw…

338
00:30:59.125 --> 00:31:01.333
someone came towards Alana.

339
00:31:05.416 --> 00:31:06.583
What do you mean?

340
00:31:11.041 --> 00:31:12.166
Alana.

341
00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:15.958
- Alana.
- Alana.

342
00:31:18.125 --> 00:31:19.625
Alana.

343
00:31:21.083 --> 00:31:22.333
Alana.

344
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.666
Put it down!

345
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.208
- No!
- Put it down, Alana.

346
00:31:28.291 --> 00:31:30.875
Alana!

347
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.541
Stop it, Alana.

348
00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:45.958
- Alana.
- Alana.

349
00:31:46.791 --> 00:31:48.166
Alana!

350
00:31:51.541 --> 00:31:52.750
Alana.

351
00:31:52.833 --> 00:31:55.458
Alana.

352
00:31:56.125 --> 00:31:59.125
Alana, wake up. This is me, Ryan.

353
00:31:59.208 --> 00:32:02.083
Alana, what are you going to do?

354
00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:05.083
Alana, get down, don't jump.

355
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:10.916
Ben, help me!

356
00:32:12.666 --> 00:32:15.166
Cut the rope, Ben.

357
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.375
All right. Hang on, Ryan.

358
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:20.208
Ben.

359
00:32:24.458 --> 00:32:25.791
Come on, Ben.

360
00:32:25.875 --> 00:32:27.458
Done, Ryan.

361
00:32:28.416 --> 00:32:29.791
Get down.

362
00:32:45.375 --> 00:32:46.625
Wake up, Alana.

363
00:32:48.666 --> 00:32:50.666
Come on, Alana.

364
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:57.000
Alana.

365
00:32:58.541 --> 00:32:59.791
Alana.

366
00:33:00.833 --> 00:33:03.500
Alana has never experienced
something like…

367
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:07.750
- Mom.
- Alana.

368
00:33:07.833 --> 00:33:09.083
Aunt Marlina.

369
00:33:09.666 --> 00:33:10.875
How's Alana?

370
00:33:10.958 --> 00:33:14.666
- She just hanged herself.
- Come here, lay her down.

371
00:33:15.208 --> 00:33:17.166
Come. Easy.

372
00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:22.583
Do you have a white piece of paper?

373
00:33:33.083 --> 00:33:34.083
Alana.

374
00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:37.000
Exhale three times, dear.

375
00:33:38.291 --> 00:33:40.666
Come on.

376
00:33:55.875 --> 00:33:58.791
Alana is still possessed
by <i>pulung gantung.</i>

377
00:33:58.875 --> 00:34:01.416
Now, I need you to take Alana
to the bedroom.

378
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.125
What are you going to do?

379
00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:04.708
Get some jujube leaves.

380
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:06.041
Let's go.

381
00:34:24.708 --> 00:34:27.750
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious
and the Most Merciful.

382
00:34:32.708 --> 00:34:34.041
Elsa, please.

383
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:44.125
So, you know about
<i>pulung gantung</i> in this village?

384
00:34:46.625 --> 00:34:48.041
Since you were a kid,

385
00:34:49.083 --> 00:34:51.375
<i>pulung gantung</i> has been around
in Kidul Village,

386
00:34:51.458 --> 00:34:53.625
but I never wanted to tell you about it.

387
00:35:01.083 --> 00:35:02.125
Alana.

388
00:35:04.583 --> 00:35:05.791
If you have…

389
00:35:06.916 --> 00:35:09.291
something that's bothering your mind,

390
00:35:10.416 --> 00:35:12.875
or something that makes you restless,

391
00:35:12.958 --> 00:35:15.000
you can tell me. It's okay.

392
00:35:16.375 --> 00:35:17.333
I…

393
00:35:20.416 --> 00:35:23.791
did it with my ex-boyfriend
until I got pregnant, Elsa.

394
00:35:24.583 --> 00:35:25.875
Did…

395
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.166
Ferdy?

396
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.458
Of course.

397
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.708
Before Ryan came into my life,
I've only been with Ferdy.

398
00:35:39.083 --> 00:35:40.875
I asked him to take responsibility,

399
00:35:42.208 --> 00:35:44.250
but he broke up with me.

400
00:35:47.583 --> 00:35:50.000
Before the fetus was a month old,

401
00:35:52.375 --> 00:35:54.625
I had an abortion.

402
00:35:55.708 --> 00:35:57.250
Does Ryan know?

403
00:36:00.875 --> 00:36:02.000
No.

404
00:36:04.041 --> 00:36:06.500
That's what bothers me everyday.

405
00:36:07.333 --> 00:36:09.250
I love Ryan so much.

406
00:36:49.791 --> 00:36:51.416
I'm sorry.

407
00:36:53.583 --> 00:36:55.375
Why did you lie to me?

408
00:37:03.541 --> 00:37:08.250
Not all girls are brave enough
to be honest about that, Ryan.

409
00:37:09.416 --> 00:37:11.166
You thought I'd turn my back on you?

410
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.916
- Is that so?
- No.

411
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.750
I'm just scared that you're not ready
to see the bad side of me.

412
00:37:18.791 --> 00:37:21.666
I love you so much.

413
00:37:28.458 --> 00:37:29.916
I'm sorry.

414
00:37:33.916 --> 00:37:36.166
But now, everything is up to you.

415
00:38:26.875 --> 00:38:28.208
Alana.

416
00:38:29.416 --> 00:38:31.791
Alana.

417
00:38:31.875 --> 00:38:33.000
Alana.

418
00:38:33.625 --> 00:38:34.916
Alana.

419
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:36.750
Alana.

420
00:38:36.833 --> 00:38:38.125
Alana.

421
00:38:40.416 --> 00:38:42.250
Alana.

422
00:38:42.916 --> 00:38:44.416
Alana.

423
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:47.333
Ryan.

424
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.333
Alana.

425
00:38:49.416 --> 00:38:52.875
Beg for God's forgiveness, Alana.

426
00:38:52.958 --> 00:38:54.666
Alana.

427
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:57.208
Lord, have mercy.

428
00:38:57.291 --> 00:38:59.416
Say it, Alana.

429
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.125
- Get the rope.
- Lord, have mercy.

430
00:39:03.208 --> 00:39:04.791
Alana.

431
00:39:09.916 --> 00:39:11.958
Ryan, take her to the barn.

432
00:39:12.041 --> 00:39:13.000
Hurry!

433
00:39:34.666 --> 00:39:38.625
I seek refuge with Allah.

434
00:39:42.708 --> 00:39:46.000
Pray.

435
00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:51.500
Pray, Alana.

436
00:39:52.416 --> 00:39:58.250
Ask for God's mercy, Alana.

437
00:40:46.333 --> 00:40:47.458
Leave her!

438
00:40:48.583 --> 00:40:50.000
Leave her!

439
00:40:50.916 --> 00:40:52.458
Leave her!

440
00:40:55.208 --> 00:40:56.750
Leave her!

441
00:41:09.208 --> 00:41:11.000
Stop torturing her!

442
00:41:11.083 --> 00:41:13.666
Leave her!

443
00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.500
Aunt Marlina?

444
00:41:33.375 --> 00:41:35.041
I'm Nyi Darsih,

445
00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.666
your protector.

446
00:41:39.958 --> 00:41:41.291
<i>Pulung gantung…</i>

447
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.875
can attack the people you love.

448
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.500
Don't be a big mouth!

449
00:42:16.041 --> 00:42:19.125
I know who you are,

450
00:42:20.416 --> 00:42:22.916
the demon Banaspati.

451
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.333
I know what you do.

452
00:42:26.416 --> 00:42:31.708
You mislead people
and you make them miserable.

453
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:34.458
This is none of your business.

454
00:42:34.541 --> 00:42:36.416
Stay out of this.

455
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:40.375
Get back, you old witch!

456
00:42:40.458 --> 00:42:44.833
Or do you want to be
burned along with your body?

457
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.500
Even if you have
a thousand demons behind you,

458
00:42:50.583 --> 00:42:53.041
I will not back down.

459
00:42:55.375 --> 00:42:57.583
You don't know who I am.

460
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:00.333
You mess with humans,

461
00:43:00.416 --> 00:43:02.875
you mess with me!

462
00:43:08.666 --> 00:43:11.708
Make a barrier of yellow bamboo.

463
00:43:16.166 --> 00:43:18.333
<i>Put her in the middle.</i>

464
00:43:21.875 --> 00:43:23.125
Ben.

465
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:28.708
Dig Ki Sangkut's grave
and get his sacred ring.

466
00:43:28.791 --> 00:43:30.666
Where is Ki Sangkut buried?

467
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.250
In Blarong Cave,

468
00:43:32.333 --> 00:43:35.208
in the south forest. It's far from here.

469
00:43:35.291 --> 00:43:38.166
- What is she trying to do?
- Let's just listen first, Ben.

470
00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:42.125
Put that ring on this woman's finger.

471
00:43:42.666 --> 00:43:44.333
We need Ki Sangkut's ring.

472
00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:45.666
Who is Ki Sangkut?

473
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.500
He was a black magic shaman.

474
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:50.083
He controlled all the spirits here.

475
00:43:50.166 --> 00:43:52.208
But he died five years ago

476
00:43:52.291 --> 00:43:57.208
because he forgot to sacrifice
12 wild boars

477
00:43:57.291 --> 00:43:58.833
every Kliwon Friday.

478
00:43:58.916 --> 00:44:00.000
Thanks for telling us.

479
00:44:00.083 --> 00:44:03.541
The forbidden forest is dangerous.
There are a lot of spirits there.

480
00:44:03.625 --> 00:44:05.625
Ben, what time is it?

481
00:44:09.958 --> 00:44:12.541
Good. Let's go there now.

482
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.916
How do you know about the ring?

483
00:44:23.916 --> 00:44:27.250
They won't be able to get
Ki Sangkut's ring.

484
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.750
Although you trap me here,

485
00:44:35.916 --> 00:44:40.500
his followers
are still going to answer to me…

486
00:44:41.291 --> 00:44:44.916
- do whatever I say.
- Don't believe her.

487
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.791
She's just trying to scare us.

488
00:44:52.208 --> 00:44:54.000
Can I have a drink?

489
00:44:54.666 --> 00:44:57.000
Hurry up and drink. We have to move fast.

490
00:45:04.458 --> 00:45:05.708
Ben!

491
00:45:05.791 --> 00:45:07.125
Ryan!

492
00:45:08.625 --> 00:45:09.708
Ryan.

493
00:45:09.791 --> 00:45:11.000
My dad, Ryan.

494
00:45:11.083 --> 00:45:11.916
No.

495
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.458
Remember, don't look…

496
00:45:16.458 --> 00:45:20.041
if you hear anything in the forest.

497
00:45:20.125 --> 00:45:22.208
- That's impossible.
- My dad, Ryan.

498
00:45:22.291 --> 00:45:23.916
Where are you going?

499
00:45:24.833 --> 00:45:26.791
What are you going to do there?

500
00:45:27.375 --> 00:45:29.125
Come home with me.

501
00:45:29.208 --> 00:45:31.041
That's my dad, Ryan.

502
00:45:31.125 --> 00:45:33.708
Ben, don't. Ben.

503
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.708
Ghost!

504
00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:40.541
Ben!

505
00:46:01.875 --> 00:46:03.208
Ben!

506
00:46:07.083 --> 00:46:08.791
Ben!

507
00:46:08.875 --> 00:46:11.500
Find the corpse
of the black stone whisperer.

508
00:46:38.833 --> 00:46:42.833
<i>Dig the grave… with bloodied hands.</i>

509
00:46:51.791 --> 00:46:52.833
Ben.

510
00:46:52.916 --> 00:46:54.083
Are you okay?

511
00:46:54.166 --> 00:46:56.750
This forest is the home of demons, Ryan!

512
00:46:59.208 --> 00:47:02.041
Okay, we have to be quick.
We have five hours left.

513
00:47:02.125 --> 00:47:03.708
- Come on.
- Let's go.

514
00:47:10.333 --> 00:47:11.333
Aunt Marlina.

515
00:47:11.833 --> 00:47:14.375
I hope Ryan and Ben can make it.

516
00:47:18.041 --> 00:47:21.583
Nyi Darsih has been playing with you.

517
00:47:22.583 --> 00:47:25.208
That ring is destroyed.

518
00:47:25.291 --> 00:47:26.791
Don't listen to her.

519
00:47:27.333 --> 00:47:30.791
<i>Pulung gantung</i> has possessed
Alana's mind and body.

520
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.375
That is not Alana that we see.

521
00:47:39.958 --> 00:47:41.541
Pull out the stick, Elsa!

522
00:47:43.916 --> 00:47:46.208
Aunt Marlina.

523
00:47:47.458 --> 00:47:49.666
Aunt Marlina, help!

524
00:47:51.208 --> 00:47:53.250
No, Elsa!

525
00:47:53.333 --> 00:47:54.833
Don't pull it out, Elsa!

526
00:47:54.916 --> 00:47:57.833
Elsa, stop! Don't!

527
00:47:57.916 --> 00:47:59.791
No!

528
00:48:10.125 --> 00:48:12.041
Elsa, don't!

529
00:48:44.833 --> 00:48:46.041
Ben.

530
00:48:46.958 --> 00:48:48.250
Blarong Cave.

531
00:48:49.625 --> 00:48:51.125
What are we waiting for?

532
00:48:51.208 --> 00:48:52.291
Come on.

533
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.541
This is nuts.

534
00:49:19.916 --> 00:49:21.833
This must be the grave of Ki Sangkut.

535
00:49:23.708 --> 00:49:25.125
No.

536
00:49:25.208 --> 00:49:26.333
No.

537
00:49:26.416 --> 00:49:27.791
I don't think so.

538
00:49:27.875 --> 00:49:29.916
I think the grave is still far inside.

539
00:49:41.083 --> 00:49:43.166
A ghost!

540
00:49:47.416 --> 00:49:49.291
- You're good?
- I'm good.

541
00:49:55.916 --> 00:49:57.958
This way. Let's go, Ben.

542
00:50:05.083 --> 00:50:06.375
Let's go.

543
00:50:17.208 --> 00:50:18.416
Ryan.

544
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.208
Is that the grave?

545
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.208
Yes, come on.

546
00:50:37.916 --> 00:50:39.083
Where is the hoe?

547
00:50:39.166 --> 00:50:41.000
- Are you sure it's this one?
- Yes.

548
00:50:41.083 --> 00:50:42.208
Come on.

549
00:50:52.625 --> 00:50:55.166
- This is rock, not soil.
- Oh, no.

550
00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:58.500
Wait, Ben.

551
00:50:58.583 --> 00:50:59.958
Listen to me.

552
00:51:00.041 --> 00:51:02.625
I saw a human skull,

553
00:51:02.708 --> 00:51:04.541
and it gave me a clue.

554
00:51:04.625 --> 00:51:06.541
- Are you being serious?
- Yes.

555
00:51:06.625 --> 00:51:08.125
Okay.

556
00:51:08.791 --> 00:51:11.041
We have to make our hands bleed.

557
00:51:11.125 --> 00:51:14.375
- This is unbelievable.
- Yes, we dig with our hands.

558
00:51:14.458 --> 00:51:15.833
- With our hands?
- Yes.

559
00:51:15.916 --> 00:51:17.208
This is ridiculous, Ryan.

560
00:51:17.291 --> 00:51:20.500
- I swear, this is ridiculous.
- All right, that's fine.

561
00:51:20.583 --> 00:51:22.208
You don't want to do it. I will.

562
00:51:26.125 --> 00:51:27.750
Don't do anything crazy, Ryan.

563
00:51:27.833 --> 00:51:29.541
- Don't…
- Give me that!

564
00:51:58.416 --> 00:52:00.083
Bear with the pain.

565
00:52:00.166 --> 00:52:02.375
Come on.

566
00:52:21.333 --> 00:52:22.500
Okay.

567
00:52:22.583 --> 00:52:23.958
It's done.

568
00:52:26.333 --> 00:52:28.875
One, two, three.

569
00:52:32.666 --> 00:52:34.833
- Take this, Ryan.
- Yes.

570
00:52:41.833 --> 00:52:43.208
The ring.

571
00:52:45.041 --> 00:52:46.166
Come on, Ryan.

572
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:47.541
Hurry, Ryan.

573
00:52:47.625 --> 00:52:49.583
God, it's so hard.

574
00:52:52.333 --> 00:52:53.833
He's awake!

575
00:52:53.916 --> 00:52:56.750
- He's awake. Hurry, Ryan.
- Ben.

576
00:52:56.833 --> 00:52:58.583
I'll smack him with the hoe.

577
00:52:58.666 --> 00:53:00.583
I'll smack him!

578
00:53:04.958 --> 00:53:06.666
Hurry!

579
00:53:16.833 --> 00:53:20.041
Have you pulled out the ring, Ben?

580
00:53:20.125 --> 00:53:22.166
- Have you, Ben?
- Hang on, Ryan!

581
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:25.333
- The corpse is awake.
- Hang on, Ryan!

582
00:53:25.416 --> 00:53:27.791
I got it. Come on!

583
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:39.250
- Watch out. Be careful.
- Yes.

584
00:53:55.208 --> 00:53:58.125
Ben, we have to hurry.
We only have three hours.

585
00:53:58.208 --> 00:53:59.375
- Yes.
- Come on, Ben.

586
00:53:59.458 --> 00:54:00.583
Yes, Ryan.

587
00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:15.500
I'm sorry.

588
00:54:15.583 --> 00:54:17.500
I had to knock you out.

589
00:54:19.083 --> 00:54:20.500
Aunt Marlina.

590
00:54:23.125 --> 00:54:24.041
Aunt Marlina.

591
00:54:24.125 --> 00:54:26.875
Aunt Marlina, I'm sorry.
I didn't know what I was doing.

592
00:54:26.958 --> 00:54:28.583
- I'm sorry, Aunt Marlina.
- Yes.

593
00:54:28.666 --> 00:54:30.458
- I'm sorry, Aunt Marlina.
- No.

594
00:54:31.583 --> 00:54:33.000
Marlina.

595
00:54:34.416 --> 00:54:35.666
My name is Karsidi.

596
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:37.750
You were the one who called my son?

597
00:54:37.833 --> 00:54:38.875
That's right.

598
00:54:38.958 --> 00:54:43.041
Do you know that Ryan and his friend
are looking for Ki Sangkut's ring?

599
00:54:43.125 --> 00:54:44.750
And it's very dangerous.

600
00:54:45.333 --> 00:54:47.541
Please find Ryan and Ben.

601
00:54:47.625 --> 00:54:49.750
The villagers and I will search.

602
00:54:49.833 --> 00:54:51.083
Excuse me.

603
00:54:52.166 --> 00:54:56.083
My pet demon is here.

604
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:02.375
Let's get up, Aunt Marlina.

605
00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:04.625
Easy, Aunt Marlina.

606
00:55:22.125 --> 00:55:23.583
Hang on, Aunt Marlina.

607
00:55:36.333 --> 00:55:38.000
I'm sorry, Aunt Marlina.

608
00:55:39.041 --> 00:55:41.625
I really didn't know.

609
00:55:41.708 --> 00:55:45.125
I didn't know it was going to be like this.

610
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.625
- Hurry, Ben.
- Come on.

611
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.666
Are you okay?

612
00:56:22.125 --> 00:56:23.375
Let me help you.

613
00:56:28.708 --> 00:56:29.791
Thank you.

614
00:56:53.833 --> 00:56:55.291
That's the call to prayer.

615
00:56:56.375 --> 00:56:58.000
You should go and pray.

616
00:56:58.583 --> 00:56:59.791
All right, Aunt Marlina.

617
00:58:24.791 --> 00:58:28.958
God is the greatest.

618
00:58:38.625 --> 00:58:40.250
Ben, the trace…

619
00:58:42.916 --> 00:58:43.916
Ben?

620
00:58:44.833 --> 00:58:46.375
Ben.

621
00:58:50.458 --> 00:58:51.583
Ben.

622
00:58:52.125 --> 00:58:54.041
Ben!

623
00:58:55.125 --> 00:58:56.375
Ben!

624
00:59:08.125 --> 00:59:09.583
Alana.

625
00:59:09.666 --> 00:59:11.291
- Alana.
- Elsa.

626
00:59:11.375 --> 00:59:12.833
Elsa, help me.

627
00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:15.083
Elsa, help me. My chest hurts.

628
00:59:16.041 --> 00:59:19.416
I'm feverish. Help.

629
00:59:21.875 --> 00:59:24.166
Alana.

630
00:59:26.625 --> 00:59:27.916
Alana.

631
00:59:28.583 --> 00:59:29.708
Alana.

632
00:59:32.833 --> 00:59:35.625
Alana.

633
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:44.041
I will not leave until this woman
hangs herself to death.

634
00:59:47.041 --> 00:59:48.541
Alana.

635
00:59:49.916 --> 00:59:52.000
Alana.

636
01:00:01.916 --> 01:00:05.833
Let me use your hands.
It hurts when I touch that bamboo.

637
01:00:05.958 --> 01:00:07.125
No!

638
01:00:08.916 --> 01:00:11.250
Pull them out one by one.

639
01:00:11.333 --> 01:00:12.875
No!

640
01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:25.875
Is your house still far?

641
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.541
You won't be able to leave this place.

642
01:00:57.291 --> 01:01:00.541
Grab that rock and hit your head with it!

643
01:01:14.833 --> 01:01:17.125
Hit it harder!

644
01:01:17.916 --> 01:01:18.958
Ben!

645
01:01:19.916 --> 01:01:20.916
Ben.

646
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.750
Don't be like this!
What are you doing, Ben?

647
01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:27.208
Hit him!

648
01:01:27.791 --> 01:01:30.250
Ben!

649
01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:41.083
- Hit him!
- In the name of Allah,

650
01:01:41.166 --> 01:01:43.958
- the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
- Hit him!

651
01:01:56.708 --> 01:01:57.833
Ben.

652
01:02:00.541 --> 01:02:01.916
Ben.

653
01:02:02.541 --> 01:02:04.166
Ben, wake up.

654
01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:09.625
I'm sorry, Ryan.

655
01:02:10.166 --> 01:02:12.416
I really didn't know.

656
01:02:13.208 --> 01:02:14.750
It's okay, Ben.

657
01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:17.875
You were under the influence
of that demon.

658
01:02:18.708 --> 01:02:20.250
I understand.

659
01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:26.125
Mr. Karsidi.

660
01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:29.125
Your mother asked me
and some of the villagers

661
01:02:29.208 --> 01:02:30.500
to look for you.

662
01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:32.333
Well?

663
01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:35.458
Did you get the ring from Ki Sangkut?

664
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.958
- Yes.
- Can I see it?

665
01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:39.041
Sure.

666
01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:47.208
Yes, he got it.

667
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.708
All right, then. I'm going to see Alana.

668
01:02:51.791 --> 01:02:52.666
Sure.

669
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:53.916
Ben.

670
01:02:58.791 --> 01:03:00.291
What is going on here?

671
01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:01.708
Hold him!

672
01:03:05.583 --> 01:03:07.208
Don't try anything stupid.

673
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:11.208
You're coming with me,
or I'm going to kill your friend.

674
01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:15.166
Sir, please. I'm running out of time.
I have to see Alana.

675
01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:17.750
Ben!

676
01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:22.500
Come with me.

677
01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:25.250
I will not hesitate to kill you.

678
01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:26.583
Move.

679
01:03:27.416 --> 01:03:28.916
Keep going.

680
01:03:35.833 --> 01:03:38.208
It must be excruciating for you, Alana.

681
01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:43.625
You have to survive.

682
01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:48.166
That demon can't keep
putting you in misery.

683
01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.041
35 SUICIDES IN KIDUL TO DATE

684
01:03:59.166 --> 01:04:02.583
<i>Pulung gantung</i> is a spirit

685
01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:05.708
with virtually endless power.

686
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.333
No one knows how to stop it.

687
01:04:12.708 --> 01:04:14.916
However, there's an assumption…

688
01:04:15.666 --> 01:04:20.250
that the one who can stop <i>pulung gantung</i>
is the one who started it.

689
01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:30.541
Get in.

690
01:04:33.125 --> 01:04:35.166
- Get inside!
- No.

691
01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:52.125
Dad.

692
01:04:57.333 --> 01:04:58.708
This is…

693
01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:02.750
the only keepsake that I have.

694
01:05:07.166 --> 01:05:10.291
Ten years… is a long time.

695
01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:13.708
Now…

696
01:05:14.583 --> 01:05:15.958
you're all grown up, son.

697
01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:27.833
What's wrong? Are you confused?

698
01:05:27.916 --> 01:05:28.958
Is that so?

699
01:05:31.166 --> 01:05:32.750
So, whose grave is that?

700
01:05:35.208 --> 01:05:37.666
No one's.

701
01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:40.666
It's an empty grave.

702
01:05:41.291 --> 01:05:44.291
Make sure they do it well.

703
01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:48.000
- After that, you call…
<i>- Your father passed away.</i>

704
01:05:48.083 --> 01:05:50.708
After you call, turn off the phone.

705
01:05:50.791 --> 01:05:53.750
Can you… come here?

706
01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:57.791
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, sir?</i>

707
01:05:59.666 --> 01:06:01.375
Give him the location.

708
01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:04.208
That's it. Done. Don't forget.

709
01:06:10.958 --> 01:06:11.958
Where is it?

710
01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:15.666
Did you get Ki Sangkut's ring?

711
01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:18.750
Ryan.

712
01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:22.000
Give the ring to your father.

713
01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:23.375
Where is the ring?

714
01:06:31.666 --> 01:06:33.916
Ryan.

715
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.375
Hey.

716
01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:41.208
This is the ring that can save
the Kidul villagers…

717
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.833
from the curse of <i>pulung gantung.</i>

718
01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.291
With this ring,

719
01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:52.041
I have to stop the misery
and the suffering of the villagers.

720
01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:53.125
Honey.

721
01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:54.666
Let's go.

722
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:56.375
Why are you just sitting there?

723
01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:59.166
Marlina. I told you.

724
01:06:59.666 --> 01:07:01.291
That's sacred land.

725
01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:04.083
We can't plant anything there.

726
01:07:04.166 --> 01:07:06.708
- We can get into trouble.
- Like I care.

727
01:07:06.791 --> 01:07:10.250
You have to stop believing
in superstition.

728
01:07:10.333 --> 01:07:12.125
That land was given to us.

729
01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:17.916
Don't you remember? We've had
zero income in the last three months.

730
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.208
Think about your son.

731
01:07:19.291 --> 01:07:21.500
The whole village could be in trouble.

732
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.583
Look.

733
01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:26.833
What did I say?

734
01:07:26.916 --> 01:07:28.625
It really happened, right?

735
01:07:28.708 --> 01:07:30.375
It's all because of you.

736
01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:33.333
It's just superstition.

737
01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:35.000
You are so stubborn.

738
01:07:45.666 --> 01:07:47.958
Wait, you go ahead.

739
01:07:48.041 --> 01:07:49.083
I forgot something.

740
01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.458
Take Ryan with you.

741
01:07:50.541 --> 01:07:51.833
Let's go.

742
01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:53.875
Prasetyo!

743
01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:58.000
Prasetyo!

744
01:07:58.083 --> 01:08:00.208
Prasetyo!

745
01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:02.208
- Get out!
- What's going on?

746
01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:05.000
- Come out here.
- What is it?

747
01:08:05.083 --> 01:08:08.583
I told you, right? That's sacred land.

748
01:08:08.666 --> 01:08:10.916
Sacred land. It's not for planting crops.

749
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.250
I inherited that land.
What's wrong with that?

750
01:08:13.333 --> 01:08:17.625
You're so stubborn. Because of you,
a lot of villagers were possessed.

751
01:08:17.708 --> 01:08:19.291
Do you understand?

752
01:08:19.375 --> 01:08:21.416
That's not my problem.

753
01:08:29.791 --> 01:08:31.666
Marlina, help.

754
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.750
Marlina.

755
01:08:35.458 --> 01:08:36.541
Marlina.

756
01:08:36.625 --> 01:08:38.458
Everyone, stop!

757
01:08:38.541 --> 01:08:40.083
Leave now!

758
01:08:40.166 --> 01:08:42.875
Let me handle it.

759
01:08:43.458 --> 01:08:47.500
Prasetyo, and all of you…

760
01:08:47.583 --> 01:08:50.541
have known me long enough, right?

761
01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:51.625
Yes, Ki Sangkut.

762
01:08:51.708 --> 01:08:55.583
I can stop <i>pulung gantung</i>

763
01:08:55.666 --> 01:08:58.125
with my sacred ring.

764
01:08:58.208 --> 01:09:01.666
Ki Sangkut kept his word.

765
01:09:02.458 --> 01:09:03.916
The curse stopped.

766
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.416
Unfortunately, Ki Sangkut died.

767
01:09:11.583 --> 01:09:13.791
The ring was buried along with him.

768
01:09:17.541 --> 01:09:18.833
And…

769
01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:22.166
<i>pulung gantung</i>
has been running amok since.

770
01:09:27.166 --> 01:09:30.916
I tried digging up his grave.
But I always failed.

771
01:09:36.791 --> 01:09:38.583
Only someone

772
01:09:38.666 --> 01:09:41.333
born on a Kliwon on the 23rd
in the month of Suro

773
01:09:41.416 --> 01:09:43.625
is able to dig up the grave of Ki Sangkut.

774
01:09:44.708 --> 01:09:46.458
And that person is you.

775
01:09:50.208 --> 01:09:51.791
So all of this was bait?

776
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.416
Is that it?

777
01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.708
Because I was the chosen one?

778
01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:56.791
Yes!

779
01:09:57.916 --> 01:09:59.958
If I had told you…

780
01:10:01.333 --> 01:10:05.333
that I wanted to see you,
your mother wouldn't have allowed it.

781
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:09.250
But, yeah…

782
01:10:13.166 --> 01:10:16.375
Dad, I need that ring. Now.

783
01:10:16.458 --> 01:10:18.791
This ring is going to stay on my hand.

784
01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:22.250
Please understand my situation.

785
01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:26.958
- She's my girlfriend.
- You're the one who should understand.

786
01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:30.500
This ring stays here.

787
01:10:34.375 --> 01:10:36.041
Ryan.

788
01:10:36.125 --> 01:10:37.625
Damn it.

789
01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:41.291
Ryan!

790
01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:44.291
- Elsa.
- Ben.

791
01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.291
Where is Ryan?

792
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:49.958
I don't know, Elsa.

793
01:10:50.041 --> 01:10:51.791
You're unbelievable, Ben.

794
01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:54.458
Don't you get it?

795
01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:57.583
Alana's fate depends on that ring, Ben.

796
01:10:57.666 --> 01:10:59.916
Do you think it was easy to get that ring?

797
01:11:00.416 --> 01:11:02.791
While you were enjoying yourself here,
Ryan and I…

798
01:11:02.875 --> 01:11:05.291
Ryan and I had to face scary ghosts,

799
01:11:05.375 --> 01:11:07.041
I was beaten badly.

800
01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:09.708
Me, enjoying myself?

801
01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:10.958
I…

802
01:11:11.041 --> 01:11:14.166
I almost killed Ryan's mom, Ben.

803
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.416
Are you insane?

804
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.625
- Luckily, Mr. Karsidi was here.
- Ben.

805
01:11:24.625 --> 01:11:25.958
Where's Ryan?

806
01:11:26.791 --> 01:11:28.166
Did you get the ring?

807
01:11:34.583 --> 01:11:35.666
Oh, God.

808
01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:37.791
Oh, God.

809
01:11:39.625 --> 01:11:42.666
Look where you're going!
Don't you have eyes?

810
01:11:46.458 --> 01:11:49.375
- I'm sorry.
- How dare you! Don't leave me like this!

811
01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:10.583
<i>When night falls,</i>

812
01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:15.083
the barrier can no longer be used.

813
01:13:17.916 --> 01:13:19.333
Alana.

814
01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:21.750
Stop, you evil thing!

815
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.583
Show me what you've got!

816
01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:42.916
Alana!

817
01:13:44.291 --> 01:13:45.916
Alana!

818
01:13:57.333 --> 01:13:59.333
Don't kill my friend!

819
01:13:59.416 --> 01:14:01.250
Alana!

820
01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:03.875
- Don't kill my friend!
- Alana.

821
01:14:03.958 --> 01:14:06.166
Alana!

822
01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:08.458
- Get down, Alana!
- Alana!

823
01:14:09.958 --> 01:14:11.916
Alana.

824
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Alana.

825
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.958
Alana.

826
01:14:28.708 --> 01:14:30.000
Get back.

827
01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:34.750
Alana, wake up.

828
01:14:35.666 --> 01:14:37.166
Wake up, Alana.

829
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:38.875
Wake up!

830
01:15:34.583 --> 01:15:36.750
- Mom.
- Aunt Marlina.

831
01:15:39.583 --> 01:15:41.458
Aunt Marlina.

832
01:15:46.958 --> 01:15:48.833
The soul of your friend…

833
01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:55.083
is held up in the supernatural realm
where <i>pulung gantung</i> rules.

834
01:16:30.916 --> 01:16:34.666
Put Ki Sangkut's ring on her finger.

835
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:38.875
Remember…

836
01:16:40.458 --> 01:16:43.416
she only has two hours.

837
01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:49.666
- Aunt Marlina.
- Mom.

838
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:51.208
- Aunt Marlina.
- Mom.

839
01:16:51.291 --> 01:16:52.875
- Mom.
- Aunt Marlina.

840
01:16:55.333 --> 01:16:56.375
Alana.

841
01:16:57.083 --> 01:16:58.583
- Hurry, Ryan.
- Yes.

842
01:17:06.833 --> 01:17:08.125
Yes.

843
01:17:08.208 --> 01:17:09.708
It's me, Marlina.

844
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.208
You.

845
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:14.875
Return the ring!

846
01:17:15.916 --> 01:17:16.875
Shut up!

847
01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:21.083
Did your son tell you everything?

848
01:17:21.166 --> 01:17:22.541
Yes.

849
01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:25.916
And you managed
to lure Ryan into coming here.

850
01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:28.416
You started it.

851
01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.166
You caused everything.

852
01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:31.083
Traitor!

853
01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:34.833
And whatever happens,
I would sacrifice my life for my son.

854
01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:36.375
Give me the ring!

855
01:17:36.916 --> 01:17:37.875
Dad.

856
01:17:38.666 --> 01:17:41.583
Alana still has a chance to live.

857
01:17:41.666 --> 01:17:44.583
So, please. Give us the ring back.

858
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:52.166
- Shut up!
- Prasetyo!

859
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.083
Chase him, Ryan!

860
01:18:01.166 --> 01:18:02.958
Dad!

861
01:18:07.708 --> 01:18:08.666
Well?

862
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:11.333
- Are we going to the south forest?
- Yes.

863
01:18:11.416 --> 01:18:14.208
We have to stop <i>pulung gantung.</i>

864
01:18:14.291 --> 01:18:17.916
And what are you going to do
with that ring?

865
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.583
I won't waste it.

866
01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:23.541
This sacred ring of Ki Sangkut

867
01:18:24.416 --> 01:18:30.666
can control spirits, ghosts and demons.

868
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:33.166
And I'll be as powerful as Ki Sangkut.

869
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:35.125
Do you know the consequences?

870
01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:38.958
You don't need to teach me, Karsidi.
I know.

871
01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:42.583
They're not here, Ben.

872
01:18:42.708 --> 01:18:44.500
Where did he go?

873
01:18:47.083 --> 01:18:49.750
Apparently, my son doesn't easily give up.

874
01:18:51.166 --> 01:18:52.333
Let's go now.

875
01:18:53.041 --> 01:18:54.583
Hang on a second.

876
01:18:54.666 --> 01:18:58.375
I'm going to call upon
those who are lifeless.

877
01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:24.958
Okay. Let's just go back.

878
01:19:28.666 --> 01:19:29.541
That…

879
01:19:31.541 --> 01:19:33.125
Damn it!

880
01:19:36.083 --> 01:19:37.375
- Ryan!
- Ben!

881
01:19:37.458 --> 01:19:39.583
Let's just go!

882
01:19:39.666 --> 01:19:41.250
Help!

883
01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.250
Dad, please.

884
01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:57.416
Alana's life is still in danger.

885
01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:00.291
Please, Uncle. Lend the ring to us.

886
01:20:00.375 --> 01:20:03.625
We'll save Alana's life.
And we'll return the ring back to you.

887
01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:09.375
Once you put it on,
you may never take it off.

888
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:13.916
Do not interfere!

889
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.875
Damn you!

890
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.083
Let go of it!

891
01:20:27.916 --> 01:20:29.958
Let go of the ring, you old man!

892
01:20:33.916 --> 01:20:35.000
I'm sorry, Dad.

893
01:20:35.083 --> 01:20:36.625
Let's go back.

894
01:20:39.541 --> 01:20:40.875
Let's go, Ben!

895
01:20:40.958 --> 01:20:42.250
Hurry!

896
01:20:42.333 --> 01:20:45.250
Ryan!

897
01:20:47.625 --> 01:20:49.041
You have to come back.

898
01:20:50.125 --> 01:20:54.208
You… have to come back, Alana.

899
01:20:54.791 --> 01:20:56.083
Elsa.

900
01:20:56.166 --> 01:20:58.958
Elsa, where are you?

901
01:21:06.708 --> 01:21:08.166
Please.

902
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:09.541
Come back, Alana.

903
01:21:11.458 --> 01:21:13.291
Mom, this is the ring.

904
01:21:13.375 --> 01:21:15.125
The ring.

905
01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:30.125
Alana.

906
01:21:31.166 --> 01:21:32.916
Alana, wake up.

907
01:21:34.333 --> 01:21:36.791
Wake up, Alana.

908
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.791
Alana, wake up.

909
01:21:39.875 --> 01:21:40.958
Alana.

910
01:21:45.583 --> 01:21:48.625
Wake up, Alana. Wake up.

911
01:21:49.333 --> 01:21:51.541
Indeed, we belong to Allah…

912
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:54.875
and indeed, to Him we return.

913
01:21:55.666 --> 01:21:57.291
Wake up, Alana.

914
01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.750
Alana, wake up.

915
01:22:05.083 --> 01:22:06.208
Alana.

916
01:22:06.875 --> 01:22:08.250
Are you okay?

917
01:22:09.916 --> 01:22:12.041
Ryan.

918
01:22:12.125 --> 01:22:15.125
Thank God.

919
01:22:15.208 --> 01:22:16.416
Thank God.

920
01:22:18.083 --> 01:22:19.416
Ryan!

921
01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.541
Give me the ring. Now.

922
01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:29.333
Not in your wildest dreams.

923
01:22:30.916 --> 01:22:33.500
Yes, you were friends with Ki Sangkut,

924
01:22:34.208 --> 01:22:38.083
but you can never be
as powerful as he was.

925
01:22:38.166 --> 01:22:39.375
Marlina.

926
01:22:40.541 --> 01:22:42.958
You made me who I am now.

927
01:22:45.583 --> 01:22:49.291
Yes, I'm selfish,
but I'm not as stupid as you.

928
01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:52.833
- Damn you!
- Aunt Marlina!

929
01:23:56.666 --> 01:23:57.875
Ben.

930
01:23:59.125 --> 01:24:00.125
Pull over.

931
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:32.958
Do not kill yourselves.

932
01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:37.208
Allah is, without a doubt,
most merciful to you.

933
01:24:37.291 --> 01:24:38.708
But, sir.

934
01:24:38.791 --> 01:24:40.583
People in Kidul Village

935
01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:43.416
commit suicide after being possessed
by <i>pulung gantung.</i>

936
01:24:44.541 --> 01:24:46.291
What do you have to say about them?

937
01:24:46.375 --> 01:24:49.666
Suicide is a very big sin.

938
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:53.458
It's only done by people with weak faith.

939
01:24:53.541 --> 01:24:59.291
It's so easy for the devil to take them
down the wrong path.

940
01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:03.208
Ryan, just accept it.

941
01:25:03.291 --> 01:25:04.833
Accept your father's death.

942
01:25:05.416 --> 01:25:06.458
Let it go.

943
01:25:08.375 --> 01:25:09.833
Peace be upon you, Mom.

944
01:26:26.083 --> 01:26:29.500
WHOEVER KILLS HIMSELF
IN A WAY THAT EXISTS IN THIS WORLD,

945
01:26:29.583 --> 01:26:31.500
SURELY ON THE DAY OF RESURRECTION

946
01:26:31.583 --> 01:26:35.125
ALLAH WILL TORTURE HIM IN THE SAME WAY.

947
01:26:35.208 --> 01:26:37.291
HADITH BY BUKHARI AND MUSLIM

948
01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:04.000
Uncle, I found this.
