00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:31.000
I seek refuge in Allah
from the accursed Satan.

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:35.166
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.458
Say, O Prophet,
"I seek refuge in the Lord of humankind,

00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:40.458
the Master of humankind,

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.791
the God of humankind,

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.833
from the evil of the lurking whisperer

00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:51.250
who whispers into the hearts of humankind

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.958
from among jinn and humankind."

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:59.083
Take your pills later, okay?

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.958
These pills won't make me better.

00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:07.833
I'm cold.

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:11.125
-I'm cold. I can't take it.
-Mom.

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:11.916
Mom.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.416
-I'll rub some oil on you.
-Mom.

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:18.375
I can't take this anymore, honey.
It's happening every night.

00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:20.125
Someone must have cursed me.

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:21.541
What is it?

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:22.750
Mom…

00:01:28.708 --> 00:01:31.666
-Mom.
-Honey.

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:35.750
Honey, are you all right?

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:38.083
Honey?

00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:43.041
Honey!

00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:45.916
Honey! Oh God!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.125
Honey.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.250
Honey.

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:54.708
Honey?

00:01:55.541 --> 00:01:57.500
No, don't!

00:01:57.916 --> 00:02:00.708
-Honey! Don't!
-Mom!

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:02.375
Honey!

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:04.083
No! Honey!

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:09.833
-Honey!
-Mom.

00:02:09.916 --> 00:02:11.416
-Honey.
-It hurts!

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.833
-Honey!
-Mom, it hurts!

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:15.916
-It hurts!
-Let go of her!

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:22.625
Come on, Yul, get inside.

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:30.625
Yuli.

00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:31.833
Wait here, okay?

00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:35.416
I'll come back
after I take care of your mom, okay?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.458
-Oh my God. Honey?
-It hurts.

00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:46.708
-It hurts.
-It hurts!

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:47.875
No!

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:50.625
I'd rather die!

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:52.458
-No, stay strong!
-Please, it hurts.

00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.333
Honey, what are you doing? No!

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:56.625
Honey!

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:09.125
Dad?

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:11.500
Dad? Mom?

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:18.583
Dad?

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.708
WEST JAVA CITY PATROL

00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:55.875
Little girl.

00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.333
Wake up, dear.

00:03:57.916 --> 00:04:00.250
Careful.

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:02.000
Watch your step.

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:05.041
Come on.

00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:15.875
Dad? Mom?

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.458
Mom?

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:21.958
Mom!

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:24.958
-You cannot come in.
-That's my husband.

00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:28.083
Mom! Dad!

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:30.458
-Honey!
-Dad!

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:32.125
-Calm down.
-Mom.

00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:36.208
-Dad.
-It's all right. Calm down.

00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:37.791
Mom.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.375
You bastard child.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:21.500
20 YEARS LATER

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:27.708
You just finished cooking, Yuli?

00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:31.000
Look at the time.
What have you been doing?

00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:32.625
The rice, Yuli!

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.375
Yes, just a minute.

00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:41.041
-Where to, Ka?
-To the mosque.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.125
I'll see you later.

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:47.416
Why do you go to the mosque every day?
Grandma's sick, you know.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.000
Don't you want to stay at home?

00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:51.875
But I already promised Abuyya.

00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.333
Yuli? Tika, help her.

00:05:57.583 --> 00:05:58.750
Ma'am.

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:00.458
Ma'am.

00:06:00.541 --> 00:06:03.083
Yuli, where's the sauce?

00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:04.875
I'll make it right after this.

00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.166
You know my husband
can't eat without chili.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.375
It's too hot.

00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:10.291
Have you showered?

00:06:16.583 --> 00:06:17.875
It's still hot, idiot!

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:20.333
I'm sorry.

00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:21.708
Tika?

00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:22.875
Take care.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.875
Auntie, Grandma doesn't like it.

00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:29.916
Have a drink, ma'am.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.291
Grandma, I have to go.

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:38.375
Dean, take care of Grandma, okay?

00:06:38.458 --> 00:06:41.541
Dean, you haven't changed your clothes?

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:44.375
Come and give me a kiss.

00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:47.166
You smell. Go change.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.291
Tika!

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:49.583
Let's go.

00:06:49.666 --> 00:06:51.958
-Have you been waiting long?
-No, I'm good.

00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:53.625
-You sure?
-Yes.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:05.833
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful…

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:19.750
In the Quran, Surah Al-Mutaffifin,

00:07:19.833 --> 00:07:22.291
Allah SWT said,

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:28.250
"Kallâ inna kitaâbal-fujjari lafî sijjîn."

00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:35.083
That every disobedient act
is recorded in the Sijjin.

00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:37.708
Wa mâ adrâka mâ sijjîn.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.166
What is Sijjin?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.875
It goes on to say,

00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.833
Kitâbum marqûm.

00:07:42.916 --> 00:07:48.750
A book that records every act
of our evil deeds.

00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:53.375
But if it is for pious deeds,
our good deeds,

00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:58.500
these will be recorded by the angels
in the book called Illiyyin.

00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:00.875
Look at that.

00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.083
The house has been empty for a long time.

00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:05.416
Yeah, it's really dark.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.458
Who used to live there?

00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:12.208
-There's a ghost!
-What?

00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:23.958
O spirits,

00:08:25.583 --> 00:08:27.500
I have with me some offerings.

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:31.333
Come and tell me.

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:38.458
Come and tell me.

00:08:40.416 --> 00:08:42.041
Come and tell me.

00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:45.583
Come and tell me.

00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:17.666
Good evening.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.291
Dean, I already told you
not to play with that.

00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:25.083
My friend said that if we use this,
we can talk to the dead.

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:28.625
How can you even talk to a dead person?

00:09:29.541 --> 00:09:31.750
What's wrong with Grandma?

00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:33.000
Gosh.

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:34.458
I'll get more pillows, okay?

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.458
Lift your head.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.208
Like that.

00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:42.000
Aunt Yuli, do you want to try
talking to dead people too?

00:09:46.875 --> 00:09:48.583
I wanted to at one time.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.708
Every time I missed
my late father and mother.

00:09:55.541 --> 00:09:56.750
Grandma?

00:09:57.416 --> 00:09:58.416
What is it?

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.583
Please get some oxygen.

00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:02.666
What's wrong with Grandma?

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.125
-Aunt Yuli, can I leave her with you?
-Yes.

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:05.166
-I'll go and get Mom.
-Okay.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.458
Tika, hurry up!

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.916
Your parents

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.333
deserved to die!

00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:23.875
Mom?

00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.708
-Mom?
-Tika, help me.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:28.416
-Lift her up.
-Okay, we'll do that.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.083
-Inhaler.
-Inhaler?

00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:31.875
-Inhaler or pills?
-Inhaler.

00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:36.791
-Grandma.
-Mom?

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:38.750
-Grandma?
-Mom?

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:40.250
-Grandma?
-Mom? Mom.

00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:42.208
What's wrong, Mom?

00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:43.958
Grandma…

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:47.875
Oh no.

00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.250
Mom…

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.625
Grandma?

00:10:55.416 --> 00:10:56.416
Wake up, Mom.

00:10:57.333 --> 00:10:59.500
-Mom?
-She's gone.

00:10:59.583 --> 00:11:01.791
-She's gone.
-Grandma…

00:11:01.875 --> 00:11:03.541
-Mom.
-Grandma.

00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:06.625
-Grandma.
-Mom, wake up.

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.166
Grandma.

00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:10.583
-Mom.
-Grandma.

00:11:10.666 --> 00:11:14.000
-Grandma. Grandma!
-Mom!

00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:15.708
AMBARWATI
DAUGHTER OF SURYONO

00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:18.666
Peace be upon you.

00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:23.166
Tika, my condolences.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.416
Indeed, we belong to Allah, and to Him
we shall return. Stay strong.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.750
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you too.

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:28.833
Hello.

00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:56.125
Those who are not family,
please leave the room.

00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:09.208
What are you doing here?

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.375
Get out.

00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:16.583
Prepare the shroud for my mother.

00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:22.250
Yes, take that one.

00:12:33.375 --> 00:12:36.708
Before we pray for her
and have her funeral,

00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:38.833
if anyone wants to kiss her goodbye,

00:12:38.916 --> 00:12:40.833
don't let your tears fall, okay?

00:13:21.708 --> 00:13:23.291
Idiot!

00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:25.333
Eat it.

00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:27.166
Eat it!

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.041
-Idiot!
-I'm sorry, ma'am!

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:31.791
I've fed you, you bastard!

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.208
-Eat it!
-No.

00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:38.416
-Here.
-No, ma'am, please!

00:13:41.125 --> 00:13:42.666
I'm sorry.

00:13:44.208 --> 00:13:45.583
Sorry for what?

00:13:49.416 --> 00:13:52.083
You're already dead.
You're already dead.

00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:54.166
Die, you!

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.333
Yuli.

00:14:00.416 --> 00:14:01.375
Yuli!

00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.625
Oh God!

00:14:03.708 --> 00:14:05.625
You're happy that my mother died, right?

00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:09.083
My mother has been taking care of you
since you were little,

00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:11.708
and now you're making a scene
in front of her.

00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:14.291
You're so ungrateful, Yuli.

00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:15.875
Bastard child!

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.708
Ms. Laras, please calm down.

00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:20.000
We shouldn't do this
in front of the deceased.

00:14:21.083 --> 00:14:23.083
Take her.

00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:24.750
-Gosh.
-Mom.

00:14:24.833 --> 00:14:26.833
Mom, let's go.

00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:47.833
Mom, why isn't Dad coming home?

00:14:48.666 --> 00:14:49.875
Let's go inside.

00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:53.250
No, I'm waiting for Dad.

00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:54.958
Where did he go, Mom?

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.416
Yes.

00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:45.041
Yuli is the child of an affair.

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:48.500
Look, she doesn't even
look like Mrs. Laras.

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:51.750
You're right, she looks different.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.583
Rudi, not there.

00:15:55.666 --> 00:15:57.833
That's not where you put it.

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.541
That's not it.

00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:02.666
It's been two months
and you still don't get it.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.333
Over there.

00:16:04.416 --> 00:16:07.333
They're all placed over there.

00:16:07.416 --> 00:16:10.833
-You said on the shelf.
-No, here.

00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:12.750
-Okay, okay.
-Gosh.

00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:15.958
-Right here?
-Yes.

00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:19.250
-For you.
-Okay.

00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:21.583
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.708
Bye.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.500
Don't take that.

00:16:26.583 --> 00:16:29.708
We need to give everything to Laras.

00:16:29.791 --> 00:16:31.000
Yuli?

00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:34.000
What is this?

00:16:35.125 --> 00:16:37.875
Is what my mother gave you
still not enough?

00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:41.041
-No, Yono was just…
-I can't believe you.

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:42.791
When will it be enough for you?

00:16:42.875 --> 00:16:45.750
-I was going to give it to you.
-Why did Yono give you money?

00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:47.750
What did you do with Yono?

00:16:47.833 --> 00:16:49.208
Nothing.

00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:51.541
-What did you and Yono do?
-Nothing, this is…

00:16:51.625 --> 00:16:54.458
You slut, you're just like your mother!

00:17:00.916 --> 00:17:02.833
What? What do you want?

00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:05.000
You're gonna talk back to me now?

00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:06.625
Just because my mother
is no longer around,

00:17:06.708 --> 00:17:08.750
you think you can fight me, is that so?

00:17:09.583 --> 00:17:12.250
I don't care that I'm yelling!
It's so everyone will know who she is.

00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:13.958
That's enough.

00:17:14.041 --> 00:17:15.500
You should go.

00:17:16.375 --> 00:17:17.833
Hello, ma'am.

00:17:17.916 --> 00:17:19.958
-What do you need?
-Sugar.

00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:21.541
Sugar?

00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:22.875
Rudi!

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.208
Wait a minute, please.

00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:34.875
You should eat, Yuli.

00:17:36.375 --> 00:17:37.375
Okay.

00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:42.666
Yono.

00:17:44.833 --> 00:17:46.208
Help me, please.

00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:13.833
You wait here.

00:18:13.916 --> 00:18:15.083
I'll go alone.

00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:40.666
Excuse me.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.791
Abah?

00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:52.916
Miss Yuli?

00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:54.583
Come in.

00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:10.583
I want to destroy this family

00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:13.458
just like they destroyed my life.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.083
What about the one before this?

00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:17.166
Is she dead?

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.208
Do you want them blind, disabled,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.833
or dead?

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:28.458
I want them all…

00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:34.041
dead.

00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:37.666
Are you ready for the risk?

00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:10.875
My eyes are in the universe.

00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:14.708
My spirit is in the unseen realm.

00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:19.791
I ask forgiveness from all beings.

00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:23.916
I ask for guidance
from those who dwell there.

00:20:42.583 --> 00:20:46.708
There is one black magic curse
that can make your wishes come true.

00:20:46.791 --> 00:20:50.000
It is very dangerous and deadly.

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:53.333
The ritual requires a fresh corpse

00:20:53.416 --> 00:20:55.291
which isn't 40 days old yet.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.125
What if…

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.166
the corpse is from the same family, Bah?

00:21:03.333 --> 00:21:04.375
That's even better.

00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:29.041
-Wait, wait. So heavy.
-One, two, three.

00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:32.583
-Again.
-Two, three.

00:22:35.708 --> 00:22:38.541
-Come on.
-Come on. Two, three.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.166
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

00:23:21.958 --> 00:23:23.500
Yono, come on.

00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:26.625
Come on.

00:23:29.375 --> 00:23:31.333
Wait, wait.

00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:33.166
One, two, three.

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:56.000
Wait outside.

00:23:56.083 --> 00:23:56.916
Okay.

00:25:25.916 --> 00:25:28.625
AMBARWATI DAUGHTER OF SURYONO
BORN 20 FEBRUARY 1943

00:26:05.958 --> 00:26:07.666
Blood meets blood.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.750
Blood meets blood.

00:26:09.833 --> 00:26:11.208
Skin meets skin.

00:26:11.291 --> 00:26:13.083
Skin meets skin.

00:26:13.166 --> 00:26:14.791
Flesh meets flesh.

00:26:14.875 --> 00:26:16.541
Flesh meets flesh.

00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:18.541
Breech blocked by breech.

00:26:18.625 --> 00:26:21.000
Breech blocked by breech.

00:26:21.083 --> 00:26:22.458
Black sky, black earth.

00:26:22.541 --> 00:26:25.083
Black sky, black earth.

00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:29.083
I am controlled by my ancestors.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.708
I am controlled…

00:26:42.541 --> 00:26:44.791
I am controlled by my ancestors.

00:26:45.833 --> 00:26:49.208
All shall be destroyed before me.

00:26:51.208 --> 00:26:54.375
Destroyed, destroyed, destroyed.

00:26:55.083 --> 00:26:58.583
I call upon the Queen of Black Magic
in the high mountains.

00:26:59.125 --> 00:27:02.125
I know the Queen always desires something.

00:27:02.208 --> 00:27:04.250
I have brought her favorite offering.

00:27:04.333 --> 00:27:05.500
Accept my command.

00:27:05.583 --> 00:27:08.041
Destroy them all.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.875
Their deaths are on you.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:46.291
You have to finish everything
before this corpse rots.

00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:51.166
You must perform this ritual
until it is completed.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.416
If you don't,

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.208
all the black magic will come back to you.

00:27:58.416 --> 00:28:04.041
The jinn really like sinful
and misguided people.

00:28:05.625 --> 00:28:10.416
Make sure those people are sinners
and that they deserve to die.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.125
Allah is the Greatest.

00:28:22.416 --> 00:28:24.583
Allah is the Greatest.

00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:33.958
Glory be to my Lord, the Most High,
and praise be to Him.

00:28:35.083 --> 00:28:38.208
Glory be to my Lord, the Most High,
and praise be to Him.

00:28:38.916 --> 00:28:40.916
Allah hears the one who praises Him.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.708
Lord, to You belongs all praise, as much
as would fill the heavens and the earth.

00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:46.041
Allah is the Greatest.

00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:47.958
Glory be to my Lord, the Most High…

00:28:48.708 --> 00:28:51.833
Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, and
praise be to Him. Allah is the Greatest.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.750
My Lord, forgive me,
have mercy on me, heal me,

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:57.375
raise me, provide for me, guide me,
grant me health, and pardon me.

00:28:57.458 --> 00:28:59.583
Allah is the Greatest.

00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:03.750
Glory be to my Lord, the Most High,
and praise be to Him.

00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:06.333
Allah is the Greatest.

00:29:07.875 --> 00:29:10.500
All greetings, prayers,
and good things are for Allah…

00:31:20.125 --> 00:31:21.791
What's the matter?

00:31:22.666 --> 00:31:24.500
I saw Grandma over there.

00:31:25.041 --> 00:31:27.750
On the bed! She really was there!

00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:29.916
You're just imagining things.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.083
Go to sleep. It's late.

00:31:45.208 --> 00:31:47.958
You should have been more careful, Tika.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.375
I think something's really wrong, Mom.

00:31:51.458 --> 00:31:54.375
How could the photo fall on its own?

00:31:54.458 --> 00:31:55.708
It's weird.

00:31:56.541 --> 00:31:58.083
What if it's Grandma?

00:31:59.416 --> 00:32:02.375
Yesterday, I tried to talk to Grandma.

00:32:02.458 --> 00:32:04.000
Then she answered.

00:32:04.625 --> 00:32:06.000
Grandma said…

00:32:06.666 --> 00:32:07.916
"It hurts."

00:32:09.541 --> 00:32:11.583
Don't say that, okay?

00:32:11.666 --> 00:32:13.416
Why are you still playing that?

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.958
I'm serious.

00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:17.291
What if she is really in pain?

00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:24.250
Mom, tonight, we're doing
the prayers for Grandma, right?

00:32:26.916 --> 00:32:29.166
What's the point of those prayers, Tika?

00:32:29.791 --> 00:32:31.375
You said so yourself.

00:32:31.458 --> 00:32:32.875
Grandma has passed away.

00:32:32.958 --> 00:32:35.291
People should be praying for us.

00:32:36.333 --> 00:32:37.500
So we can stay strong.

00:32:37.583 --> 00:32:41.500
Yes, but there's nothing wrong
with praying for Grandma too, right, Mom?

00:32:41.583 --> 00:32:44.833
So she can rest easy there too, okay?

00:32:46.333 --> 00:32:48.083
You handle it.

00:32:53.375 --> 00:32:54.750
Yuli.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.708
I've been calling for you for a while.

00:33:01.166 --> 00:33:02.250
Look at that.

00:33:02.333 --> 00:33:04.541
Do I have to sort it all out myself?

00:33:06.583 --> 00:33:09.291
For the prayers tonight,
if you need anything,

00:33:09.958 --> 00:33:11.125
just tell Aunt Yuli.

00:33:11.208 --> 00:33:12.333
Let her take care of it.

00:33:12.416 --> 00:33:13.291
Okay.

00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:14.958
But I can't today.

00:33:15.041 --> 00:33:16.291
Where are you going?

00:33:17.458 --> 00:33:19.833
-Aren't you going to the shop?
-I have things to do.

00:33:19.916 --> 00:33:21.291
What's wrong with you, Yuli?

00:33:21.375 --> 00:33:23.416
You don't want to work.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.125
You don't want to take care
of the prayers.

00:33:25.208 --> 00:33:28.708
You've really been acting up
since my mother passed away.

00:33:29.625 --> 00:33:30.833
Yuli.

00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:34.291
-There she goes again!
-Mom, it's okay.

00:33:34.375 --> 00:33:37.416
It's fine, I'll handle everything.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.916
I'm going to the mosque.

00:33:40.916 --> 00:33:42.541
I'll see you later, Rudi.

00:33:44.125 --> 00:33:45.250
Take care.

00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:46.375
Here's your bag.

00:33:47.583 --> 00:33:48.791
Last night,

00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:52.166
I felt like
something was not right, Abuyya.

00:33:52.833 --> 00:33:55.916
I felt like something was trying
to get into my house.

00:33:56.375 --> 00:33:58.666
Then I also heard Grandma's voice.

00:33:59.916 --> 00:34:01.208
But is that possible, Abuyya?

00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:04.625
That the spirit of the recently deceased
can come to those closest to them

00:34:04.708 --> 00:34:05.708
before 40 days?

00:34:08.333 --> 00:34:13.791
Islam is not familiar
with the concept of spirits.

00:34:14.916 --> 00:34:19.541
Once someone dies and enters their grave,

00:34:19.625 --> 00:34:22.583
they will answer questions
from the angels.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:28.375
They'll be held accountable
for all the deeds they did in this world.

00:34:29.458 --> 00:34:36.541
So, if you see a figure

00:34:36.625 --> 00:34:41.208
who resembles someone you know has died,

00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:43.541
that's definitely the work of a jinn.

00:34:43.625 --> 00:34:46.708
Ya-Sin.

00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:49.875
By the Quran, rich in wisdom!

00:34:49.958 --> 00:34:53.333
You, O Prophet,
are truly one of the messengers

00:34:53.416 --> 00:34:56.875
upon the Straight Path.

00:34:56.958 --> 00:35:00.708
This is a revelation
from the Almighty, Most Merciful,

00:35:00.791 --> 00:35:03.333
so that you may warn a people

00:35:03.416 --> 00:35:07.250
whose forefathers were not warned,
and so are heedless.

00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:12.375
The decree of torment has already been
justified against most of them,

00:35:12.458 --> 00:35:14.291
for they will never believe.

00:35:33.625 --> 00:35:34.666
Dad?

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.583
Mom?

00:35:38.083 --> 00:35:39.000
Dean?

00:36:01.375 --> 00:36:02.625
Mom…

00:36:07.541 --> 00:36:08.708
Grandma,

00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:11.583
I miss you.

00:36:12.833 --> 00:36:14.333
You're still here, right?

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.750
Blood meets blood.

00:36:27.833 --> 00:36:29.541
ARDEAN FAHREZA
SON OF RUDIANTO NUGROHO

00:36:29.625 --> 00:36:31.916
Skin meets skin.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.041
Flesh meets flesh.

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.458
Breech blocked by breech.

00:36:36.541 --> 00:36:39.541
Black sky, black earth.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:53.000
I am controlled by my ancestors.

00:36:53.083 --> 00:36:58.708
All shall be destroyed before me.

00:37:04.458 --> 00:37:06.291
Destroyed.

00:37:06.916 --> 00:37:08.583
Destroyed.

00:37:10.166 --> 00:37:11.708
Destroyed.

00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:19.500
I call upon the Queen of Black Magic
in the high mountains.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.250
I know the Queen always desires something.

00:37:26.958 --> 00:37:29.291
I have brought her favorite offering.

00:37:29.375 --> 00:37:32.041
Accept my command.

00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:35.541
Destroy them all.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
PAIN, DARK, COLD, LONELY, SCARED.

00:37:47.083 --> 00:37:48.791
What else do you want to tell me?

00:37:56.833 --> 00:37:58.083
I…

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.958
K…

00:38:04.666 --> 00:38:05.958
U…

00:38:10.166 --> 00:38:11.333
T…

00:38:15.125 --> 00:38:16.500
O…

00:38:19.041 --> 00:38:20.083
M…

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:23.750
A…

00:38:23.833 --> 00:38:27.000
Ikut Oma? (Come with Grandma.)

00:38:34.291 --> 00:38:37.125
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:39.291
Thank you, ma'am.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:53.875
Tika!

00:38:53.958 --> 00:38:56.541
Mom! Dad! Help!

00:39:06.875 --> 00:39:07.625
Dean?

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.958
Dean?

00:39:22.125 --> 00:39:23.250
Dean?

00:39:31.083 --> 00:39:32.833
Tika! Mom!

00:39:32.916 --> 00:39:34.500
Dad! Help!

00:39:34.583 --> 00:39:35.666
Dean?

00:39:58.666 --> 00:40:01.583
Mom! Dad!

00:40:02.791 --> 00:40:04.208
What is it?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:05.833
Dean?!

00:40:05.916 --> 00:40:08.916
-Dean!
-Dean?

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.541
Tika, what happened to your brother?

00:40:10.625 --> 00:40:12.583
What happened?!

00:40:12.666 --> 00:40:15.250
-Dean?
-Dean!

00:40:15.333 --> 00:40:18.291
Astaghfirullah.

00:40:21.291 --> 00:40:23.875
ARDEAN FAHREZA
SON OF RUDIANTO NUGROHO

00:40:23.958 --> 00:40:25.875
BORN 22 MAY 1988
DIED 18 MARCH 2000

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:29.500
Thank you.

00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:03.750
This isn't all
because of that shaman, right, Yul?

00:41:04.791 --> 00:41:07.416
Your nephew didn't die
because of what we did, right?

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.166
He is not my nephew.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:13.166
I wanted to help you because I know
you are being bullied by them.

00:41:14.458 --> 00:41:15.916
But not like this.

00:41:16.458 --> 00:41:18.125
You're out of your mind, Yuli.

00:41:18.875 --> 00:41:20.916
You were there from the start.

00:41:22.375 --> 00:41:23.666
That means you are involved.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.875
And what they are experiencing now
is karma.

00:41:30.625 --> 00:41:31.791
It's not because of me.

00:41:36.041 --> 00:41:38.333
It's all my fault, Abuyya.

00:41:40.583 --> 00:41:43.250
I should have talked him out of it.

00:41:43.333 --> 00:41:46.000
I should have just taken his board.

00:41:46.083 --> 00:41:48.541
I should have checked his room
straight away before the prayers.

00:41:48.625 --> 00:41:49.958
Ask for forgiveness, Tika.

00:41:51.583 --> 00:41:56.291
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

00:41:56.375 --> 00:41:59.583
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

00:42:02.041 --> 00:42:05.625
I feel like there's something evil
directed towards my family.

00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:08.291
But I don't understand what it is.

00:42:08.375 --> 00:42:10.791
What should I do, Abuyya?

00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:14.833
The Prophet Muhammad was once bewitched

00:42:15.458 --> 00:42:20.500
by a woman using a knot that was tied up.

00:42:21.916 --> 00:42:25.125
Then the knot was placed under a stone

00:42:25.208 --> 00:42:27.166
at the bottom of the Dzarwan well.

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:31.708
Then the Prophet ordered his companions
to come and see the well the next day.

00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:34.458
And coincidentally,

00:42:36.041 --> 00:42:40.041
Al-Mu'awwidzatain's revelation came down.

00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:43.958
Namely, the surahs Al-Falaq and An-Naas.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.791
At that time,
they were recited by Rasulullah.

00:42:46.875 --> 00:42:50.833
Then, the rope that tied the binding knots

00:42:50.916 --> 00:42:53.583
broke one by one, all eleven of them.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.500
Tonight, you should pray
the Tahajjud prayer.

00:43:00.416 --> 00:43:03.000
Perform your ablutions and pray.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.708
Ask for forgiveness from Allah.

00:43:05.791 --> 00:43:11.208
I intend to perform the Tahajjud prayer,
two rak'ahs, for the sake of Allah.

00:43:12.875 --> 00:43:16.208
Allah is the Greatest.

00:43:16.291 --> 00:43:19.250
Then after that, send prayers.

00:43:19.333 --> 00:43:21.583
Ask Allah for protection.

00:43:23.666 --> 00:43:25.166
O, Allah.

00:43:28.625 --> 00:43:31.333
Please protect my parents…

00:43:33.791 --> 00:43:36.958
Rudianto and Larasati

00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:40.041
from all danger and deceit.

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:46.041
Amen.

00:44:02.583 --> 00:44:03.500
Hey.

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:05.000
Wait.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:06.958
Hey.

00:44:07.833 --> 00:44:08.875
Laras.

00:44:11.125 --> 00:44:12.750
Where are you going?

00:44:12.833 --> 00:44:14.041
To the shop.

00:44:14.625 --> 00:44:15.666
To the shop?

00:44:17.708 --> 00:44:19.416
Don't you have a heart?

00:44:20.708 --> 00:44:22.208
Our son just died.

00:44:23.208 --> 00:44:25.708
-Now you're going to work?
-Then what should I do?

00:44:30.458 --> 00:44:32.708
I've just lost my son.

00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:34.083
I lost my mother too.

00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:36.333
Tell me, what am I supposed to do?

00:44:38.708 --> 00:44:40.791
Be a mother, Laras.

00:44:42.083 --> 00:44:43.666
It hasn't even been a day.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.125
There's no one to look after the shop.

00:44:45.208 --> 00:44:47.500
-Just ask Yono.
-No, I can't.

00:44:53.541 --> 00:44:55.541
I've told you many times, right?

00:44:55.625 --> 00:44:58.000
If you're putting something away,
be careful, Rudi.

00:44:58.083 --> 00:44:59.833
Look what happened.

00:44:59.916 --> 00:45:02.000
Now it's broken.

00:45:04.291 --> 00:45:06.000
What's wrong? Let me see.

00:45:06.083 --> 00:45:06.958
No need.

00:45:07.041 --> 00:45:08.666
Fine, if you don't want my help.

00:45:21.625 --> 00:45:23.916
Just leave it. Leave it.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.375
Let me put something on it
so you can continue working.

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.625
Thank you, Yul.

00:45:45.625 --> 00:45:47.041
Just leave it.

00:45:47.916 --> 00:45:49.291
I'll sort it out later.

00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:10.541
What now?

00:46:10.625 --> 00:46:14.500
-I dropped these.
-What's wrong with you, Yuli?

00:46:14.583 --> 00:46:17.333
You never get anything done when you work.

00:46:17.416 --> 00:46:20.333
All you do is make my life difficult.

00:46:20.416 --> 00:46:21.541
-Because of you…
-Enough, Ras!

00:46:23.458 --> 00:46:25.625
Why are you defending her?

00:46:27.041 --> 00:46:29.541
This should've been your job.

00:46:30.291 --> 00:46:31.833
That's enough.

00:46:31.916 --> 00:46:34.250
How can you say that to me?

00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:36.041
Is she using
some kind of black magic on you?

00:46:36.125 --> 00:46:37.791
I'm just being honest, Ras.

00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:39.583
Yuli has never fought back.

00:46:39.666 --> 00:46:41.250
Your family treats her like a maid

00:46:41.333 --> 00:46:43.083
even though she is family, right?

00:46:43.166 --> 00:46:44.333
She is not family.

00:46:44.416 --> 00:46:46.125
Then stop ordering her around.

00:46:46.208 --> 00:46:48.708
All you do is order people around.

00:46:48.791 --> 00:46:51.041
That's why you married me, right?

00:46:53.166 --> 00:46:54.250
Because I am poor.

00:46:55.875 --> 00:46:56.958
Stupid.

00:46:57.041 --> 00:46:58.958
You can push me around.

00:46:59.541 --> 00:47:01.333
"Rudi, lift that."

00:47:01.416 --> 00:47:03.791
"Why did you put it there?"

00:47:03.875 --> 00:47:05.916
"Why aren't you getting smarter?"

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.416
I've never said that.

00:47:09.541 --> 00:47:11.166
Rudianto, you are so mean!

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:12.791
My son just died!

00:47:16.666 --> 00:47:18.041
Our son, Ras.

00:47:19.083 --> 00:47:21.250
You're not the only one grieving.

00:48:02.458 --> 00:48:03.625
I…

00:48:05.333 --> 00:48:06.666
Hang in there, Rudi.

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:16.458
I understand.

00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:18.416
She never does.

00:49:05.916 --> 00:49:09.125
LARAS, MY WIFE

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:42.375
Would you like to close up shop, ma'am?

00:49:42.458 --> 00:49:43.750
Take me home.

00:49:57.166 --> 00:49:58.125
Rudi.

00:49:59.541 --> 00:50:02.166
If you could choose…

00:50:04.333 --> 00:50:05.833
would you stay with me?

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:10.083
Just leave Laras.

00:50:13.041 --> 00:50:15.375
If you choose me,

00:50:16.708 --> 00:50:20.791
we will live happily together.

00:50:20.875 --> 00:50:22.208
Forever.

00:50:29.291 --> 00:50:30.500
I can't, Yuli.

00:50:33.416 --> 00:50:34.958
I have a family.

00:50:47.583 --> 00:50:52.541
Do you think Laras will take you back
if she knows about this?

00:50:54.416 --> 00:50:55.583
You're the one who seduced me.

00:50:56.208 --> 00:50:57.416
It turns out Laras was right.

00:50:57.875 --> 00:50:59.333
You are just like your mother.

00:50:59.833 --> 00:51:01.750
You're such an asshole.

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:05.875
Don't ever bring up my mother.
My mother is not like that.

00:51:08.458 --> 00:51:09.916
You're out of your mind, Yuli.

00:51:22.541 --> 00:51:23.458
Tika.

00:51:23.916 --> 00:51:25.250
Please don't tell your mother.

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:28.333
I'll explain it to her later.

00:52:31.416 --> 00:52:36.083
There is no god but Allah,
alone, without partner.

00:52:36.166 --> 00:52:39.083
His is the dominion and the praise.
He gives life and causes death.

00:52:39.166 --> 00:52:42.750
He has power over all things.

00:52:42.833 --> 00:52:44.708
There is no…

00:52:56.041 --> 00:52:58.416
There is no god but Allah,

00:53:01.208 --> 00:53:03.625
alone, without partner.

00:53:04.916 --> 00:53:07.916
His is the dominion and the praise.

00:53:08.583 --> 00:53:10.833
He gives life and causes death.

00:53:10.916 --> 00:53:12.875
He has power over all things.

00:53:32.333 --> 00:53:35.916
RUDIANTO NUGROHO
SON OF WIRAWAN

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.166
Blood meets blood.

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:40.708
Skin meets skin.

00:53:40.791 --> 00:53:42.208
Flesh meets flesh.

00:53:42.291 --> 00:53:44.291
There is no god but Allah.

00:53:44.375 --> 00:53:46.625
There is no god but Allah.

00:53:46.708 --> 00:53:48.375
There is no god but Allah.

00:53:48.458 --> 00:53:50.708
Breech blocked by breech.

00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:53.583
Black sky, black earth.

00:53:53.666 --> 00:53:56.916
I am controlled by my ancestors.

00:53:57.541 --> 00:54:01.291
All shall be destroyed before me.

00:54:07.416 --> 00:54:08.750
Destroyed.

00:54:08.833 --> 00:54:09.833
Destroyed.

00:54:09.916 --> 00:54:10.791
Destroyed.

00:54:10.875 --> 00:54:12.958
There is no god but Allah.

00:54:13.041 --> 00:54:15.291
There is no god but Allah.

00:54:15.375 --> 00:54:17.166
There is no god but Allah.

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:19.958
There is no god but Allah.

00:54:20.041 --> 00:54:22.083
There is no god but Allah.

00:54:22.166 --> 00:54:24.166
There is no god but Allah.

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:28.500
I call upon the Queen of Black Magic
in the high mountains.

00:54:32.291 --> 00:54:36.083
I know the Queen always desires something.

00:54:40.041 --> 00:54:43.875
I have brought her favorite offering.

00:54:43.958 --> 00:54:45.958
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

00:54:46.875 --> 00:54:50.041
There is no god but Allah,
alone, without partner.

00:54:50.125 --> 00:54:53.958
Accept my command. Destroy…

00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:56.375
His is the dominion and the praise.
He gives life and causes death.

00:54:56.458 --> 00:54:57.875
He has power over all things.

00:54:57.958 --> 00:54:59.500
…them all.

00:57:52.875 --> 00:57:53.666
Rudi?

00:57:56.541 --> 00:57:58.458
Tika! Help!

00:57:58.541 --> 00:58:00.708
Please, Tika!

00:58:00.791 --> 00:58:02.291
Help!

00:58:02.375 --> 00:58:04.041
Help!

00:58:04.125 --> 00:58:06.291
-Rudi?
-Help!

00:58:06.625 --> 00:58:09.458
Please, Tika!

00:58:09.541 --> 00:58:11.500
Laras!

00:58:32.583 --> 00:58:35.166
This prayer will have four takbirs,

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:39.125
and in each takbir,
there is no bowing or prostration.

00:58:39.208 --> 00:58:41.958
Ending with a salaam, all right?

00:58:42.041 --> 00:58:43.291
Let's begin.

00:58:45.583 --> 00:58:52.541
I intend to perform the funeral prayer
for this deceased man, with four takbirs…

00:58:52.625 --> 00:58:56.625
Allah is the Greatest.

00:58:56.708 --> 00:58:59.583
Allah is the Greatest.

00:59:08.458 --> 00:59:11.166
Allah is the Greatest.

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:13.916
Allah is the Greatest.

00:59:17.375 --> 00:59:19.625
Allah is the Greatest.

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.625
Allah is the Greatest.

00:59:30.666 --> 00:59:35.958
O Allah, forgive him, have mercy on him,
grant him peace, and pardon him.

00:59:38.958 --> 00:59:41.791
Allah is the Greatest.

00:59:41.875 --> 00:59:45.666
Allah is the Greatest.

00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:57.291
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah.

00:59:57.375 --> 01:00:01.416
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah.

01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:14.666
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah.

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:16.666
Peace be upon you…

01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:38.416
Oh God.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.833
Tika?

01:00:41.708 --> 01:00:43.791
Please get her a drink.

01:00:43.875 --> 01:00:45.708
Come on, get some water.

01:00:45.791 --> 01:00:47.625
Oh my God!

01:00:47.708 --> 01:00:50.791
Oh God. Tika.

01:00:50.875 --> 01:00:52.000
Ask for forgiveness, Tika.

01:00:52.083 --> 01:00:54.750
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

01:00:56.208 --> 01:00:57.500
Allah.

01:00:57.583 --> 01:00:59.500
Tika. Drink.

01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:22.666
Tika…

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:23.958
Mom.

01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:26.875
This can't be a coincidence, Mom.

01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:30.041
Dad, Dean, Grandma.

01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:32.500
-Abuyya also told me…
-That's enough.

01:01:33.916 --> 01:01:35.541
Enough.

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:38.375
Don't talk about things
that don't make sense.

01:01:41.666 --> 01:01:42.750
That's enough.

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:45.750
But someone is harming us, Mom.

01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:48.416
We have to do something.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.041
Please listen to me.

01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:54.041
Just this once, will you believe me, Mom?

01:01:55.125 --> 01:01:56.625
I…

01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:01.041
I don't want to lose anyone else, Mom.

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:07.958
You're all I have left.

01:02:08.041 --> 01:02:11.083
I don't have anyone else.

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:14.958
I'm scared.

01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:23.708
It is true that

01:02:25.166 --> 01:02:27.583
if we claim to have faith,

01:02:27.666 --> 01:02:29.958
surely Allah will test it.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.583
With a feeling of fear,
a feeling of worry,

01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:36.833
We will certainly test you
with a touch of fear and famine

01:02:36.916 --> 01:02:40.625
and loss of property, life, and crops.

01:02:40.708 --> 01:02:43.500
Allah will even test us
with a lack of wealth.

01:02:43.583 --> 01:02:47.041
Allah tests us
by taking the people we love.

01:02:47.125 --> 01:02:50.041
Parents, younger siblings, older siblings.

01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:53.333
Be patient, all right?

01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:55.083
Remember,

01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:59.166
Allah will not test His servants

01:02:59.916 --> 01:03:02.208
beyond the limits of their ability.

01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:05.250
Amen.

01:03:32.625 --> 01:03:33.666
Yuli?

01:04:19.416 --> 01:04:21.500
Why is this here?

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:30.625
You can figure it out yourself.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.458
Rudi never loved you.

01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:38.208
He was just scared of you.

01:04:41.833 --> 01:04:43.250
How dare you?

01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:46.750
It was you, right?
You're the one who seduced him!

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.375
And you're the one
who killed my whole family.

01:04:51.875 --> 01:04:53.250
Damn you.

01:04:53.833 --> 01:04:55.541
You bastard child.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.708
You're a slut, just like your mother!

01:05:00.916 --> 01:05:03.041
You're all tough now, aren't you?

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:05.916
You dare to go against me?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.916
Yes, I'm going against you.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.416
Why should I be afraid?
Who do you think you are?

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.208
You are the bastard child, not me.

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:15.250
What?

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:19.791
-Trash.
-You're trash.

01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:21.541
-Bastard.
-You're the bastard!

01:05:21.625 --> 01:05:24.250
You have taken all my happiness, Yuli.

01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:26.541
-You ruined my life.
-That should have been my life!

01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:28.083
You should be the one dead!

01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:29.916
-Get out of here!
-You go!

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.791
-Get out of here.
-This is still my house!

01:05:31.875 --> 01:05:33.458
-Get out of here!
-This is my house!

01:05:33.541 --> 01:05:35.625
You're just like your mother!

01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:38.458
Laras, open the door.

01:05:38.541 --> 01:05:40.291
Laras, open up!

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:42.916
You are all evil!

01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:49.166
You've been mean to me from the start.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:52.333
How long do you want to live like this?

01:05:56.541 --> 01:05:57.875
Laras, listen to me.

01:05:58.416 --> 01:06:00.666
Don't you realize?

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:04.166
You're the one who caused
all your family to die!

01:06:12.625 --> 01:06:14.500
Our lives are the same now, Ras.

01:06:16.416 --> 01:06:18.083
The same.

01:06:19.666 --> 01:06:21.791
We're both ruined!

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:00.416
Yono.

01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:03.291
What did you say to Tika?

01:07:03.375 --> 01:07:05.041
I didn't say anything.

01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:07.750
You didn't say anything?

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:09.791
What did you say?

01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:14.208
Leave me out of this, Yuli.

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.125
What did Tika give you?

01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:22.041
Did you tell her about me?

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.791
Did you tell her that I did everything?

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:25.041
Admit it.

01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:26.958
I didn't say anything, Yul.

01:07:27.875 --> 01:07:30.000
Not everyone is as mean as you, Yul.

01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:38.708
MULYONO SON OF PARTO
21 MARCH 1965

01:07:38.791 --> 01:07:39.833
Destroyed.

01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:41.125
Destroyed.

01:07:41.208 --> 01:07:42.583
Destroyed.

01:07:44.875 --> 01:07:48.750
I call upon the Queen of Black Magic
in the high mountains.

01:07:49.583 --> 01:07:52.583
I know the Queen always desires something.

01:07:53.291 --> 01:07:54.583
I have brought

01:07:56.291 --> 01:07:57.916
her favorite offering.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.125
Accept my command.

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:04.166
Destroy them all.

01:09:43.958 --> 01:09:45.166
Who's that?

01:09:46.125 --> 01:09:47.541
Who's there?

01:09:47.625 --> 01:09:49.000
Stop messing around!

01:10:56.833 --> 01:10:58.041
Help!

01:10:58.125 --> 01:10:59.541
Help!

01:11:19.166 --> 01:11:20.458
-Mrs. Laras!
-Ma'am!

01:11:20.541 --> 01:11:22.166
It's Mr. Yono, ma'am!

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:24.250
-Ma'am, Mr. Yono, ma'am.
-At your shop, ma'am.

01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:25.791
-Oh God!
-Please step back.

01:11:25.875 --> 01:11:30.000
Please, step back, step back.
Stay behind the police line.

01:11:30.083 --> 01:11:31.750
Excuse me, sorry.

01:11:31.833 --> 01:11:33.583
Excuse me.

01:11:33.666 --> 01:11:34.916
Sorry, sorry.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.875
-Ma'am, don't come in.
-I own the shop, sir.

01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:38.750
All right, ma'am.

01:11:41.625 --> 01:11:43.458
Oh my God!

01:11:44.083 --> 01:11:45.458
Mom? Mom!

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.333
Mom.

01:11:47.416 --> 01:11:49.291
Mom…

01:11:50.416 --> 01:11:52.541
-Poor Mr. Yono.
-I can't believe it.

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:54.833
His head…

01:11:57.208 --> 01:12:00.000
LARAS DEWI
DAUGHTER OF SATYA PURWOKO

01:12:42.833 --> 01:12:44.375
Mom?

01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:06.458
Mom?

01:13:10.083 --> 01:13:11.208
Mom?

01:13:17.666 --> 01:13:18.625
Mom?

01:13:51.666 --> 01:13:54.250
No, Mom, don't!

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:59.166
All of you

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:02.333
will die.

01:14:03.208 --> 01:14:05.708
Allah! There is no deity except Him, the
Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence.

01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:07.833
Neither drowsiness overtakes Him
nor sleep.

01:14:07.916 --> 01:14:10.208
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens
and whatever is on the earth.

01:14:10.291 --> 01:14:12.708
Who is it that can intercede with Him
except by His permission?

01:14:12.791 --> 01:14:15.416
He knows what is [presently] before them
and what will be after them,

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.833
and they encompass not a thing
of His knowledge except for what He wills.

01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:21.291
His throne extends over the heavens
and the earth,

01:14:21.375 --> 01:14:23.666
and their preservation does not tire Him.

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:27.291
And He is the Most High, the Most Great.

01:14:30.375 --> 01:14:32.458
Where are

01:14:32.541 --> 01:14:36.291
your other prayers?

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:43.458
Abuyya?

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.000
Abuyya, please help me.

01:15:47.083 --> 01:15:49.333
My mom, she's…

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:07.791
Mom! Don't, Mom!

01:18:33.833 --> 01:18:35.125
In the name of Allah,

01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:38.291
with whose name nothing on earth
or in the heavens can cause harm.

01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:40.083
And He is the All-Hearing,
the All-Knowing.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.416
We'll take your mother to the mosque.

01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:48.291
Come on.

01:18:51.208 --> 01:18:52.666
Come on, be careful.

01:18:53.458 --> 01:18:54.750
Come on.

01:19:03.708 --> 01:19:05.541
Don't rush.

01:19:16.291 --> 01:19:20.625
KARTIKA ANGGRAINI
DAUGHTER OF RUDIANTO NUGROHO

01:20:00.625 --> 01:20:02.041
Oh God!

01:20:04.708 --> 01:20:06.041
Grandma…

01:20:09.458 --> 01:20:11.666
Don't mention your God's name here.

01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:14.708
Aunt Yuli?

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:21.958
What's the matter, Tika?

01:20:26.125 --> 01:20:27.166
Yes.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.500
I killed all your family.

01:20:35.333 --> 01:20:37.708
They all deserved this.

01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:40.375
Even Dean?

01:20:40.791 --> 01:20:42.041
My dad?

01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:45.875
-My mom now, because of you?
-Everyone.

01:20:47.208 --> 01:20:49.333
Your family is evil, Tika.

01:20:49.833 --> 01:20:52.375
Since I was little,

01:20:53.583 --> 01:20:58.416
I have never been treated well
by your family.

01:20:59.375 --> 01:21:01.541
They called me a bastard child.

01:21:01.625 --> 01:21:03.583
I'm not.

01:21:05.291 --> 01:21:07.541
Your grandmother lied.

01:21:09.041 --> 01:21:12.416
She took everything I had, Tika.

01:21:13.583 --> 01:21:16.500
She killed my parents using black magic.

01:21:18.041 --> 01:21:19.916
She took my house.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.250
My parents.

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:23.000
My life was ruined!

01:21:26.708 --> 01:21:30.208
Your parents deserved to die!

01:21:31.583 --> 01:21:39.666
I'll never regret doing it
with my own hands.

01:21:45.916 --> 01:21:48.416
Why didn't you ever tell me?

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.041
Auntie, we are a family.

01:21:53.166 --> 01:21:55.166
You're such a good girl.

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.916
-Am I family?
-Of course!

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.416
-Yes, Auntie…
-Every day, you saw me being tormented.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.666
I was insulted by your mother.
By your grandmother.

01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:05.875
And what did you do?

01:22:05.958 --> 01:22:07.625
Answer me! What did you do?

01:22:08.333 --> 01:22:10.375
-I had no choice--
-You pretend to be so pious.

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:12.500
But you never stood up for me!

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.625
You are a hypocrite.

01:22:15.625 --> 01:22:18.041
You and your family deserve to die.

01:22:27.666 --> 01:22:29.000
You're cruel!

01:22:29.083 --> 01:22:30.750
That's how it feels to be me.

01:22:30.833 --> 01:22:32.875
I will never be like you.

01:22:32.958 --> 01:22:34.958
-Destroyed, right?
-No.

01:22:39.791 --> 01:22:40.583
Mom…

01:22:41.708 --> 01:22:43.083
Mom…

01:22:45.416 --> 01:22:47.125
Come on, continue.

01:22:54.458 --> 01:22:57.333
Step back. Join them over there.

01:23:00.958 --> 01:23:05.708
I seek forgiveness
from Allah the Almighty.

01:23:05.791 --> 01:23:07.791
I seek refuge in Allah
from the accursed Satan.

01:23:07.875 --> 01:23:09.541
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

01:23:09.625 --> 01:23:12.375
O Allah, You come from peace
and from you comes peace,

01:23:12.458 --> 01:23:16.750
and may peace be upon you.

01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:22.041
Blessed are You,
o owner of majesty and honor.

01:23:23.416 --> 01:23:26.375
I seek refuge in Allah
from the accursed Satan.

01:23:29.833 --> 01:23:32.625
In the name of Allah,
I perform an exorcism for you

01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:35.708
from everything that harms you,

01:23:35.791 --> 01:23:38.333
from the evil of every soul
or envious eye.

01:23:38.416 --> 01:23:40.083
May Allah heal you.

01:23:50.166 --> 01:23:51.708
I seek refuge in Allah
from the accursed Satan.

01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:53.500
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

01:23:53.583 --> 01:23:55.375
Say, O Prophet,
"O Allah! Lord over all authorities!

01:23:55.458 --> 01:23:58.500
You give authority to whoever You please
and remove it from who You please.

01:23:58.583 --> 01:24:00.375
You honor whoever You please
and disgrace who You please.

01:24:00.458 --> 01:24:04.625
All good is in Your Hands. Surely
You alone are Most Capable of everything.

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:08.375
You cause the night to pass into the day
and the day into the night.

01:24:08.458 --> 01:24:12.833
You bring forth the living from the dead
and the dead from the living.

01:24:12.916 --> 01:24:15.875
And You provide for whoever You will
without limit."

01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:21.458
In the name of Allah,
Allah is the Greatest.

01:24:35.791 --> 01:24:36.833
Mom!

01:24:51.416 --> 01:24:53.375
Blood meets blood.

01:24:53.833 --> 01:24:55.750
Skin meets skin.

01:24:55.833 --> 01:24:57.208
Flesh meets flesh.

01:24:58.208 --> 01:25:00.375
Breech blocked by breech.

01:25:00.833 --> 01:25:04.166
I am controlled by my ancestors.

01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:08.708
All shall be destroyed before me.

01:25:13.625 --> 01:25:15.750
Stay out of it, or you will be destroyed!

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:17.500
Indeed, it is from Solomon,

01:25:17.583 --> 01:25:19.916
and indeed it is in the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:22.916
Oh God!

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.125
Destroyed.

01:25:24.833 --> 01:25:26.333
Destroyed.

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:30.875
I seek refuge in Allah
from the accursed Satan.

01:25:30.958 --> 01:25:32.666
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:34.000
Say, O Prophet,

01:25:34.083 --> 01:25:36.500
"It has been revealed to me that a group
of jinn listened to the Quran…"

01:25:36.583 --> 01:25:37.666
I call upon…

01:25:41.208 --> 01:25:43.541
I call upon the Queen of Black Magic.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.541
"…and said to their fellow jinn, indeed,
we have heard a wondrous recitation.

01:25:48.625 --> 01:25:50.250
It leads to Right Guidance."

01:25:50.333 --> 01:25:53.250
I call upon the Queen of Black Magic
in the high mountains.

01:25:54.833 --> 01:25:56.041
"…so we believed in it,

01:25:56.125 --> 01:25:58.916
and we will never associate anyone
with our Lord in worship."

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.458
I know…

01:26:02.041 --> 01:26:04.958
"Now, we believe that our Lord,
Exalted is His Majesty,

01:26:05.041 --> 01:26:07.500
has neither a mate nor offspring…

01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:18.958
and that the foolish of us used to utter
outrageous falsehoods about Allah."

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:29.833
"We certainly thought that humans and jinn
would never speak lies about Allah."

01:26:34.458 --> 01:26:41.000
"And some men used to
seek refuge with some jinn,

01:26:41.083 --> 01:26:43.041
so they increased each other
in wickedness."

01:26:46.541 --> 01:26:48.708
In the name of Allah,
Allah is the Greatest.

01:26:55.375 --> 01:26:57.625
Allah is Sufficient for us,
and He is the Best Disposer of affairs.

01:26:57.958 --> 01:26:59.041
Mom?

01:26:59.125 --> 01:27:01.625
-Astaghfirullahaladzim.
-Mom?

01:27:01.708 --> 01:27:02.958
Mom?

01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:04.583
Come on, help her up.

01:27:17.458 --> 01:27:18.791
Continue the prayers.

01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:23.666
I seek refuge in Allah
from the accursed Satan.

01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:27.166
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

01:27:27.250 --> 01:27:29.750
Say, O Prophet, He is Allah.
One and Indivisible.

01:27:29.833 --> 01:27:31.541
Allah, the Sustainer, needed by all.

01:27:31.625 --> 01:27:33.250
He has never had offspring,
nor was He born,

01:27:33.333 --> 01:27:36.125
and there is none comparable to Him.

01:27:36.208 --> 01:27:39.125
I seek refuge in Allah
from the accursed Satan.

01:27:39.208 --> 01:27:42.500
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:45.166
Say, O Prophet, I seek refuge
in the Lord of the daybreak

01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:47.166
from the evil of whatever He has created,

01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:50.125
and from the evil of the night
when it grows dark,

01:27:50.208 --> 01:27:53.583
and from the evil of those witches
casting spells by blowing onto knots,

01:27:53.666 --> 01:27:56.833
and from the evil of an envier
when they envy.

01:27:57.583 --> 01:28:01.375
I seek refuge in Allah
from the accursed Satan.

01:28:01.458 --> 01:28:04.791
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

01:28:04.875 --> 01:28:07.750
Say, O Prophet, I seek refuge
in the Lord of humankind,

01:28:07.833 --> 01:28:11.916
the Master of humankind,
the God of humankind,

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:18.833
from the evil of the lurking whisperer,
who whispers into the hearts of humankind,

01:28:18.916 --> 01:28:21.916
from among jinn and humankind.

01:28:28.208 --> 01:28:30.958
Enough, Tika! Enough.

01:28:31.875 --> 01:28:33.416
-Get some water.
-Enough!

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.250
Enough, Tika.

01:28:39.958 --> 01:28:41.333
Tika.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.666
Pray for your mom.

01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:48.750
Let her go.

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:59.583
My Lord, forgive me and my parents,

01:28:59.666 --> 01:29:05.541
and have mercy on them
as they raised me when I was small.

01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:13.250
Help!

01:29:13.333 --> 01:29:15.125
I seek refuge in Allah
from the accursed Satan.

01:29:15.208 --> 01:29:17.166
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:21.708
In Your Name,
we repel enemies from all directions.

01:29:21.791 --> 01:29:24.875
In the name of Allah,
we pelt them from afar into disarray.

01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:27.500
You are my hope, O God and my Master.

01:29:27.583 --> 01:29:29.875
You are my hope, O God and my Master.

01:29:29.958 --> 01:29:34.750
If they intend evil against me,
then let them boil.

01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:38.833
In the name of Allah,
Allah is the Greatest!

01:30:24.166 --> 01:30:25.500
O Allah…

01:30:39.666 --> 01:30:42.958
May God forgive her sins.

01:30:47.125 --> 01:30:48.125
Mom?

01:30:49.375 --> 01:30:50.375
Mom…

01:30:51.375 --> 01:30:53.041
Mom, it's me, Tika, Mom.

01:30:54.708 --> 01:30:56.458
It's Tika.

01:30:57.791 --> 01:30:59.250
Mrs. Laras?

01:31:01.166 --> 01:31:03.625
-Seek forgiveness.
-Mom!

01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:07.750
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

01:31:07.833 --> 01:31:12.416
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

01:31:13.041 --> 01:31:17.541
I… I seek…

01:31:17.625 --> 01:31:23.125
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

01:31:23.208 --> 01:31:25.666
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:28.416
…forgiveness from Allah the Almighty.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:34.000
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

01:31:35.541 --> 01:31:40.500
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

01:31:41.541 --> 01:31:42.625
Tika.

01:31:42.708 --> 01:31:44.458
It's okay.

01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:48.250
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

01:31:48.333 --> 01:31:54.125
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:59.208
I seek forgiveness from
Allah the Almighty.

01:31:59.291 --> 01:32:04.541
There is no god but Allah,
and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.

01:32:04.625 --> 01:32:06.000
Mom?

01:32:06.083 --> 01:32:09.458
Indeed, we belong to Allah,
and to Him we shall return.
