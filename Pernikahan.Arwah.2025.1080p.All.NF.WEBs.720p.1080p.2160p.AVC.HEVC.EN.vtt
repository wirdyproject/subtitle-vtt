LASEM, CENTRAL JAVA, 1943

00:00:56.708 --> 00:01:00.458
TIO MEI HWA AND BHANU

3
00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:11.416
May you be together all your lives.

4
00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.250
May your love last a thousand years.

5
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.416
May you be blessed with many children.

6
00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:32.208
May you live long.

7
00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:34.125
Do you want me to teach you how to smile?

8
00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:38.875
I'm making you look this pretty
for you to smile,

9
00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.541
not for you to frown.

10
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.333
I'm sure your parents would be happy.

11
00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:54.583
They might be watching you from heaven
at this very moment.

12
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.541
Or they may be preparing to attend
your "Sangjit" (betrothal rituals).

13
00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:03.250
How romantic.

14
00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:10.041
Let me see.

15
00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:12.083
Here, develop it yourself, okay?

16
00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:14.000
I'll just go to a film shop.

17
00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:16.666
You're starting to get on my nerves.
Do you have to act like an artist?

18
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.916
The photos have to be aesthetic,
you have to use film...

19
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.166
Of course.

20
00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:22.875
- What? You want freebies?
- I will put makeup on you.

21
00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.541
- Get back, the camera can't fit you.
- Now.

22
00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:25.625
What?

23
00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:28.583
- Is everything ready?
- Just a moment.

24
00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:30.875
- Hi.
- Your wife will be ready soon.

25
00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.500
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

26
00:03:32.583 --> 00:03:34.833
- Let me give you a touch-up.
- Hang on, I have to work.

27
00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.208
Your lipstick tastes like strawberry.

28
00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:47.750
Delicious right? It's so sweet.

29
00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:50.458
Yeah. Gosh, Salim.

30
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.375
- Yes. I'll wait outside.
- You ruin it.

31
00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:56.833
- All good?
- You'll be charged extra for this one.

32
00:03:56.916 --> 00:03:58.000
I can't believe it.

33
00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:03.583
The next gift is from Salim's family,

34
00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:06.000
a couple of candles
and two bottles of wine.

35
00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:08.708
Each candle has
a Liong and a Hong character,

36
00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:11.708
a dragon and a phoenix,
to symbolize welfare.

37
00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:14.708
Tasya is everything to me,

38
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.375
and I have never regretted anything

39
00:04:19.916 --> 00:04:21.416
from the first moment we met

40
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.750
through to today.

41
00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:28.958
- I love you, honey.
- I love you.

42
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:32.291
But I'm well aware that we're both here

43
00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.333
thanks to my adopted parents,

44
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:38.541
Mommy Linda and Daddy Chandra.

45
00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:42.875
If Tasya didn't work for you guys,

46
00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958
we wouldn't have met.

47
00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:47.583
Thank you, Mommy

48
00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:50.000
and Daddy,

49
00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:54.666
for taking care of me
since I was a little kid.

50
00:04:57.458 --> 00:04:59.416
Ever since I lost my mom and dad.

51
00:05:00.708 --> 00:05:04.000
So, cheers to Mommy Linda
and Daddy Chandra.

52
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:09.416
Cheers.

53
00:05:25.583 --> 00:05:29.250
Daddy, try this chicken. It's your favorite.

54
00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:30.875
- This is for you.
- Try this.

55
00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.291
I'll gladly take it.

56
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.916
- Do you want some chicken?
- No.

57
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.333
- Mommy, try it. Tasya ordered it.
- I did.

58
00:05:37.416 --> 00:05:38.583
I had it, no worries.

59
00:05:38.666 --> 00:05:40.875
- Is it good, Arin?
- Was this menu on the food tasting?

60
00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.791
- Really?
- This is so good.

61
00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:46.000
- You're so sweet.
- I totally trust your taste.

62
00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:49.333
- Who wants noodles? You?
- No, thanks, honey.

63
00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:54.250
Salim, seriously.
Tasya knows the best food.

64
00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:56.875
- You're too kind.
- This is so good.

65
00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.791
I'm always happy when I eat with you,
I don't know why.

66
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:49.750
Honey.

67
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.875
What's wrong?

68
00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.875
You're spacing out.

69
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.791
Just now,

70
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.833
I think I saw something.

71
00:07:01.916 --> 00:07:03.125
What did you see?

72
00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:05.791
I don't know. It was just a glimpse.

73
00:07:06.541 --> 00:07:08.375
I have dreamt about this.

74
00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:12.041
There's, like, this old house

75
00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:14.291
that I've never seen before.

76
00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:19.916
It's best if we don't think about it.

77
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.916
I was going to tell you that
during our Sangjit,

78
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.791
my Engkim called,
but I didn't get to pick up the phone.

79
00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:30.291
- Engkim?
- "Engkim" is what you call an aunt.

80
00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:32.458
- She is my father's cousin.
- You still have an aunt?

81
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:33.583
I do.

82
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.500
But we're not that close.

83
00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:38.958
I think the last time we met,
I was still in elementary school.

84
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.625
She should've come to our Sangjit.

85
00:07:42.708 --> 00:07:43.833
Daddy Chandra would have invited her.

86
00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:46.708
Do you have any tissues?

87
00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.500
No? Okay, I'll go and wash my hands.

88
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:14.458
Hello?

89
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:15.666
<i>Hello?</i>

90
00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:17.333
<i>Is this Salim Tio?</i>

91
00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:18.458
That's me. Who's this?

92
00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:21.750
<i>My name is Koh Chung Chung.</i>

93
00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:24.000
<i>I am a master in Lasem.</i>

94
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.083
<i>I'm calling to inform you</i>

95
00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:31.125
<i>that Ci Fang Fang passed away
yesterday in Lasem.</i>

96
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.916
<i>Can you come here?</i>

97
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.083
I'm sorry, what?

98
00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:36.833
- Engkim Fang Fang passed away?
<i>- Can you...</i>

99
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.375
- Hello? Sorry... the call is breaking up.
<i>- Can you...? Hello?</i>

100
00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:41.458
Hello?

101
00:08:57.916 --> 00:08:59.125
<i>Salim.</i>

102
00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:06.083
<i>I'm sorry that I couldn't come yesterday.</i>

103
00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:09.583
<i>Hurry and come home.</i>

104
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.916
<i>Somebody has to light the prayer stick
at the altar in the back room.</i>

105
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.375
The back room?

106
00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:21.166
Engkim?

107
00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:25.541
Hello?

108
00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:53.000
Engkim Fang Fang passed away.

109
00:09:54.208 --> 00:09:55.291
Was she sick?

110
00:09:56.291 --> 00:09:58.250
I don't know.
That's why I have to go there.

111
00:10:00.208 --> 00:10:02.083
What about our pre-wedding photoshoot?

112
00:10:03.291 --> 00:10:05.291
Do you really have to go?

113
00:10:05.916 --> 00:10:08.916
We can't cancel our tickets
to Hong Kong, Salim.

114
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.666
Also, Febri and Arin
have a very tight schedule.

115
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.916
- I'm afraid that...
- I know.

116
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.208
But how can I not handle her funeral?

117
00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:21.000
And there's going to be a whole lot
of complicated paperwork.

118
00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:23.541
Who is going to handle that if I don't?

119
00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:30.333
Here.

120
00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:32.666
You haven't had a nosebleed in so long.

121
00:10:33.583 --> 00:10:34.708
I think you should get some rest.

122
00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:36.750
Let's find someone else
to arrange the funeral.

123
00:10:39.458 --> 00:10:40.583
Honey.

124
00:10:42.416 --> 00:10:44.291
Engkim Fang Fang is

125
00:10:44.375 --> 00:10:45.875
the only blood relative I have left.

126
00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:49.583
I am the only one she has left.

127
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.458
No matter what, I should be the one

128
00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:53.833
who bids her farewell.

129
00:10:56.166 --> 00:10:57.416
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.458
<i>Isn't there something that
you can move around?</i>

131
00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958
<i>Help me out here. Just squeeze me
into your schedule or something.</i>

132
00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:03.083
I mean, I wish I could.

133
00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:05.166
But I'm busy for the next three months.

134
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.625
<i>Okay. I'll tell you what.</i>

135
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:07.875
<i>Let's do the photo shoot here.</i>

136
00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958
<i>The house here has a very classic
Chinese-looking design.</i>

137
00:11:12.041 --> 00:11:13.750
<i>It fits... our concept.</i>

138
00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:15.791
Hello? Salim.

139
00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:17.125
Hey.

140
00:11:18.791 --> 00:11:21.291
He thinks he can change the location
whenever he wants.

141
00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:24.958
What do you say, Tasya?

142
00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:27.291
Listen.

143
00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:31.583
If it's your decision to move the location
to Salim's house,

144
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.416
then don't worry, I'll still do my best.

145
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.375
Take it easy.

146
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.625
Salim!

147
00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:09.750
AT THE VILLAGE OFFICE
WORKING ON THE PAPERWORK.

148
00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:10.708
I JUST BURIED ENGKIM.

149
00:14:10.791 --> 00:14:12.291
THIS IS THE ADDRESS.
NO CELL SERVICE SOON.

150
00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:13.291
I LOVE YOU. SEE YOU.

151
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:21.833
<i>The number you are calling
is out of the service area.</i>

152
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:34.833
Is this the place?

153
00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:37.541
Yes.

154
00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.041
Okay.

155
00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:42.916
Thank you.

156
00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:22.208
Salim.

157
00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:35.666
Salim.

158
00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:39.708
Salim.

159
00:16:46.458 --> 00:16:47.625
Salim.

160
00:18:52.875 --> 00:18:53.791
Salim.

161
00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:38.625
Salim.

162
00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:09.708
Honey.

163
00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:11.250
- Salim.
- What's wrong?

164
00:20:15.916 --> 00:20:17.125
I'm okay.

165
00:20:25.583 --> 00:20:27.708
We can't stay in this house for too long.

166
00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:32.041
What's wrong, honey?

167
00:20:36.458 --> 00:20:37.666
This house...

168
00:20:41.208 --> 00:20:43.333
is the house in my dream.

169
00:20:48.583 --> 00:20:50.500
And you were inside a coffin.

170
00:21:05.875 --> 00:21:07.708
How about this?

171
00:21:07.791 --> 00:21:09.291
Tomorrow morning,

172
00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:12.333
we'll pray at the altar of my ancestors.

173
00:21:12.416 --> 00:21:15.000
Maybe your dream is telling you that

174
00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:18.791
we have to ask for their blessings
before we get married.

175
00:21:19.666 --> 00:21:20.625
Okay?

176
00:22:18.791 --> 00:22:19.875
Here.

177
00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:23.458
Why four sticks?

178
00:22:24.083 --> 00:22:25.333
Doesn't four mean...?

179
00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:29.541
It means we have to pray towards
the four cardinal points

180
00:22:29.625 --> 00:22:32.333
to show respect to our parents

181
00:22:33.208 --> 00:22:35.333
or to our ancestors
who passed away long ago.

182
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.416
Excuse me.

183
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.750
Tasya.

184
00:23:35.708 --> 00:23:36.791
It's empty.

185
00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:39.000
Yeah. I wonder where everybody is?

186
00:23:39.083 --> 00:23:40.625
This is crazy.

187
00:23:41.208 --> 00:23:43.250
This is just like the house of Ip Man.

188
00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:44.458
What?

189
00:23:44.541 --> 00:23:45.875
That's so last decade.

190
00:23:53.416 --> 00:23:55.250
Finally, you're here.

191
00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:57.041
- Yes.
- How was the trip?

192
00:23:57.125 --> 00:23:58.916
- All good?
- Tiring.

193
00:23:59.458 --> 00:24:00.791
- Hi.
- Hi.

194
00:24:02.708 --> 00:24:03.958
Bro.

195
00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:06.958
What do you think?

196
00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:12.041
But it's authentic, isn't it?

197
00:24:12.125 --> 00:24:14.458
Yes. Authentic, that's right.

198
00:24:15.875 --> 00:24:17.208
I wonder who that is.

199
00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:21.833
- What do you think?
- Okay.

200
00:24:21.916 --> 00:24:22.958
Koh Chung Chung?

201
00:24:23.041 --> 00:24:25.375
- What's up, Koh?
- Salim.

202
00:24:25.458 --> 00:24:30.916
I've come to give you
Ci Fang Fang's praying tools.

203
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.583
I'll accept these.

204
00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:33.416
Thank you.

205
00:24:35.833 --> 00:24:37.875
Are you...

206
00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:40.083
going to spend the night here?

207
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.291
Yes.

208
00:24:44.666 --> 00:24:45.791
I see.

209
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.750
All right then.

210
00:24:47.833 --> 00:24:49.875
If you need anything,

211
00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:52.125
I live nearby.

212
00:24:52.208 --> 00:24:54.708
It's the little house
right next to the temple.

213
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.791
I'd better get going now.

214
00:24:58.875 --> 00:25:00.541
- Bye, everyone.
- Bye.

215
00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:03.583
- Bye.
- Thank you.

216
00:25:05.958 --> 00:25:07.000
Look at that box.

217
00:25:07.458 --> 00:25:08.833
It's so big.

218
00:25:17.333 --> 00:25:18.583
Nice.

219
00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:27.416
Is everyone ready? Let's do a house tour.

220
00:25:28.416 --> 00:25:29.875
Okay. Give me a second.

221
00:25:36.375 --> 00:25:39.708
Do you know the meaning
of any of these writings?

222
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:46.375
Hey.

223
00:25:51.458 --> 00:25:53.458
Hey. What's up?

224
00:25:53.958 --> 00:25:55.708
Nothing. Some water just dripped
on my head.

225
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:57.875
I'll fix it tomorrow.

226
00:25:57.958 --> 00:25:58.875
Let's go.

227
00:26:00.791 --> 00:26:03.333
- These are all antique ornaments.
- Beautiful, huh?

228
00:26:04.083 --> 00:26:06.041
So, my family

229
00:26:06.125 --> 00:26:09.666
has lived here since 1920-ish.

230
00:26:10.416 --> 00:26:12.000
Come on, Tasya.

231
00:26:12.916 --> 00:26:15.583
Just forget about your dream.

232
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.583
At times like this,

233
00:26:19.666 --> 00:26:20.833
the things you should remember

234
00:26:20.916 --> 00:26:23.500
are memories like
the first time you met Salim.

235
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.833
You used to tell me about him,
and you looked so freaking happy.

236
00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:31.333
Look at you now, marrying the guy.

237
00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:35.125
- Romantic, isn't it?
- Totally.

238
00:26:35.625 --> 00:26:37.166
Or you're just lucky.

239
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.958
But I think we need to do something
about your hair.

240
00:26:48.041 --> 00:26:49.083
Is that so?

241
00:26:50.458 --> 00:26:52.166
Why don't we just let my hair down?

242
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.500
No.

243
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.666
Isn't the hairdo amazing?

244
00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.333
Maybe I'll style her hair
like this tomorrow.

245
00:28:03.041 --> 00:28:05.166
I have enough hairpins.

246
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.666
I'll choose some that are good.

247
00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:09.375
That'll do.

248
00:28:10.166 --> 00:28:11.333
Okay.

249
00:28:11.416 --> 00:28:13.041
Geez, she is so beautiful.

250
00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:14.958
Is she your relative, Salim?

251
00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:16.458
If I'm not mistaken,

252
00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:19.333
she was my great-grandpa's younger sister.

253
00:28:19.958 --> 00:28:22.208
She was a famous singer in Central Java.

254
00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:23.375
Her name was Mei Hwa.

255
00:28:23.458 --> 00:28:24.666
Too bad...

256
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.958
- I heard she died young.
- She died?

257
00:28:31.083 --> 00:28:32.375
I think they kept them here somewhere,

258
00:28:33.208 --> 00:28:34.791
her record collections.

259
00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:36.250
Really?

260
00:28:37.375 --> 00:28:39.083
It would be so old.

261
00:30:17.541 --> 00:30:19.333
It gives me goosebumps.

262
00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:23.291
I think it'd be really good for dancing to.

263
00:30:23.375 --> 00:30:24.666
I agree.

264
00:30:57.791 --> 00:30:59.041
Where's the coffee?

265
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:03.916
This one?

266
00:31:04.791 --> 00:31:05.791
Yes.

267
00:31:40.791 --> 00:31:41.958
No.

268
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.416
I'm still saying no to being your model.

269
00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:47.083
What are you talking about?

270
00:31:48.958 --> 00:31:50.041
It's not that.

271
00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:52.541
What is it then?

272
00:31:56.083 --> 00:31:58.000
Salim beat me to it.

273
00:31:59.875 --> 00:32:02.541
Gosh, Febri. Go find yourself a girlfriend.

274
00:32:03.416 --> 00:32:05.041
You spend too much time fooling around.

275
00:32:05.125 --> 00:32:06.125
You don't know what I'm saying.

276
00:32:06.916 --> 00:32:08.208
That's not it.

277
00:32:19.375 --> 00:32:20.166
I...

278
00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:24.000
Used to like you too.

279
00:32:27.916 --> 00:32:29.166
Yeah, right.

280
00:32:31.333 --> 00:32:33.833
If you had liked me,

281
00:32:35.333 --> 00:32:36.875
you should've made a move.

282
00:32:43.833 --> 00:32:45.041
So,

283
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:47.875
if I had made my move,

284
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.541
would I still have a chance now?

285
00:32:57.458 --> 00:32:58.458
Nope.

286
00:32:59.416 --> 00:33:00.875
You smell like cigarettes.

287
00:33:03.333 --> 00:33:04.125
Tasya.

288
00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.083
Hang on.

289
00:33:08.458 --> 00:33:10.458
What's that?

290
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.791
Maybe...

291
00:33:27.375 --> 00:33:29.791
the cemetery of Salim's family.

292
00:33:42.083 --> 00:33:43.333
Okay.

293
00:35:29.833 --> 00:35:30.625
Salim.

294
00:37:16.583 --> 00:37:17.875
Honey?

295
00:37:18.708 --> 00:37:19.750
Salim.

296
00:37:19.833 --> 00:37:20.875
Salim.

297
00:37:23.833 --> 00:37:24.916
Why are you here?

298
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.416
Salim.

299
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.208
I don't know

300
00:37:28.291 --> 00:37:30.958
why they made a special altar
for Mei Hwa like this.

301
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.625
She should be at the front altar,

302
00:37:34.708 --> 00:37:36.458
along with other family members.

303
00:37:37.125 --> 00:37:38.291
Unless...

304
00:37:39.625 --> 00:37:40.916
Unless?

305
00:37:43.083 --> 00:37:44.666
She died as an unmarried woman.

306
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:47.791
For all I know,

307
00:37:47.875 --> 00:37:49.875
the prayer sticks on Mei Hwa's altar
must keep burning,

308
00:37:49.958 --> 00:37:52.375
and the one who lights them
must be a Tio family member.

309
00:37:53.541 --> 00:37:54.791
Otherwise, someone will get sick.

310
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.166
The nosebleed I had yesterday

311
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.333
is the same

312
00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:02.333
as the one that Engkim wrote about there.

313
00:38:10.375 --> 00:38:14.041
So, you have to live here?

314
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:20.041
And then when we have children,
when we get married, you...

315
00:38:20.125 --> 00:38:21.125
Honey.

316
00:38:22.708 --> 00:38:23.916
I understand if you...

317
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.416
if you can't take it,

318
00:38:26.666 --> 00:38:27.875
- it's okay.
- Salim.

319
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:29.333
Salim.

320
00:38:33.375 --> 00:38:35.458
We're in this together.

321
00:38:37.291 --> 00:38:38.375
Yes.

322
00:38:39.958 --> 00:38:41.041
Okay?

323
00:38:45.666 --> 00:38:47.041
Thank you, honey.

324
00:38:59.416 --> 00:39:01.041
You don't have to worry.

325
00:39:02.916 --> 00:39:05.625
What you experienced was maybe because

326
00:39:06.625 --> 00:39:07.875
the prayer sticks were out.

327
00:39:07.958 --> 00:39:10.708
Nobody lit them when Engkim died.

328
00:39:10.791 --> 00:39:11.833
Right?

329
00:39:12.291 --> 00:39:13.166
Yes.

330
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:16.333
Tomorrow, let's pray at Mei Hwa's grave.

331
00:39:18.416 --> 00:39:19.750
Hopefully,

332
00:39:20.666 --> 00:39:22.000
her spirit will find peace.

333
00:39:23.708 --> 00:39:25.000
- Yes.
- Okay?

334
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.833
Tell me if it hurts, Tasya.

335
00:39:42.208 --> 00:39:43.416
Tasya.

336
00:39:45.708 --> 00:39:47.000
I understand.

337
00:39:47.625 --> 00:39:50.083
What you experienced was so creepy.

338
00:39:51.625 --> 00:39:52.958
So...

339
00:39:55.458 --> 00:39:57.291
should we put this off?

340
00:40:00.333 --> 00:40:04.125
We can wait until you're feeling better,
and then we can...

341
00:40:04.208 --> 00:40:06.583
start everything all over again, and...

342
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.583
No.

343
00:40:10.333 --> 00:40:11.500
It's okay.

344
00:40:12.833 --> 00:40:14.625
My mood will improve soon.

345
00:40:16.125 --> 00:40:17.208
Are you sure?

346
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:21.791
Is everything ready?

347
00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:37.541
Let's go.

348
00:40:57.916 --> 00:40:58.833
Be careful.

349
00:41:01.791 --> 00:41:02.958
Be careful, Tasya.

350
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:27.750
Come here.

351
00:41:32.541 --> 00:41:33.625
Okay.

352
00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:36.458
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

353
00:41:36.541 --> 00:41:38.708
I'll head to the front yard.

354
00:41:38.791 --> 00:41:40.041
- Let's go.
- Okay.

355
00:41:40.125 --> 00:41:41.375
Let me do it.

356
00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:42.875
Okay.

357
00:41:43.916 --> 00:41:45.000
- All good?
- Yes.

358
00:41:58.333 --> 00:41:59.583
Where did you get this?

359
00:42:00.125 --> 00:42:01.250
It's a secret.

360
00:42:01.958 --> 00:42:03.250
Let me put it on you.

361
00:42:04.083 --> 00:42:05.333
Is it pretty?

362
00:42:19.583 --> 00:42:20.416
Gorgeous.

363
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.000
- Thank you, Arin.
- You're welcome.

364
00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:27.791
- Sorry.
- Make it flat.

365
00:42:27.875 --> 00:42:29.833
Don't smile?

366
00:42:30.333 --> 00:42:32.333
I want to make it this classic,
but I use film.

367
00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:34.291
- Now, I want you...
- You want left or right?

368
00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:36.250
- Left. You know that's my good side.
- Sorry, excuse me.

369
00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:37.958
This part of your face is so greasy.

370
00:42:38.041 --> 00:42:39.916
For this one, you can smile.

371
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.833
Should we show our teeth or not?

372
00:42:45.458 --> 00:42:46.250
Bud.

373
00:42:46.958 --> 00:42:48.625
Do you want me to make
your photos like this?

374
00:42:50.041 --> 00:42:51.291
Vintage style.

375
00:42:53.791 --> 00:42:55.666
I wasn't aware of this picture before.

376
00:42:57.916 --> 00:42:59.166
This is good.

377
00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:01.833
Okay. I'll do it.

378
00:43:04.083 --> 00:43:05.916
I'm taking behind-the-scenes pictures.

379
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.750
Now I'm using film.

380
00:43:13.583 --> 00:43:14.875
Look at me.

381
00:43:15.708 --> 00:43:18.000
Nice. Lower your chin, Tasya.

382
00:43:18.083 --> 00:43:19.291
One, two...

383
00:43:19.916 --> 00:43:22.750
Okay, now Salim,
show more affection towards Tasya.

384
00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:24.208
One, two.

385
00:43:25.041 --> 00:43:28.166
Okay. One more. Chin, down.
Relax, one, two.

386
00:43:30.958 --> 00:43:32.333
Okay, one, two.

387
00:43:35.833 --> 00:43:37.375
Eyes on me. One, two.

388
00:43:40.916 --> 00:43:43.708
One, two, this way.

389
00:43:48.791 --> 00:43:50.875
More love. One, two.

390
00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:54.625
Tasya, relax.

391
00:43:54.708 --> 00:43:56.291
One, two.

392
00:43:56.375 --> 00:43:58.583
Let go of my father.

393
00:44:00.166 --> 00:44:03.000
One more time. One, two.

394
00:44:05.166 --> 00:44:06.708
Okay.

395
00:44:06.791 --> 00:44:07.750
Hang on.

396
00:44:08.166 --> 00:44:09.708
- Tasya!
- Honey!

397
00:44:09.791 --> 00:44:11.250
- Honey.
- Tasya.

398
00:44:11.333 --> 00:44:13.041
- Tasya.
- Honey.

399
00:44:13.125 --> 00:44:14.208
- Wake up, Tasya.
- Honey.

400
00:44:14.291 --> 00:44:16.666
Are you sure you're not going to
take her to the hospital?

401
00:44:18.208 --> 00:44:19.333
Tasya doesn't want that.

402
00:44:20.666 --> 00:44:22.083
She says she just needs some rest.

403
00:44:22.958 --> 00:44:24.833
As long as she's fine.

404
00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.625
I need to go to the restroom.

405
00:46:13.958 --> 00:46:15.208
Have you printed them?

406
00:46:20.333 --> 00:46:21.083
Bro.

407
00:46:22.583 --> 00:46:23.750
This picture, bro.

408
00:46:25.375 --> 00:46:26.541
What's wrong?

409
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:46.583
- I'm going back to Jakarta.
- You can't.

410
00:46:46.666 --> 00:46:49.083
- You have to stay here, Harja.
- I can't, Arin.

411
00:46:49.166 --> 00:46:51.833
- Yes, but Tasya just fainted.
- I don't care.

412
00:46:51.916 --> 00:46:54.375
- This is driving me crazy, Arin.
- You can't leave, Harja.

413
00:46:54.458 --> 00:46:56.416
Your work is not done here.

414
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.458
- I see ghosts here.
- Yes, I know, but you need to calm down.

415
00:46:59.958 --> 00:47:02.083
I can't stay here any longer.

416
00:47:02.166 --> 00:47:03.791
Yes, but you have to listen to me first.

417
00:47:03.875 --> 00:47:06.041
We're here to help Tasya and Salim.

418
00:47:06.125 --> 00:47:08.375
- How could you leave...
- I don't want to help him.

419
00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:10.000
- I want to go back to Jakarta.
- Yes.

420
00:47:10.083 --> 00:47:12.875
There is a ghost
in Salim and Tasya's picture.

421
00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:15.625
Yes, Harja. Calm down.
Tasya just fainted.

422
00:47:15.708 --> 00:47:17.583
I don't care about Tasya.

423
00:51:50.416 --> 00:51:51.666
Honey.

424
00:51:53.458 --> 00:51:54.666
Be careful.

425
00:52:04.708 --> 00:52:06.083
Be careful, Tasya.

426
00:52:06.166 --> 00:52:07.291
Tasya.

427
00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:08.666
What's this?

428
00:52:11.291 --> 00:52:12.666
What is this?

429
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:14.083
I don't know.

430
00:52:31.666 --> 00:52:32.833
Salim.

431
00:53:13.166 --> 00:53:14.625
Mei Hwa.

432
00:53:27.166 --> 00:53:28.708
It's weird, bud.

433
00:53:28.791 --> 00:53:32.583
There's been a body buried behind the wall
for years and you don't know about it?

434
00:53:32.666 --> 00:53:34.041
Sorry, Febri. Hang on.

435
00:53:34.125 --> 00:53:36.541
Then who was buried
at the back of the house?

436
00:53:42.125 --> 00:53:43.125
I don't know.

437
00:53:44.333 --> 00:53:45.875
All I know

438
00:53:45.958 --> 00:53:50.791
is that I have to light the prayer sticks
on Mei Hwa's altar or I'll get sick.

439
00:53:53.458 --> 00:53:54.333
That's it.

440
00:53:55.166 --> 00:53:56.125
That's all I know.

441
00:54:00.833 --> 00:54:03.500
Tomorrow, we'll give Mei Hwa
a proper burial,

442
00:54:04.083 --> 00:54:05.875
and then we'll finish the photoshoot.

443
00:54:05.958 --> 00:54:06.791
What?

444
00:54:07.416 --> 00:54:09.750
Salim, you're crazy. No way.
We're going home tonight.

445
00:54:09.833 --> 00:54:11.083
Harja, calm down.

446
00:54:11.166 --> 00:54:13.041
I'm here to work,

447
00:54:13.125 --> 00:54:14.083
not to bury a body.

448
00:54:16.583 --> 00:54:17.791
You're right, Harja.

449
00:54:20.375 --> 00:54:22.416
This is mine and Salim's problem,

450
00:54:23.625 --> 00:54:24.875
not yours.

451
00:54:24.958 --> 00:54:26.833
No, Tasya. I'll help you.

452
00:54:26.916 --> 00:54:30.333
Even if it means burying a body,
I'll definitely help you.

453
00:54:30.416 --> 00:54:33.041
Okay, okay, let's bury the body now.

454
00:54:33.125 --> 00:54:34.041
- Come on.
- Not now.

455
00:54:34.125 --> 00:54:36.875
Burying the body at night
will only bring us more bad luck.

456
00:54:36.958 --> 00:54:39.750
- Let's just do it tomorrow.
- You're all unbelievable!

457
00:54:40.416 --> 00:54:41.708
Damn it.

458
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:42.791
Harja.

459
00:54:43.333 --> 00:54:44.416
Harja.

460
00:54:49.083 --> 00:54:50.083
Tasya.

461
00:54:51.041 --> 00:54:52.416
I'm going to get something to drink.

462
00:54:55.166 --> 00:54:56.250
Do you want anything?

463
00:54:57.666 --> 00:54:58.791
Okay.

464
00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:16.541
Hey, Harja.

465
00:55:16.625 --> 00:55:18.750
Where are you going? You're going
to leave in the middle of a job?

466
00:55:18.833 --> 00:55:20.791
My job doesn't include
burying a dead body.

467
00:55:20.875 --> 00:55:23.083
Yes, I know. But your job here
is not done yet.

468
00:55:23.166 --> 00:55:25.833
They should've taken care of it
before we started working.

469
00:55:27.833 --> 00:55:30.416
Besides, why don't you want
to come home with me?

470
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:33.958
- I feel bad for Tasya.
- Again, Tasya.

471
00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:35.750
Tasya is going to marry someone else.

472
00:55:35.833 --> 00:55:36.541
Are you nuts?

473
00:55:37.875 --> 00:55:38.916
Harja.

474
00:55:39.541 --> 00:55:40.666
Harja.

475
00:55:43.875 --> 00:55:44.958
Ugh!

476
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.375
Damn! Tasya?

477
00:57:17.833 --> 00:57:19.083
Tasya.

478
00:57:19.708 --> 00:57:21.000
Tasya.

479
00:57:21.083 --> 00:57:22.208
Tasya.

480
00:57:54.416 --> 00:57:55.500
Watch it.

481
00:58:02.875 --> 00:58:03.958
Honey.

482
00:58:09.208 --> 00:58:10.500
Be careful, Salim.

483
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:09.291
Tasya?

484
00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:32.708
Tasya.

485
00:59:38.791 --> 00:59:39.541
Tasya.

486
00:59:51.125 --> 00:59:52.958
Tasya, why are you smiling like that?

487
00:59:55.833 --> 00:59:56.625
Tasya.

488
00:59:58.083 --> 01:00:00.166
You're scaring me.

489
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:04.750
Tasya.

490
01:00:06.583 --> 01:00:07.458
Tasya.

491
01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:10.541
Tasya.

492
01:00:32.958 --> 01:00:34.041
Sir.

493
01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:35.791
Excuse me.

494
01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:37.666
Is Koh Chung Chung here?

495
01:00:44.125 --> 01:00:47.333
There's a strong energy out there.

496
01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:52.333
Grief.

497
01:00:54.333 --> 01:00:55.500
Sadness.

498
01:00:57.291 --> 01:00:59.875
But you can help my friend, right?

499
01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:05.291
The things that are happening to Salim are
unlike anything I've heard about before.

500
01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:08.666
But based on your story

501
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.000
and...

502
01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:13.958
my knowledge about that house,

503
01:01:15.583 --> 01:01:18.583
there's only one thing we can do.

504
01:01:19.958 --> 01:01:23.166
It was done here in the past,

505
01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:24.541
but...

506
01:01:24.625 --> 01:01:27.208
I myself have never done it.

507
01:01:28.541 --> 01:01:30.625
You'll help me, right?

508
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.125
Yes.

509
01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:36.458
Tasya.

510
01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:39.333
Let's leave.

511
01:01:40.291 --> 01:01:41.208
Tonight.

512
01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:43.250
Come with me, Tasya.

513
01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:45.708
Leave Salim.

514
01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:51.750
Are you drunk?

515
01:01:55.833 --> 01:01:56.791
No.

516
01:01:59.625 --> 01:02:00.583
I'm not drunk.

517
01:02:00.666 --> 01:02:02.666
I'm a hundred percent sober.

518
01:02:04.041 --> 01:02:08.291
I fully realize now
that I've made a huge mistake.

519
01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:11.500
And now I'm going to do what you said
I should have done yesterday.

520
01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:13.708
I'm going to make a move.

521
01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:17.416
I want you to be with me.

522
01:02:20.625 --> 01:02:22.250
I want to be with Salim.

523
01:02:24.666 --> 01:02:27.125
Tasya, open your eyes. Look around you!

524
01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:31.208
Do you really want to live with a man
with this kind of family background?

525
01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:33.000
Think, Tasya.

526
01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.166
Why did Salim move
the photoshoot location to this place?

527
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.375
And he didn't tell you
about his family history. Why?

528
01:02:38.458 --> 01:02:41.375
He wants to harm us and he doesn't
want us to get out of this place.

529
01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:42.500
- Open your eyes, Tasya!
- Febri.

530
01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:43.583
Febri, stop.

531
01:02:44.958 --> 01:02:46.208
I don't care.

532
01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:48.208
Whatever you think about Salim,

533
01:02:49.916 --> 01:02:51.875
I love him so much.

534
01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:55.208
And if he has to die
because of this matter...

535
01:02:57.541 --> 01:02:59.000
I want to die with him.

536
01:03:01.458 --> 01:03:05.333
Sorry. I may be wrong.
Maybe it's just in my head.

537
01:03:05.416 --> 01:03:07.000
But what I feel here, Tasya,

538
01:03:07.541 --> 01:03:09.375
I can't hold it in anymore.

539
01:03:09.458 --> 01:03:11.083
I no longer have the power to lie.

540
01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:12.500
I love you.

541
01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:18.916
You can never take his place in my heart.

542
01:03:43.541 --> 01:03:44.708
Salim.

543
01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:47.333
I'm sorry.

544
01:03:49.041 --> 01:03:51.333
You shouldn't have to go through this.

545
01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:53.125
It's my fault.

546
01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:54.416
What do you mean?

547
01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:57.166
As long as we're not married,

548
01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:00.416
you are not tied to me,

549
01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:02.958
nor to my family.

550
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:07.916
So if you want to leave now,
nothing will happen to you.

551
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.458
- Salim.
- Tasya, please listen to me.

552
01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:13.958
I don't want you to live a miserable life

553
01:04:14.541 --> 01:04:15.416
because of me.

554
01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:18.958
I love you so much.

555
01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:22.583
And you deserve to be happy.

556
01:04:23.166 --> 01:04:24.500
To travel the world

557
01:04:24.958 --> 01:04:27.958
and get everything that you think
you will get from me.

558
01:04:28.666 --> 01:04:29.666
So you'd better listen to Febri.

559
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:30.958
- Go with him.
- No, Salim.

560
01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:33.541
- Go with him now.
- Salim, stop.

561
01:04:34.916 --> 01:04:36.125
Don't...

562
01:04:36.208 --> 01:04:39.000
Don't you ever doubt my love for you.

563
01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:41.750
To get everything, you said?

564
01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:44.833
You're so naive

565
01:04:44.916 --> 01:04:47.083
if you think I can live a day without you.

566
01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:50.875
Do you think I want to see you die?

567
01:04:51.333 --> 01:04:52.666
Do you really think so?

568
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:56.833
- Salim, answer me.
- Tasya.

569
01:08:53.583 --> 01:08:55.625
One more week, honey.

570
01:08:55.708 --> 01:08:57.291
Are you ready?

571
01:08:57.708 --> 01:08:58.541
Here...

572
01:08:59.583 --> 01:09:01.416
I have a gift

573
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.791
for you.

574
01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:06.000
It's not something fancy,

575
01:09:06.083 --> 01:09:07.875
but I made it myself.

576
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.458
This butterfly

577
01:09:10.541 --> 01:09:14.000
is a symbol of my hope for you.

578
01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:17.916
I hope that you'll soar into the sky.

579
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.541
Thank you, honey.

580
01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:23.041
Let's soar together.

581
01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:27.208
Come here.

582
01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:28.666
Let me put it on you.

583
01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:41.000
It's beautiful.

584
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.208
- Run!
- Dad!

585
01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.208
Hurry!

586
01:10:02.291 --> 01:10:03.083
Hurry!

587
01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:05.666
Wait!

588
01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:07.541
Come on.

589
01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:09.416
Where should we go?

590
01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.291
- Look down!
- Mom!

591
01:10:14.666 --> 01:10:15.958
Shut up!

592
01:10:21.541 --> 01:10:23.208
Oh God...

593
01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:25.541
It's hard to hide while walking like this.

594
01:10:25.625 --> 01:10:27.291
What should we do?

595
01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:31.458
- Let's go.
- Oh God.

596
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.958
- Get in here.
- Let's get in here.

597
01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:37.791
Come inside.

598
01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:39.333
Come inside.

599
01:10:39.416 --> 01:10:41.833
Come inside.

600
01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:45.541
- Bhanu.
- Shut up.

601
01:11:01.833 --> 01:11:02.750
Come on!

602
01:11:10.958 --> 01:11:12.333
Get on your knees!

603
01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:18.125
Freedom or death!

604
01:11:23.791 --> 01:11:25.666
Get down!

605
01:11:36.416 --> 01:11:37.833
Freedom!

606
01:12:49.583 --> 01:12:50.916
Mei Hwa!

607
01:13:10.875 --> 01:13:13.250
Mei Hwa!

608
01:13:17.791 --> 01:13:19.916
Mom.

609
01:13:21.666 --> 01:13:25.458
Mom...

610
01:13:25.541 --> 01:13:28.166
Mom...

611
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.458
Mom...

612
01:14:00.375 --> 01:14:01.375
Tasya.

613
01:14:01.458 --> 01:14:02.375
What are you doing?

614
01:14:06.333 --> 01:14:07.833
Salim.

615
01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:10.375
It's okay.

616
01:14:10.458 --> 01:14:12.541
- Salim.
- It's okay, honey.

617
01:14:12.625 --> 01:14:14.041
I'm here.

618
01:14:17.625 --> 01:14:18.833
I'm sorry.

619
01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:25.500
Mei Hwa, Salim.

620
01:14:26.416 --> 01:14:29.541
Mei Hwa killed herself, Salim.

621
01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:32.375
She died following Bhanu.

622
01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.583
She stabbed her own neck, Salim.

623
01:14:53.333 --> 01:14:55.291
So, Mei Hwa killed herself.

624
01:15:00.416 --> 01:15:03.250
You were singing Mei Hwa's song, honey.

625
01:15:14.416 --> 01:15:16.541
Do you know what it means?

626
01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:21.875
<i>Butterfly</i>

627
01:15:23.916 --> 01:15:25.916
<i>Wailing and moaning</i>

628
01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:32.458
<i>Wherever my moon has gone</i>

629
01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:38.750
<i>Let my wings</i>

630
01:15:39.875 --> 01:15:41.666
<i>Flap strong</i>

631
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:44.125
<i>And reach your side again</i>

632
01:15:48.958 --> 01:15:50.208
Mei Hwa.

633
01:15:50.541 --> 01:15:51.875
It's okay, honey.

634
01:15:51.958 --> 01:15:53.250
I'm here.

635
01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:55.958
I'm sorry.

636
01:15:59.833 --> 01:16:01.791
She sang that song

637
01:16:02.541 --> 01:16:05.208
before she finally stabbed her own neck.

638
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:10.750
And from that moment,

639
01:16:11.625 --> 01:16:13.500
I was so sad

640
01:16:14.208 --> 01:16:15.416
that I...

641
01:16:18.458 --> 01:16:20.458
But why did you sing that song?

642
01:16:21.583 --> 01:16:22.833
One thing's for sure.

643
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.875
Now that I know the meaning of the song,

644
01:16:25.958 --> 01:16:29.208
I know that what Mei Hwa wanted
was to marry her fiancé,

645
01:16:29.291 --> 01:16:30.625
Bhanu.

646
01:16:32.708 --> 01:16:34.333
We have buried the body,

647
01:16:35.041 --> 01:16:36.791
and yet another problem has arisen.

648
01:16:36.875 --> 01:16:38.625
What scheme are you playing now, Salim?

649
01:16:39.541 --> 01:16:40.750
Tasya!

650
01:16:42.208 --> 01:16:44.500
Tasya, I know who can help us.

651
01:16:44.583 --> 01:16:45.458
Who is it, Arin?

652
01:16:45.541 --> 01:16:47.208
Just trust me.

653
01:16:50.541 --> 01:16:51.666
Salim.

654
01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:55.250
Is there really a ritual
to marry two spirits?

655
01:16:55.333 --> 01:16:56.958
Yes.

656
01:16:57.041 --> 01:17:01.416
And Arin and I have prepared

657
01:17:02.416 --> 01:17:04.958
everything we need for that ritual.

658
01:17:06.291 --> 01:17:11.916
So, a spirit wedding ceremony
can be done in two ways.

659
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.375
Marrying one spirit to another spirit,

660
01:17:15.458 --> 01:17:19.416
lovers who have died,

661
01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:24.208
or marrying one spirit with a human
who is still alive.

662
01:17:24.833 --> 01:17:25.958
That's nuts.

663
01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.458
Who would want to do it?

664
01:17:27.541 --> 01:17:29.041
I know some who would.

665
01:17:29.125 --> 01:17:32.416
Many people did it in that era because

666
01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:37.416
the son-in-law or daughter-in-law
would inherit their parents' fortune.

667
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
After that, they could marry
another person.

668
01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:47.208
Koh Chung Chung.

669
01:17:48.041 --> 01:17:49.708
What do we have to do now?

670
01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:53.791
Help me.

671
01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.166
Koh.

672
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.541
We put it here.

673
01:18:11.958 --> 01:18:13.333
This one.

674
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:14.833
Yes.

675
01:18:14.916 --> 01:18:16.166
All set.

676
01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:20.375
All rise.

677
01:19:23.208 --> 01:19:25.333
Wait.

678
01:19:26.958 --> 01:19:28.041
Wait a minute.

679
01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:33.208
Do it again.

680
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:06.875
What's wrong?

681
01:20:09.458 --> 01:20:11.750
I can't find Bhanu's spirit.

682
01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:15.000
What should we do?

683
01:20:15.083 --> 01:20:17.708
We have to find Bhanu's body.

684
01:20:17.791 --> 01:20:19.875
The Japanese threw away Bhanu's body.

685
01:20:20.666 --> 01:20:21.875
We don't know where it is.

686
01:20:24.208 --> 01:20:25.458
God.

687
01:20:25.541 --> 01:20:27.041
No wonder.

688
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:32.958
The body didn't get a proper burial
and nobody ever prayed for him.

689
01:20:33.041 --> 01:20:33.916
What should we do now?

690
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.833
We have to find something
that belonged to Bhanu.

691
01:20:42.833 --> 01:20:44.125
How about

692
01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:46.166
their wedding ring?

693
01:20:46.833 --> 01:20:47.583
Yes.

694
01:20:48.208 --> 01:20:52.125
If that's the case,
there's only one way to do it.

695
01:20:55.791 --> 01:20:59.083
But it is the most dangerous way and...

696
01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:01.250
it has to succeed.

697
01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:06.083
One of you has to bring Bhanu here
from the hereafter.

698
01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:09.875
- Hereafter?
- The rest of you will have a task to do.

699
01:21:09.958 --> 01:21:11.875
- But...
- I'll bring Bhanu here.

700
01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:13.500
No.

701
01:21:13.583 --> 01:21:14.833
Tasya.

702
01:21:14.916 --> 01:21:16.000
No.

703
01:21:17.041 --> 01:21:18.125
I'll go.

704
01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:20.208
I'm Mei Hwa's family.
I can look for Bhanu.

705
01:21:20.291 --> 01:21:23.166
- Come on, tell me how.
- Tasya.

706
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.625
Tasya, it's starting to feel creepy.

707
01:21:24.708 --> 01:21:28.125
- I'll do it.
- No, let me do it.

708
01:21:28.208 --> 01:21:29.583
Hang on.

709
01:21:29.958 --> 01:21:32.000
Do you even know what Bhanu looks like?

710
01:21:32.083 --> 01:21:34.250
If you go and look for him,

711
01:21:35.208 --> 01:21:36.833
will you recognize him?

712
01:21:39.625 --> 01:21:42.083
But it's dangerous, Tasya.
The hereafter. What the hell?

713
01:21:42.166 --> 01:21:45.666
I'm sorry, but I think Tasya is
the right person for this task.

714
01:21:46.166 --> 01:21:47.041
Sorry, Salim.

715
01:21:47.125 --> 01:21:49.291
If you go there,

716
01:21:49.375 --> 01:21:51.833
your ancestors may take you away.

717
01:21:51.916 --> 01:21:54.375
- That's fine.
- You won't be able to come back.

718
01:21:54.458 --> 01:21:55.791
No.

719
01:21:57.958 --> 01:21:59.083
Salim.

720
01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:01.333
Are you sure?

721
01:22:02.375 --> 01:22:04.208
This is not a game, Tasya.

722
01:22:05.458 --> 01:22:08.041
- What if you don't come back?
- Salim.

723
01:22:08.125 --> 01:22:09.416
What should I do?

724
01:22:11.625 --> 01:22:13.625
Trust me.

725
01:22:15.916 --> 01:22:17.208
I'm sure, Salim,

726
01:22:17.958 --> 01:22:20.083
that Mei Hwa will help me.

727
01:22:20.166 --> 01:22:21.875
This is what she wants, Salim.

728
01:22:22.541 --> 01:22:23.458
Okay?

729
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:30.666
What are the other tasks?

730
01:22:31.416 --> 01:22:32.791
<i>Arin,</i>

731
01:22:32.875 --> 01:22:34.625
<i>stay here</i>

732
01:22:34.708 --> 01:22:38.875
<i>and light the prayer sticks while praying.</i>

733
01:22:38.958 --> 01:22:41.375
<i>You can use your own words to pray.</i>

734
01:22:41.458 --> 01:22:44.291
<i>Ask permission from Salim's ancestors</i>

735
01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:46.166
<i>and pray</i>

736
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:49.958
<i>that their souls find peace
and that they will watch over us.</i>

737
01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.583
<i>Salim, Febri,</i>

738
01:22:53.666 --> 01:22:55.541
<i>go to Mei Hwa's grave</i>

739
01:22:55.625 --> 01:22:58.583
<i>and dig up her body.</i>

740
01:22:58.666 --> 01:23:01.166
<i>Be careful. Bring the body back here.</i>

741
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:04.750
<i>Make sure you bring
their wedding rings as well.</i>

742
01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:08.166
<i>The wedding rings are immensely important.</i>

743
01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:09.958
<i>Don't forget that.</i>

744
01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:12.833
Tasya,

745
01:23:12.916 --> 01:23:14.875
you're going to the hereafter.

746
01:23:15.875 --> 01:23:18.875
Call Bhanu.

747
01:23:19.916 --> 01:23:21.625
Although he can't see you,

748
01:23:21.708 --> 01:23:24.875
in the hereafter,
he will be able to hear you.

749
01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:26.208
He can come close to you.

750
01:23:26.666 --> 01:23:29.583
When you meet Bhanu,

751
01:23:29.666 --> 01:23:31.583
hold his hand

752
01:23:32.666 --> 01:23:36.333
and then burn this paper
with this mantra on it...

753
01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:41.666
using this match.

754
01:23:45.375 --> 01:23:46.291
Okay?

755
01:23:47.291 --> 01:23:48.750
Thank you for helping.

756
01:23:50.666 --> 01:23:52.208
I'm doing this for Tasya.

757
01:23:52.291 --> 01:23:53.625
I know.

758
01:23:56.041 --> 01:23:57.791
I heard everything you said to Tasya.

759
01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:01.833
You really are an ass.

760
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.208
Stay out of our lives from now on.

761
01:24:08.875 --> 01:24:09.916
You got that?

762
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:27.708
<i>In the hereafter,</i>

763
01:24:27.791 --> 01:24:29.625
you'll be safe.

764
01:24:29.708 --> 01:24:31.333
Just do one thing.

765
01:24:31.416 --> 01:24:34.666
When someone calls your name,

766
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.458
ignore them.

767
01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:39.125
Don't go closer to them,

768
01:24:39.208 --> 01:24:41.625
whoever they are.

769
01:24:42.708 --> 01:24:44.375
Now relax,

770
01:24:45.791 --> 01:24:47.041
close your eyes,

771
01:24:49.958 --> 01:24:52.125
exhale,

772
01:24:53.833 --> 01:24:57.333
and slowly lie down.

773
01:25:24.416 --> 01:25:25.708
Koh Chung Chung.

774
01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:18.000
Tasya.

775
01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:21.541
Tasya.

776
01:26:26.375 --> 01:26:29.875
- Tasya.
- Tasya.

777
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.208
- Tasya.
- Tasya.

778
01:26:37.541 --> 01:26:39.500
- Tasya.
- Tasya.

779
01:26:40.625 --> 01:26:43.250
- Tasya.
- Tasya.

780
01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:49.375
- Tasya.
- Tasya.

781
01:26:49.458 --> 01:26:53.625
- Tasya.
- Tasya.

782
01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:58.208
- Tasya.
- Tasya.

783
01:26:58.291 --> 01:27:00.916
Tasya.

784
01:27:02.416 --> 01:27:04.000
Bhanu!

785
01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:07.791
Febri, where's Salim? Febri, damn it!

786
01:27:07.875 --> 01:27:09.375
What's wrong with you?

787
01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:10.791
You...

788
01:27:10.875 --> 01:27:12.333
You leave this place now.

789
01:27:12.416 --> 01:27:13.333
I'm taking Tasya with me too.

790
01:27:13.416 --> 01:27:15.125
But Salim is still at the cemetery.

791
01:27:15.208 --> 01:27:16.833
Don't worry about Salim.

792
01:27:16.916 --> 01:27:18.166
He left us.

793
01:27:18.250 --> 01:27:20.333
- What do you mean?
- He doesn't care about us.

794
01:27:20.833 --> 01:27:22.958
Febri, I don't believe you.

795
01:27:23.833 --> 01:27:25.000
Salim.

796
01:27:25.833 --> 01:27:27.250
Salim.

797
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:29.291
Damn it.

798
01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:31.875
Salim.

799
01:27:31.958 --> 01:27:33.333
Salim.

800
01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:34.916
Salim, wake up.

801
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.083
Salim!

802
01:27:37.291 --> 01:27:39.041
Damn it.

803
01:27:39.875 --> 01:27:43.000
- Bhanu!
- Tasya.

804
01:27:43.083 --> 01:27:46.458
- Where are you, Bhanu?
- Tasya.

805
01:27:46.541 --> 01:27:49.625
- Mei Hwa is looking for you, Bhanu.
- Tasya.

806
01:27:49.708 --> 01:27:51.250
Tasya.

807
01:27:54.875 --> 01:27:55.750
Salim?

808
01:27:59.166 --> 01:28:00.250
Honey.

809
01:28:00.791 --> 01:28:03.833
Honey, don't leave me here alone.

810
01:28:04.833 --> 01:28:05.958
Honey.

811
01:28:06.041 --> 01:28:06.916
Tasya!

812
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.125
Tasya.

813
01:28:09.333 --> 01:28:10.541
Tasya.

814
01:28:12.125 --> 01:28:13.250
Tasya.

815
01:28:15.625 --> 01:28:17.250
Tasya.

816
01:28:17.791 --> 01:28:19.833
Tasya.

817
01:28:20.666 --> 01:28:24.833
Tasya.

818
01:28:26.166 --> 01:28:27.958
Tasya.

819
01:28:28.041 --> 01:28:30.625
- Bhanu.
- Tasya.

820
01:28:44.291 --> 01:28:46.083
I'm taking Tasya home.

821
01:28:46.166 --> 01:28:47.875
You can't do that.

822
01:28:53.041 --> 01:28:54.458
Tasya.

823
01:28:54.541 --> 01:28:55.791
Tasya.

824
01:28:55.875 --> 01:28:58.166
Tasya, wake up.

825
01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:00.333
Tasya, it's not safe here.

826
01:29:00.416 --> 01:29:02.250
Come one. Let's go home with me, Tasya.

827
01:29:02.333 --> 01:29:04.625
Tasya, wake up.

828
01:29:04.958 --> 01:29:07.166
Tasya, let's go home.

829
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:08.583
We're going home, Tasya.

830
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.708
Damn it.

831
01:29:26.416 --> 01:29:27.708
Honey.

832
01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:29.041
Honey, wake up.

833
01:29:29.458 --> 01:29:30.333
Wake up.

834
01:31:01.458 --> 01:31:02.750
Bhanu.

835
01:32:22.625 --> 01:32:23.916
Koh Chung Chung.

836
01:32:29.583 --> 01:32:30.833
Koh.

837
01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:43.875
Salim.

838
01:33:45.833 --> 01:33:47.458
Salim.

839
01:33:48.458 --> 01:33:50.083
Honey.

840
01:33:53.333 --> 01:33:54.625
Are you okay?

841
01:33:56.958 --> 01:33:58.625
Come on, help me.

842
01:33:58.708 --> 01:34:00.625
Salim, what are you doing?

843
01:34:00.708 --> 01:34:02.291
I'm going to marry Mei Hwa
and then go home.

844
01:34:02.375 --> 01:34:04.000
Why are you marrying her to Febri?

845
01:34:05.458 --> 01:34:06.708
Isn't this what she wants?

846
01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:07.875
To get married?

847
01:34:07.958 --> 01:34:08.875
No, Salim.

848
01:34:08.958 --> 01:34:12.625
Not like this. She wants to marry
Bhanu's spirit, not Febri.

849
01:34:13.666 --> 01:34:15.250
Tasya, listen.

850
01:34:16.125 --> 01:34:17.375
Don't you remember
what Koh Chung Chung said?

851
01:34:17.458 --> 01:34:18.958
This is not right, Salim.

852
01:34:19.041 --> 01:34:21.708
Mei Hwa wants to marry Bhanu's spirit,
not just any man.

853
01:34:21.791 --> 01:34:24.625
And I've found Bhanu's spirit.

854
01:34:24.708 --> 01:34:26.916
I've met him, Salim.

855
01:34:30.083 --> 01:34:31.166
Okay.

856
01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:33.208
How

857
01:34:33.291 --> 01:34:34.625
do we marry them?

858
01:34:35.708 --> 01:34:37.166
Koh Chung Chung is dead.

859
01:34:38.916 --> 01:34:40.500
I'm trying to use
Koh Chung Chung's way here.

860
01:34:40.583 --> 01:34:43.541
I'm not sure it's going to work,
but I'm going to try it anyway.

861
01:34:43.625 --> 01:34:45.166
So, please...

862
01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:46.541
help me.

863
01:34:47.041 --> 01:34:48.125
No, Salim.

864
01:34:49.958 --> 01:34:51.375
Not like this, Salim.

865
01:34:51.458 --> 01:34:55.083
Do you want me to stay here all my life
burning prayer sticks

866
01:34:55.166 --> 01:34:56.750
and pass the ritual to our child?

867
01:35:00.083 --> 01:35:01.416
Is that what you want?

868
01:35:55.916 --> 01:35:56.791
Damn it.

869
01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:58.791
Febri.

870
01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:05.166
You're a dead meat.

871
01:36:13.041 --> 01:36:15.958
Just go and join your ancestors.

872
01:36:18.875 --> 01:36:19.958
Stop!

873
01:36:57.333 --> 01:36:58.750
That's enough,

874
01:36:59.291 --> 01:37:01.458
stop this.

875
01:37:04.958 --> 01:37:06.166
Tasya.

876
01:37:09.333 --> 01:37:10.458
Tasya.

877
01:37:14.458 --> 01:37:17.500
But thank you.

878
01:37:20.625 --> 01:37:22.458
Tasya.

879
01:37:25.541 --> 01:37:27.541
I want my ring back.

880
01:37:41.708 --> 01:37:43.083
Tasya.

881
01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:45.041
Tasya.

882
01:37:46.166 --> 01:37:47.416
Tasya.

883
01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.333
Tasya!

884
01:37:50.833 --> 01:37:52.833
Febri, where's Tasya?

885
01:37:54.541 --> 01:37:55.625
Febri.
