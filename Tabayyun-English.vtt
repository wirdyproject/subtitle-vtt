4
00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:29.000
-Mom?
-Yes?

5
00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:32.000
I wonder what Dad would be doing
if he were still here.

6
00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:37.583
He's always here, Honey.

7
00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:40.083
Where?

8
00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:45.958
Here.

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.666
Dad's always here.

10
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.625
He's here with both of us.

11
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.041
Therefore…

12
00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:03.083
when you and I are happy,

13
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.250
Dad will be happy too.

14
00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:12.000
That's why…

15
00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:15.291
we must always be

16
00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:19.833
happy together!

17
00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:33.333
Sleep tight, my champ.

18
00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:36.208
Yes, pretty Mama! I love you!

19
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.916
Hey, Beautiful.

20
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.958
Why are you here?

21
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:27.458
Where's Mom?

22
00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:29.583
Stop it!

23
00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:33.666
Had I seen you first,
I wouldn't have married your mother!

24
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.083
-Get out!
-Shut up!

25
00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.000
Shut up!

26
00:02:37.708 --> 00:02:39.083
Go away!

27
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.583
No, hear me out.

28
00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:43.708
-You bastard!
-Ouch!

29
00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:55.875
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:58.208
Please forgive me.

31
00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:00.458
Forgive me.

32
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.000
Please forgive me…

33
00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:14.250
You must leave.

34
00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:17.416
You must leave now.

35
00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:21.041
Find Miss Tiwi. She's my friend.

36
00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:24.208
Go on with your life.

37
00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:26.958
Forget all this!

38
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:29.125
Zalina?

39
00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:34.625
Zalina! Look at me.

40
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.666
Don't ever look for me.

41
00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:39.166
Okay?

42
00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:49.750
Don't…

43
00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:55.791
RUMAH TEDUH ORPHANAGE

44
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.041
Zalina?

45
00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:08.291
Oh God, Zalina.

46
00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:16.916
-Did you do the homework?
-I did.

47
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.500
I did too.

48
00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:21.041
Good, you ate so much!

49
00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.291
-Take the plate to the sink.
-Yes, Miss.

50
00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:25.708
Let's go!

51
00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:10.333
Oh, Dear God.

52
00:07:10.416 --> 00:07:11.833
Oh, Dear God.

53
00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:30.125
Please help me!

54
00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:34.541
Oh my God, Zalina!

55
00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:38.291
-Oh my God, Zalina…
-Please help me!

56
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:48.750
Zalina?

57
00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:53.333
He's looking for you.

58
00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:56.041
He needs his mom!

59
00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:06.166
I've done my duty.

60
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:09.625
I don't want to see his face.

61
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.125
But, Zalina…

62
00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:16.083
Give him a name, at least.

63
00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:24.916
Get rid of him.

64
00:08:28.416 --> 00:08:30.250
Get rid of the baby.

65
00:08:31.666 --> 00:08:34.166
Oh my God, Zalina!

66
00:08:59.291 --> 00:09:00.291
Zal.

67
00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:05.625
Please, just this once.

68
00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:13.291
Consider this a farewell.

69
00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:18.375
I'll put him up for adoption.

70
00:09:36.708 --> 00:09:37.750
Zal.

71
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.083
Look at him.

72
00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:42.750
His name is Arka.

73
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.500
It means "the sun".

74
00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:51.000
There, there.

75
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.416
Zal…

76
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.791
Arka.

77
00:12:02.458 --> 00:12:03.583
Arka.

78
00:12:11.791 --> 00:12:13.375
Arka.

79
00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:29.541
I'm so sorry…

80
00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:36.416
Please forgive me.

81
00:12:40.708 --> 00:12:45.416
Dear God, please forgive my sins.

82
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.833
Please forgive my mother.

83
00:12:53.583 --> 00:12:57.708
God, please give me strength

84
00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:01.250
to raise my son, Arka.

85
00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:07.125
I want him to be good, religious,

86
00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:10.666
and full of joy.

87
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.833
As for my mom…

88
00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:25.166
Please protect her

89
00:13:25.875 --> 00:13:28.500
wherever she is now.

90
00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:34.291
Protect her always.

91
00:13:41.916 --> 00:13:45.416
I only pray to You.

92
00:14:02.333 --> 00:14:03.541
Mom…

93
00:14:48.416 --> 00:14:51.875
-Morning's here. Wake up!
-Alright…

94
00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958
Hey, wake up!

95
00:14:57.041 --> 00:14:59.541
-Don't just sleep all day!
-Okay.

96
00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:02.708
Wake up!

97
00:15:03.416 --> 00:15:06.416
-Come on, now.
-What time is it?

98
00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:09.375
It's already six o'clock!

99
00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:14.291
Oh Allah, bless us

100
00:15:14.375 --> 00:15:16.625
In what you have provided us

101
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:21.875
And protect us
From the punishment of the fire

102
00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.125
Amen

103
00:15:24.708 --> 00:15:26.541
Let's eat, everyone.

104
00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:28.791
-Thank you for the meal!
-Thank you for the meal!

105
00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:31.666
Eat as much as you want.

106
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.750
There's milk and eggs, too.

107
00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:44.625
Arka, I'm leaving for work, okay?

108
00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:47.541
Okay. Please don't be long.

109
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:51.333
Get me something too!

110
00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:53.791
Okay, Sweetie!

111
00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:56.791
-Peace be upon you.
-And you, too.

112
00:16:03.208 --> 00:16:04.791
Drink your milk.

113
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.125
Finish all of your meal.

114
00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:11.791
-Yes, Ma'am.
-Yes, Ma'am.

115
00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:16.000
For this month's rent.

116
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.958
Thank God.

117
00:16:20.666 --> 00:16:24.791
-May God always bring you kindness.
-Amen.

118
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.041
I'll forever be grateful
for you and this place.

119
00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:36.125
God has paved the way for you.

120
00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:40.041
Send my regards to Mrs. Samira.

121
00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:43.583
Yes, Ma'am.

122
00:16:45.666 --> 00:16:48.833
-I'm leaving now.
-Peace be upon you.

123
00:16:48.916 --> 00:16:50.250
Please take care.

124
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.083
-Morning, Miss Zalina.
-Morning.

125
00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:10.666
COME TOGETHER ADVERTISING

126
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:15.250
All this time,
this company has been accepting us!

127
00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:18.041
We've been doing a good job.

128
00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:20.000
Is this how you repay us?

129
00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:22.083
Mr. Irfan.

130
00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:23.166
What's happening?

131
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.333
There will be a massive layoff.

132
00:17:25.416 --> 00:17:29.541
Don't worry, we're not on the list.

133
00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:30.750
I think we're meant to be together.

134
00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:32.916
-Hush!
-We are the ones who did the work!

135
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.875
-You're prettier when you're angry.
-Hear, hear!

136
00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.875
You have a wife and kids!

137
00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.375
We, the employees,

138
00:17:42.458 --> 00:17:46.083
have been here since the very start

139
00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:47.375
but now you're throwing us away!

140
00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:49.416
-Hear, hear!
-Right!

141
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.291
We're hurt!

142
00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:53.916
My husband just retired.

143
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.416
My kids need a vacation!

144
00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.458
Calm down.

145
00:17:58.541 --> 00:18:02.791
Now their dreams are shattered!

146
00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:03.916
Hear, hear!

147
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.041
Marni, you're being laid off too?

148
00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:09.041
I've worked here for decades.

149
00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:12.250
Since I was a young girl,
now I'm an adult.

150
00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:17.541
And now I'm being let go.
Imagine how I feel!

151
00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:19.958
Mrs. Samira never told me anything.

152
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:22.583
Not Mrs. Samira, but her son.

153
00:18:22.666 --> 00:18:24.583
He just returned from Australia.

154
00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:28.833
He just came and cut employees off.
How arrogant!

155
00:18:28.916 --> 00:18:30.250
Her son?

156
00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:32.750
-Alright…
-Miss Zalina.

157
00:18:32.833 --> 00:18:37.750
Please talk to Mrs. Samira.
She'll listen to you.

158
00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:39.250
Please help us.

159
00:18:39.333 --> 00:18:42.333
Alright, I'll talk to her.

160
00:18:42.416 --> 00:18:43.875
Thank you!

161
00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:49.083
Arlo, look what you've done!

162
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.458
Mom, you asked me to save this company.

163
00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:54.958
This is how it's done.

164
00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:57.708
It's in everything I learned.

165
00:18:57.791 --> 00:18:59.583
Efficiency is key.

166
00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:05.083
I've filtered out everything
deemed too outdated.

167
00:19:21.916 --> 00:19:23.625
Peace be upon you.

168
00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:27.375
Zalina, this is my son, Arlo.

169
00:19:29.416 --> 00:19:31.708
-Arlo.
-Zalina.

170
00:19:32.708 --> 00:19:33.875
Come in.

171
00:19:38.666 --> 00:19:42.208
How's the situation?
I could hear Marni from here.

172
00:19:42.291 --> 00:19:44.208
Should we add more security?

173
00:19:44.291 --> 00:19:46.458
Pardon my rudeness, Ma'am.

174
00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:49.958
I can't let my colleagues lose their job.

175
00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:53.333
Most of them are breadwinners.

176
00:19:53.416 --> 00:19:56.083
This is the best way for this company.

177
00:19:57.916 --> 00:20:00.208
Mr. Arlo, isn't there another way?

178
00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:04.833
Well, this is the quickest way.

179
00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:09.875
I've worked here for three years

180
00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:12.333
and I care about this place.

181
00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:15.583
I've talked to you about my ideas.

182
00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:17.625
Zalina.

183
00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:22.166
This company was built
since I got married.

184
00:20:22.708 --> 00:20:25.833
This may be the same age as yours!

185
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.666
Are you going to change its whole history?

186
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.625
I want to change its future,
not its history.

187
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.583
Have you got ideas?

188
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.666
How about a rebranding?

189
00:20:46.708 --> 00:20:50.958
Excuse me,
but the company name is outdated.

190
00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:59.875
See? I told you, Mom. Old-school!

191
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.333
Continue.

192
00:21:04.916 --> 00:21:06.083
Well…

193
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.708
How about we change its name

194
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.541
into Happy Together?

195
00:21:12.625 --> 00:21:13.875
No.

196
00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:15.916
Together Advertising?

197
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.333
The meaning is still the same
as Come Together.

198
00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:22.333
We can also change our target market

199
00:21:22.416 --> 00:21:26.833
to gen alphas, gen Z, and millennials.

200
00:21:26.916 --> 00:21:30.791
Those three are dominating
every business line.

201
00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:37.458
Maybe we can try that first.

202
00:21:40.041 --> 00:21:41.708
Arlo, what do you think?

203
00:21:43.708 --> 00:21:47.041
Up to you, Mom. It's your company.

204
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.666
You decide everything.

205
00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:54.416
Well, then.

206
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.500
You and Zalina can work
on this rebranding.

207
00:21:58.375 --> 00:22:02.083
Why me? It's her idea.

208
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:05.500
You know I'm building my own company.

209
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:10.416
Do it later. Now you have to fix this!

210
00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:26.000
Here comes the troublemaker!

211
00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:28.833
Handsome devil!

212
00:22:28.916 --> 00:22:30.416
Heartless bastard!

213
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.083
Silence.

214
00:22:32.583 --> 00:22:36.666
I'm telling all of you,
there will be no layoffs.

215
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.208
Hooray!

216
00:22:40.291 --> 00:22:41.541
Yeah…

217
00:22:41.625 --> 00:22:44.208
Now, the first thing to do is

218
00:22:44.791 --> 00:22:49.250
we'll rebrand this company
into Together Advertising.

219
00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:50.958
-Wow…
-Lead by--

220
00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:51.958
Listen.

221
00:22:52.041 --> 00:22:56.041
Lead by my son, Arlo, and Miss Zalina.

222
00:22:56.125 --> 00:23:00.208
It's fine. At least Zalina will help.

223
00:23:00.291 --> 00:23:01.916
Now get back to work.

224
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.041
-Thank you, Ma'am!
-Thank you.

225
00:23:07.583 --> 00:23:10.291
Our effort paid off!

226
00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:13.416
Miss Zalina is so cool!

227
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.958
Did you see how Arlo glanced at her?

228
00:23:17.041 --> 00:23:18.458
There's something.

229
00:23:18.541 --> 00:23:20.666
A lovey-dovey glance!

230
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:21.833
We'll see.

231
00:23:21.916 --> 00:23:26.166
The vicious boss
will be tamed by his master.

232
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.041
Miss Zalina!

233
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.416
Thank you so much.

234
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.083
I've never once doubted you!

235
00:23:33.166 --> 00:23:36.750
I knew you'd fight for us!

236
00:23:36.833 --> 00:23:39.083
-Thank you!
-You're welcome.

237
00:23:39.166 --> 00:23:41.083
Yes.

238
00:23:41.875 --> 00:23:43.375
Well, well…

239
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.583
Whatever…

240
00:23:45.666 --> 00:23:49.958
Allah Almighty speaks the truth.

241
00:23:50.041 --> 00:23:53.875
Children, that's it for today.
See you tomorrow.

242
00:23:53.958 --> 00:23:56.333
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

243
00:23:58.333 --> 00:24:01.375
Come on.

244
00:24:09.416 --> 00:24:13.333
-Mom!
-Arka!

245
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:20.750
-Mom, you just arrived?
-Yes, Honey.

246
00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:22.375
Are you tired?

247
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.666
My back is a little sore.

248
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.458
Let me massage you!

249
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:35.541
When I grow up, let me do all the work.

250
00:24:35.625 --> 00:24:39.833
You just stay at home and enjoy your days.

251
00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:45.833
Let me do it because you need some rest.

252
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:51.833
Arka, I feel so much better now.

253
00:24:51.916 --> 00:24:53.500
Thank you, my love!

254
00:24:53.583 --> 00:24:54.583
You're welcome.

255
00:24:59.708 --> 00:25:01.708
You're the best, Mom!

256
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:16.958
Here are options for the new logo
for Together Advertising.

257
00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:20.791
Send the file to my e-mail.

258
00:25:28.583 --> 00:25:31.583
You work fast. I like you.

259
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
I learned a lot from Mrs. Samira.

260
00:25:41.041 --> 00:25:43.208
Can we catch up with the timeline?

261
00:25:46.291 --> 00:25:48.000
Well, yes…

262
00:25:48.083 --> 00:25:51.208
but we have to work late.

263
00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:05.125
-She's asking him to work late.
-Wow.

264
00:26:05.208 --> 00:26:07.833
-I sense danger.
-Oh no.

265
00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:09.625
She looks innocent.

266
00:26:09.708 --> 00:26:12.958
I never knew she could be so aggressive.

267
00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:19.041
Innocent-looking people
are more dangerous.

268
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Working late?

269
00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:34.833
Let me take you home.

270
00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:40.041
Irfan, you know I always go home alone.

271
00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:43.791
You keep playing hard to get, huh?

272
00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:47.416
I just want to get to know you better.

273
00:26:48.958 --> 00:26:52.000
Listen, please stop bothering me.

274
00:26:52.833 --> 00:26:54.250
-I'm not--
-Hey.

275
00:26:55.666 --> 00:26:57.666
Did you hear her?

276
00:26:58.583 --> 00:27:00.166
Talk to her one more time

277
00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:02.708
and you'll get a warning from HR.

278
00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:06.708
Mr. Arlo, no need to involve HR.

279
00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:09.333
I was just kidding! Right, Zal?

280
00:27:09.416 --> 00:27:11.625
I must leave now. Excuse me.

281
00:27:11.708 --> 00:27:12.916
Okay, goodnight.

282
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.333
Goodnight, Mr. Arlo.

283
00:27:15.416 --> 00:27:17.291
Damn it!

284
00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:22.208
It wasn't here few hours ago.

285
00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:28.875
Thank you, Sir.

286
00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:32.791
I thought he'd never stop bothering me.

287
00:27:34.708 --> 00:27:37.541
Let me know if he does it again.

288
00:27:45.458 --> 00:27:47.000
Let me take you home.

289
00:27:52.166 --> 00:27:55.125
It's okay, I can go home alone.

290
00:27:55.208 --> 00:27:57.666
I don't want to bother you.

291
00:27:59.666 --> 00:28:01.500
It will bother me more

292
00:28:01.583 --> 00:28:05.041
if you get sick and can't go to work.

293
00:28:05.125 --> 00:28:07.541
It will ruin our work timeline.

294
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:14.041
What if Irfan suddenly follows you home

295
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.416
and disturbs you outside the office?

296
00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:42.625
RUMAH TEDUH ORPHANAGE

297
00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:06.666
Thank you, Sir. See you tomorrow.

298
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.208
Peace be upon you.

299
00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:11.833
I want to stop by.

300
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
My mother donates to this orphanage.

301
00:29:19.583 --> 00:29:22.000
I want to look around.

302
00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:29.291
I'm home.

303
00:29:29.375 --> 00:29:31.541
Welcome home, Mom!

304
00:29:37.416 --> 00:29:39.708
Did you get me anything?

305
00:29:39.791 --> 00:29:42.666
Oh no, I forgot!

306
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.375
-Oh…
-I'm so sorry!

307
00:29:46.916 --> 00:29:49.250
Who's that guy behind you?

308
00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:55.583
This is Mr. Arlo, my boss.

309
00:29:57.083 --> 00:29:58.291
He's my son.

310
00:29:59.458 --> 00:30:00.875
Hello!

311
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.875
-I'm Arlo.
-I'm Arka.

312
00:30:04.875 --> 00:30:06.500
Did you get me anything?

313
00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:08.833
Arka!

314
00:30:10.791 --> 00:30:12.041
Arka!

315
00:30:13.208 --> 00:30:16.708
I didn't bring anything today.

316
00:30:16.791 --> 00:30:19.916
When I return, I promise you

317
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.083
I'll bring a lot of gifts for you.

318
00:30:25.166 --> 00:30:27.541
-Promise?
-Promise.

319
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.541
-You're so cute.
-Thanks.

320
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.375
Well then, I'm off.

321
00:30:50.958 --> 00:30:52.458
Arka looks sleepy.

322
00:30:54.125 --> 00:30:55.416
Thanks for the ride.

323
00:30:56.875 --> 00:30:59.500
Since it's Friday,

324
00:30:59.583 --> 00:31:00.833
have a nice weekend.

325
00:31:02.416 --> 00:31:03.541
Peace be upon you.

326
00:31:03.625 --> 00:31:05.416
-Peace be upon you.
-And you too.

327
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:08.166
-Bye, Arka!
-Bye, Uncle Arlo!

328
00:31:17.416 --> 00:31:19.583
Mom, Uncle Arlo seems nice.

329
00:31:21.875 --> 00:31:23.000
Let's go.

330
00:31:39.875 --> 00:31:43.958
-Peace be upon you, Mama Samira!
-And you too.

331
00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:45.291
Arum!

332
00:31:47.541 --> 00:31:50.000
Here, I have cakes for you.

333
00:31:50.958 --> 00:31:52.666
Thank you.

334
00:31:53.416 --> 00:31:56.333
You look so pretty!

335
00:31:57.625 --> 00:32:00.125
You've grown into a woman.

336
00:32:01.083 --> 00:32:03.583
That's so nice of you.

337
00:32:03.666 --> 00:32:06.708
You also look pretty, Mama Samira.

338
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:10.083
Look at you. Your aura is glowing!

339
00:32:10.166 --> 00:32:11.750
Oh, stop it.

340
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.541
I'm mad at Arlo.

341
00:32:14.625 --> 00:32:16.458
He ruined my work.

342
00:32:17.583 --> 00:32:19.000
Arlo…

343
00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:21.791
Where is he?

344
00:32:22.708 --> 00:32:25.166
No idea. He left so early.

345
00:32:27.666 --> 00:32:31.500
Let's just sit here and chat.

346
00:32:32.125 --> 00:32:36.708
I want to continue our conversation.

347
00:32:38.916 --> 00:32:40.916
Would you like to help me in the company?

348
00:32:42.875 --> 00:32:45.000
Don't act like you don't know me.

349
00:32:45.666 --> 00:32:47.416
Of course!

350
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.541
Anything I can do for you and Arlo

351
00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:52.625
I'll do it with all my heart!

352
00:32:53.666 --> 00:32:55.166
Thank God.

353
00:32:56.125 --> 00:32:57.750
Thank you, Sweetie.

354
00:32:58.541 --> 00:33:00.333
You've helped me so much.

355
00:33:01.125 --> 00:33:04.583
Without your help, I'm pretty sure

356
00:33:05.291 --> 00:33:09.250
Arlo wouldn't have graduated from college.

357
00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:11.041
Not really!

358
00:33:11.625 --> 00:33:13.916
-I'm home.
-That's him.

359
00:33:15.041 --> 00:33:16.500
Welcome home!

360
00:33:17.916 --> 00:33:19.000
Arlo!

361
00:33:20.041 --> 00:33:21.083
Arum?

362
00:33:25.458 --> 00:33:27.208
I miss you.

363
00:33:34.958 --> 00:33:37.000
Where do you work now?

364
00:33:37.083 --> 00:33:38.750
I haven't worked yet.

365
00:33:38.833 --> 00:33:42.000
I was looking for a job and, by chance,

366
00:33:42.083 --> 00:33:45.125
Mama Samira asked me to work with you.

367
00:33:45.708 --> 00:33:48.333
Mom, why didn't you tell me first?

368
00:33:50.375 --> 00:33:52.333
You've known each other for so long.

369
00:33:52.416 --> 00:33:55.666
You went to the same college
and lived in the same building.

370
00:33:56.333 --> 00:33:58.708
And you don't want an old-school team,
do you?

371
00:33:59.416 --> 00:34:03.375
She's right. It's me!
You don't mind, do you?

372
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:07.125
-Or do you hate it?
-It's not like that.

373
00:34:07.208 --> 00:34:09.958
I'm just surprised seeing you here.

374
00:34:14.458 --> 00:34:16.208
I like seeing you two.

375
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.750
I pray that you will end up together.

376
00:34:21.833 --> 00:34:24.541
I'll leave this company to you someday.

377
00:34:25.583 --> 00:34:26.875
Mama…

378
00:34:56.333 --> 00:34:57.458
Here!

379
00:34:59.333 --> 00:35:00.291
Arka!

380
00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:02.208
Uncle Arlo!

381
00:35:03.833 --> 00:35:06.875
Look what I brought for you!

382
00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:09.666
These are for you guys.

383
00:35:11.958 --> 00:35:13.125
Let's play!

384
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.375
Pick your ball.

385
00:35:24.916 --> 00:35:26.125
Catch.

386
00:35:28.291 --> 00:35:29.416
Okay.

387
00:35:40.291 --> 00:35:41.541
Mom!

388
00:35:47.208 --> 00:35:49.333
Want to see Mom?

389
00:35:49.416 --> 00:35:50.875
-Yes.
-Let's go!

390
00:36:00.833 --> 00:36:04.375
Mom, Uncle Arlo brought so many balls.

391
00:36:06.791 --> 00:36:08.291
What do you say?

392
00:36:08.375 --> 00:36:11.416
Thank you, Uncle Arlo. You're the best!

393
00:36:12.375 --> 00:36:14.625
You're welcome, Arka.

394
00:36:18.333 --> 00:36:19.416
Arka.

395
00:36:21.125 --> 00:36:22.833
You can continue playing.

396
00:36:22.916 --> 00:36:24.708
-Okay!
-I'll catch up later.

397
00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:27.166
-Okay, bye!
-Bye.

398
00:36:43.416 --> 00:36:44.625
What's wrong, Zal?

399
00:36:52.208 --> 00:36:54.541
Please don't be offended.

400
00:36:59.833 --> 00:37:02.541
I don't think
you should come by too often.

401
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.541
Why not?

402
00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:09.041
Am I not allowed
to bring gifts to the children?

403
00:37:09.958 --> 00:37:13.375
Am I wrong for making Arka happy?

404
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.750
I don't want him to hope too much.

405
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.416
He's an innocent kid.

406
00:37:26.541 --> 00:37:28.041
He knows nothing.

407
00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:33.291
I don't understand.

408
00:37:38.333 --> 00:37:39.791
Since he was born…

409
00:37:41.875 --> 00:37:43.875
he's lost his father.

410
00:37:49.708 --> 00:37:53.166
Every time a man acts friendly to Arka,

411
00:37:54.833 --> 00:37:56.666
he'll think they're his dad.

412
00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:01.583
I don't want him to expect too much.

413
00:38:09.208 --> 00:38:10.416
I'm sorry.

414
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.208
I know how he feels.

415
00:38:20.708 --> 00:38:21.791
Well…

416
00:38:22.958 --> 00:38:27.208
I've never seen my dad since I was little.

417
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.125
You must have known my mother's story.

418
00:38:38.875 --> 00:38:40.375
Out there,

419
00:38:40.958 --> 00:38:46.333
she's a successful
and powerful single mom.

420
00:38:46.416 --> 00:38:47.958
Everybody knows her.

421
00:38:50.125 --> 00:38:51.291
But at home,

422
00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:56.791
she fails…

423
00:39:00.541 --> 00:39:03.375
She fails to understand her only son

424
00:39:05.833 --> 00:39:07.833
who misses a father figure.

425
00:39:17.583 --> 00:39:19.250
I'm just afraid

426
00:39:20.125 --> 00:39:23.250
that someday Arka might suffer like me.

427
00:39:25.916 --> 00:39:27.083
That's all.

428
00:39:34.208 --> 00:39:35.333
Excuse me.

429
00:39:41.333 --> 00:39:42.458
Arka!

430
00:39:45.541 --> 00:39:46.541
Uncle Arlo!

431
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.708
Pass the ball.

432
00:40:09.166 --> 00:40:11.416
-I'm home.
-Welcome home.

433
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.500
Arlo.

434
00:40:13.666 --> 00:40:16.250
You've been out all day.

435
00:40:16.875 --> 00:40:18.375
Where have you been?

436
00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:21.500
I wanted you to accompany Arum.

437
00:40:22.083 --> 00:40:23.250
Mom.

438
00:40:24.375 --> 00:40:28.291
Why do I always have to follow your wish?

439
00:40:29.458 --> 00:40:33.541
Not everything goes
the way you want it to.

440
00:40:34.875 --> 00:40:39.125
A mother knows best for her children.

441
00:40:39.208 --> 00:40:41.041
Including separating me from Dad?

442
00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:43.166
Is that what you mean?

443
00:40:46.791 --> 00:40:48.916
I don't want to talk about it.

444
00:40:49.833 --> 00:40:51.708
I want to talk about Arum.

445
00:40:53.541 --> 00:40:54.625
But, Mom…

446
00:40:55.375 --> 00:40:57.458
Arum is my best friend.

447
00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.625
She's like a sister to me.

448
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.625
-Nothing more.
-Arlo.

449
00:41:04.208 --> 00:41:05.500
Respect her.

450
00:41:05.583 --> 00:41:08.000
I know what you mean.

451
00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:11.041
But you can't force a feeling.

452
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.208
You can.

453
00:41:14.916 --> 00:41:17.375
Try to open your heart up.

454
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.000
I don't want you to disappoint

455
00:41:23.625 --> 00:41:25.083
and hurt Arum.

456
00:41:29.458 --> 00:41:30.708
Alright.

457
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.541
I'm tired. I'm going to my room.

458
00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.708
It's done.

459
00:41:46.875 --> 00:41:48.125
Let's hope for the best.

460
00:41:48.208 --> 00:41:53.666
I hope our team work
gets the best results.

461
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.833
-Amen.
-Amen.

462
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.916
My work here is done.

463
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.166
Now I'll focus on my own work.

464
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.791
What do you mean?

465
00:42:03.875 --> 00:42:06.166
Our work isn't over yet!

466
00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:07.875
This is barely the surface.

467
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.750
Stop saying nonsense.

468
00:42:09.833 --> 00:42:12.625
I need to talk to both of you.

469
00:42:12.708 --> 00:42:13.583
I'll be in my office.

470
00:42:25.375 --> 00:42:27.000
-Surprise!
-Arum?

471
00:42:31.458 --> 00:42:34.750
Arum, this is Zalina, our project manager.

472
00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:38.458
Zalina, this is Arum.

473
00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:40.833
She and Arlo went to the same college
back in Australia.

474
00:42:41.833 --> 00:42:44.041
Arum will work here

475
00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:46.333
and lead the digital media division.

476
00:42:49.416 --> 00:42:51.833
-Zalina.
-Arum.

477
00:42:51.916 --> 00:42:54.375
I hope we can work well together.

478
00:42:56.125 --> 00:42:59.833
Zalina, you can take her
around the office.

479
00:42:59.916 --> 00:43:00.750
Yes, Ma'am.

480
00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:03.958
-Let me show you your office.
-Okay, Mama.

481
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:05.416
I'll see you later!

482
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.000
Zalina, can I talk to you?

483
00:43:20.666 --> 00:43:22.541
Here you go.

484
00:43:22.625 --> 00:43:24.875
Thanks. Sorry to bother you.

485
00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:26.583
No, it's okay.

486
00:43:30.041 --> 00:43:31.625
Is it good?

487
00:43:32.208 --> 00:43:33.083
Yes.

488
00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:38.750
What do you want to tell me?

489
00:43:38.833 --> 00:43:41.916
I've got work to do.

490
00:43:45.541 --> 00:43:46.666
Here's the thing.

491
00:43:49.083 --> 00:43:50.041
How's Arka?

492
00:43:51.416 --> 00:43:54.333
I thought of him recently.

493
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.916
If you let me,

494
00:43:57.833 --> 00:43:59.833
I want to take him somewhere.

495
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.583
I don't think it's a good idea.

496
00:44:08.125 --> 00:44:09.208
Excuse me.

497
00:44:11.166 --> 00:44:14.708
Thank you for the office tour, Zalina.

498
00:44:14.791 --> 00:44:16.291
You're welcome.

499
00:44:17.791 --> 00:44:20.083
Let me introduce you.

500
00:44:20.166 --> 00:44:24.625
This is Marni, Melly, and Dila.

501
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.708
-Hello everyone.
-Hello.

502
00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:32.250
Anyway, Mama Mir…

503
00:44:32.333 --> 00:44:35.083
I mean Mrs. Samira.

504
00:44:35.166 --> 00:44:37.500
She told me to learn from you.

505
00:44:37.583 --> 00:44:39.916
It should be the other way around.

506
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.125
You went to college abroad!

507
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:47.208
But your experience can't be bought
with any diploma.

508
00:44:47.916 --> 00:44:52.416
Anyway,
my first client here is from Japan.

509
00:44:53.166 --> 00:44:54.500
You can help me, right?

510
00:44:54.583 --> 00:44:56.750
Me, you, and Arlo.

511
00:44:56.833 --> 00:44:59.500
Together we'll make the best team!

512
00:44:59.583 --> 00:45:00.833
Excuse me.

513
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:04.166
Look at her.

514
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:05.750
I know, right?

515
00:45:21.583 --> 00:45:23.333
What are you doing?

516
00:45:23.416 --> 00:45:25.291
I want to change my clothes.

517
00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:27.666
Are you going somewhere?

518
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.875
I want to go out!

519
00:45:29.958 --> 00:45:32.458
-With who?
-Uncle Arlo.

520
00:45:33.541 --> 00:45:34.708
Arlo?

521
00:45:56.958 --> 00:45:58.125
Arlo.

522
00:45:58.875 --> 00:45:59.916
Hey.

523
00:46:01.375 --> 00:46:03.083
I told you.

524
00:46:04.541 --> 00:46:06.500
I can't allow him to go.

525
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:15.791
Uncle, let's go!

526
00:46:18.083 --> 00:46:19.250
Honey.

527
00:46:19.791 --> 00:46:21.750
We can't go today.

528
00:46:21.833 --> 00:46:24.291
-I'm so busy right now.
-Mom!

529
00:46:24.375 --> 00:46:29.041
If you're busy,
then I'll just go with him.

530
00:46:35.208 --> 00:46:36.500
Arka.

531
00:46:36.583 --> 00:46:38.541
We'll go next time, okay?

532
00:46:38.625 --> 00:46:40.625
I want to go now!

533
00:46:44.666 --> 00:46:45.666
Zalina.

534
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.250
Okay, I'll go get ready.

535
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.000
Hooray!

536
00:47:02.083 --> 00:47:04.458
You seem so excited!

537
00:47:05.625 --> 00:47:06.750
Arka.

538
00:47:06.833 --> 00:47:10.875
I'll take you somewhere
with plenty of toys!

539
00:47:28.208 --> 00:47:29.458
Hello.

540
00:47:41.583 --> 00:47:43.000
It's crowded here.

541
00:47:43.583 --> 00:47:45.916
Yes, it's the weekend.

542
00:47:46.625 --> 00:47:49.208
That's not what I mean.

543
00:47:53.125 --> 00:47:56.625
It's usually just the two of us.
Now we have Uncle Arlo.

544
00:47:59.416 --> 00:48:01.250
Arka,

545
00:48:01.333 --> 00:48:02.875
Mom,

546
00:48:02.958 --> 00:48:04.875
and Dad!

547
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:12.416
Come here. You're really cute!

548
00:48:13.416 --> 00:48:15.208
-Uncle Arlo.
-Yes?

549
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:19.208
Can I call you "Dad"?

550
00:48:23.333 --> 00:48:24.208
Of course!

551
00:48:25.333 --> 00:48:28.125
Yay, I have a dad!

552
00:48:34.041 --> 00:48:35.625
Arka, Honey.

553
00:48:37.291 --> 00:48:39.875
Uncle Arlo is not your dad.

554
00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:42.291
So don't call him Dad, okay?

555
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:45.791
But, Mom…

556
00:48:45.875 --> 00:48:47.791
Alright…

557
00:49:08.166 --> 00:49:09.375
Hey!

558
00:49:14.208 --> 00:49:16.791
I remember the first time I met you.

559
00:49:19.333 --> 00:49:23.458
You boldly told my mother
that her company was outdated.

560
00:49:28.125 --> 00:49:30.583
Since then, I see you as someone special.

561
00:49:32.916 --> 00:49:34.916
You're a hard worker.

562
00:49:36.125 --> 00:49:37.375
And…

563
00:49:38.541 --> 00:49:40.125
You do everything for Arka.

564
00:49:45.666 --> 00:49:47.250
It's nothing special.

565
00:49:47.875 --> 00:49:51.750
Mrs. Samira also worked hard to raise you.

566
00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:56.125
To my mother,

567
00:49:57.208 --> 00:50:00.375
I was born to live under her rules.

568
00:50:03.916 --> 00:50:05.458
When I met Arka,

569
00:50:06.583 --> 00:50:10.458
for the first time
I felt needed as a whole.

570
00:50:16.625 --> 00:50:19.083
When I'm with both of you,

571
00:50:21.625 --> 00:50:23.083
I feel comfort.

572
00:50:25.208 --> 00:50:27.083
It feels like home.

573
00:50:30.625 --> 00:50:32.000
Yeah.

574
00:50:32.083 --> 00:50:33.791
I feel like I'm at home.

575
00:50:47.666 --> 00:50:50.916
Mom, look at my drawing!

576
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.041
Wow, this is so good!

577
00:50:56.416 --> 00:50:57.750
-Is this me?
-Yep.

578
00:50:58.833 --> 00:51:00.583
-Where's my hair?
-You're bald.

579
00:51:00.666 --> 00:51:01.875
Oh, no!

580
00:51:02.416 --> 00:51:04.416
It's pouring.

581
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.583
What do we do, Mom?

582
00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:21.541
Does anyone need an umbrella taxi?

583
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:25.791
Me! Me! Me!

584
00:51:26.958 --> 00:51:28.041
Let's go.

585
00:51:28.125 --> 00:51:31.083
Isn't it too small? I can wait here.

586
00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.791
Hold up.

587
00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:41.208
Okay, now we can go together.

588
00:51:46.333 --> 00:51:47.750
Walk slowly.

589
00:51:51.166 --> 00:51:52.500
Careful, it's slippery.

590
00:51:56.625 --> 00:51:57.916
Zalina!

591
00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:00.583
Just hold my arm.

592
00:52:21.541 --> 00:52:22.958
I'm home.

593
00:52:23.041 --> 00:52:25.083
Welcome home.

594
00:52:25.166 --> 00:52:27.666
My favorite grandson!

595
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.416
Looks like he had so much fun.

596
00:52:31.375 --> 00:52:32.500
Let me take him.

597
00:52:35.458 --> 00:52:36.625
Let's sleep.

598
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:41.291
He's so heavy.

599
00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:43.458
I'll take him to his room.

600
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-You're welcome.

601
00:52:52.708 --> 00:52:54.208
Thank you very much.

602
00:52:54.875 --> 00:52:57.000
Arka had so much fun today.

603
00:52:57.083 --> 00:52:58.291
Anytime.

604
00:53:00.375 --> 00:53:01.833
I should go now.

605
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:03.833
Okay, me too.

606
00:53:10.541 --> 00:53:11.708
Zalina.

607
00:53:16.875 --> 00:53:18.416
I want you to be honest.

608
00:53:23.416 --> 00:53:25.833
Do you have any feelings toward me?

609
00:53:36.333 --> 00:53:38.583
You haven't known me.

610
00:53:44.333 --> 00:53:46.125
I don't deserve you.

611
00:53:47.291 --> 00:53:49.958
You and Arka…

612
00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:53.041
Both of you deserve love.

613
00:53:54.666 --> 00:53:57.708
I can protect you and make you happy.

614
00:53:57.791 --> 00:53:59.708
And for Arka too!

615
00:54:02.708 --> 00:54:05.666
Arka and I are happy with this.

616
00:54:10.333 --> 00:54:12.000
Let's just be friends.

617
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.041
You didn't answer me.

618
00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:22.750
Be honest.

619
00:54:23.666 --> 00:54:26.625
Don't you have
even the slightest feeling for me?

620
00:54:28.125 --> 00:54:29.625
What do you feel?

621
00:54:34.458 --> 00:54:35.416
I…

622
00:54:42.541 --> 00:54:44.791
When I'm with you,

623
00:54:46.291 --> 00:54:47.708
I'm happy.

624
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.166
I feel comfort.

625
00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:57.208
And you're so kind to Arka.

626
00:54:59.333 --> 00:55:02.000
Arka cares so much about you.

627
00:55:05.333 --> 00:55:09.791
But you and I, we're not equal.

628
00:55:11.791 --> 00:55:14.666
We're not going anywhere.

629
00:55:16.708 --> 00:55:17.708
And…

630
00:55:21.083 --> 00:55:23.916
All that remains is pain.

631
00:55:29.083 --> 00:55:31.041
-Zalina…
-Arlo.

632
00:55:37.083 --> 00:55:39.000
We're not equal.

633
00:55:43.875 --> 00:55:45.125
The way I see it,

634
00:55:46.416 --> 00:55:49.125
you and Arum are perfect together.

635
00:55:50.625 --> 00:55:54.791
Mrs. Samira loves Arum so much.

636
00:55:59.708 --> 00:56:01.416
But this is my life.

637
00:56:02.791 --> 00:56:06.458
Only I know what makes me happy.

638
00:56:29.375 --> 00:56:30.583
This is for you.

639
00:56:32.791 --> 00:56:34.333
This is to remind you

640
00:56:35.416 --> 00:56:38.208
that you're the only woman I love.

641
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.333
Please take this.

642
00:56:51.208 --> 00:56:52.583
I'm off.

643
00:56:54.166 --> 00:56:55.666
Take care.

644
00:57:06.958 --> 00:57:08.458
I'm home.

645
00:57:09.833 --> 00:57:10.708
Arlo?

646
00:57:11.541 --> 00:57:14.041
Did you forget your dinner with Arum?

647
00:57:15.916 --> 00:57:18.875
-Hi!
-Sorry, I'm sweating so much.

648
00:57:18.958 --> 00:57:20.083
Go have a shower.

649
00:57:49.333 --> 00:57:53.333
What's recently popular among young women?

650
00:57:54.083 --> 00:57:55.416
Anti-aging products,

651
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.958
supported with a healthy lifestyle.

652
00:57:59.041 --> 00:58:01.291
-Right, Zalina?
-I agree.

653
00:58:02.583 --> 00:58:04.416
Men want that too.

654
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.416
We want to live long and look young.

655
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.250
That's even better!

656
00:58:10.333 --> 00:58:13.083
I have an idea for the campaign.

657
00:58:13.166 --> 00:58:16.791
A woman and a man know each other
since junior high school.

658
00:58:16.875 --> 00:58:21.083
Later they date
and go to the same college,

659
00:58:21.166 --> 00:58:22.791
and finally they get married!

660
00:58:22.875 --> 00:58:26.916
They have kids and grow old together.

661
00:58:27.958 --> 00:58:29.750
What do you think, Zalina?

662
00:58:32.125 --> 00:58:34.041
I think it's great.

663
00:58:34.125 --> 00:58:35.958
You're really creative.

664
00:58:37.166 --> 00:58:38.083
Arlo.

665
00:58:38.666 --> 00:58:40.666
How about we become the campaign model?

666
00:58:43.875 --> 00:58:45.625
Are you sure?

667
00:58:45.708 --> 00:58:47.708
Of course! What do you think?

668
00:58:52.875 --> 00:58:55.250
Pat my head.

669
00:59:06.916 --> 00:59:09.458
Which logo is the best?

670
00:59:09.541 --> 00:59:11.583
All of them look good.

671
00:59:11.666 --> 00:59:13.958
I think this is the best one.

672
00:59:14.041 --> 00:59:15.083
This one?

673
00:59:16.458 --> 00:59:17.583
You're right.

674
00:59:18.208 --> 00:59:19.041
Arlo.

675
00:59:19.125 --> 00:59:23.750
Among these three,
which one looks good to you?

676
00:59:26.125 --> 00:59:27.875
-This one.
-Really?

677
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:31.750
You and Zalina have the same taste!

678
00:59:32.791 --> 00:59:35.708
Okay, I'll pick this one.

679
00:59:35.791 --> 00:59:37.916
I hope everything goes well.

680
00:59:41.375 --> 00:59:42.666
Drive safely.

681
00:59:46.541 --> 00:59:48.875
You can stay if you want.

682
00:59:48.958 --> 00:59:50.083
-Okay.
-Okay.

683
00:59:50.583 --> 00:59:51.833
Send my regards.

684
00:59:55.333 --> 00:59:57.833
Is it okay if we stay a bit longer?

685
00:59:57.916 --> 01:00:00.208
I need to prepare for my presentation.

686
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:03.208
-It's okay. Let me help you.
-Yes.

687
01:00:09.416 --> 01:00:10.958
Here's your coffee.

688
01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:13.583
Thank you, Zalina.

689
01:00:18.166 --> 01:00:20.041
Do you live with anyone?

690
01:00:21.541 --> 01:00:23.291
With my son.

691
01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:25.375
You have a son?

692
01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:28.083
Yes, his name is Arka.

693
01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:29.666
He's five years old.

694
01:00:32.208 --> 01:00:34.250
What does your husband do for a living?

695
01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:39.583
He's passed away.

696
01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:48.208
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

697
01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:51.958
So you're a single mom.

698
01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:56.041
You must be a very strong woman.

699
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:58.875
I admire you.

700
01:00:59.541 --> 01:01:01.208
As for me…

701
01:01:02.416 --> 01:01:06.833
For me, there is no other man

702
01:01:07.416 --> 01:01:08.541
than Arlo.

703
01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.375
From junior high school to college,

704
01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:14.875
Arlo and I have been very close.

705
01:01:16.041 --> 01:01:19.166
Arlo's mother and my mother
are best friends.

706
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:20.875
We went to the same school.

707
01:01:20.958 --> 01:01:23.375
Arlo used to skip school a lot,

708
01:01:23.458 --> 01:01:25.750
I was the one doing his homework!

709
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.791
You're both perfect together.

710
01:01:29.583 --> 01:01:31.000
You complete each other.

711
01:01:32.666 --> 01:01:36.958
I have always imagined

712
01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:41.708
a life with Arlo, forever,

713
01:01:41.791 --> 01:01:42.666
as well as with Mama Samira.

714
01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:51.708
But lately I feel
something different about him.

715
01:01:54.125 --> 01:01:55.625
It's like he changed.

716
01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:09.458
I pray that you meet a great man

717
01:02:10.666 --> 01:02:13.166
to be your soulmate forever
in this world and heaven.

718
01:02:13.916 --> 01:02:16.416
Amen to that!

719
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.416
Thank you.

720
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:21.333
I pray that you and Arka are always happy.

721
01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:24.250
Amen.

722
01:02:34.791 --> 01:02:38.041
Let's hope our presentation goes well.

723
01:02:38.125 --> 01:02:39.166
Amen.

724
01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:44.666
I like your brooch!

725
01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:49.041
It really suits you.

726
01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:53.791
Through this campaign,
we want to raise awareness

727
01:02:53.875 --> 01:02:55.958
about healthy lifestyles from a young age.

728
01:02:57.083 --> 01:03:02.083
With this, we also hope
So that people can live longer lives.

729
01:03:02.166 --> 01:03:03.875
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

730
01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:05.041
Thank you!

731
01:03:27.041 --> 01:03:31.708
Mr. Handa said
he's happy with your presentation.

732
01:03:31.791 --> 01:03:35.750
Your approach is fresh,
unlike other agencies.

733
01:03:35.833 --> 01:03:38.958
So Timura Japan would like
to draw a contract

734
01:03:39.041 --> 01:03:40.958
with Together Advertising.

735
01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:42.333
Thank God.

736
01:03:43.041 --> 01:03:45.208
-Okay.
-Thank you.

737
01:03:45.291 --> 01:03:47.791
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

738
01:03:47.875 --> 01:03:49.958
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

739
01:03:59.583 --> 01:04:01.250
I rarely give compliments.

740
01:04:01.333 --> 01:04:03.875
But this time I have to admit

741
01:04:04.583 --> 01:04:06.791
that you're all really great.

742
01:04:07.625 --> 01:04:12.041
I'm glad that Together Advertising
now has a golden team.

743
01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:14.041
Right?

744
01:04:15.583 --> 01:04:18.000
Arum, Arlo.

745
01:04:19.416 --> 01:04:21.458
I have no doubt.

746
01:04:22.375 --> 01:04:23.875
When you get married,

747
01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:27.500
I'll leave this whole company to you.

748
01:04:33.916 --> 01:04:34.958
Zalina.

749
01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:39.416
Please keep supporting them. Okay?

750
01:04:40.458 --> 01:04:41.500
Yes, Ma'am.

751
01:04:45.333 --> 01:04:46.333
Okay.

752
01:04:47.958 --> 01:04:51.166
Zalina moves pretty fast.

753
01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:53.916
She'll get a pay raise,

754
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.375
promotion, and married!

755
01:04:56.458 --> 01:04:57.541
-Huh?
-What?

756
01:04:58.208 --> 01:04:59.833
With who?

757
01:04:59.916 --> 01:05:02.750
Who else? Surely not with Irfan.

758
01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:04.666
Watch it.

759
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:09.000
Now, whose side are you on?
Zalina or Arum?

760
01:05:09.083 --> 01:05:13.500
I'm on Zalina's side.

761
01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:16.041
She really deserves happiness.

762
01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:20.125
I'm clearly on Arum's side.

763
01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:24.541
There's no way Arlo chooses
a secondhand woman.

764
01:05:24.625 --> 01:05:27.291
-I can't imagine!
-You're right.

765
01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:32.750
I'm fine either way
as long as we get a pay raise.

766
01:05:32.833 --> 01:05:36.250
-That's right!
-Mrs. Samira!

767
01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:38.750
Mrs. Samira!

768
01:05:39.916 --> 01:05:41.000
Oh, no.

769
01:05:41.833 --> 01:05:44.125
Why are you talking like that?

770
01:05:46.833 --> 01:05:48.208
What do you mean?

771
01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:52.833
Marni.

772
01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:57.500
I was talking about
secondhand clothes with Melly.

773
01:05:57.583 --> 01:05:58.833
Don't lie.

774
01:05:59.375 --> 01:06:01.875
I'm new to this company

775
01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:05.083
but I've been watching all of you.

776
01:06:05.833 --> 01:06:07.166
I know you.

777
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:11.166
You like to pretend to work
but get nothing done.

778
01:06:12.666 --> 01:06:15.083
This company needs more effort

779
01:06:15.166 --> 01:06:18.166
to rise from its downfall!

780
01:06:19.416 --> 01:06:23.250
When the company tried
to do massive layoffs,

781
01:06:23.916 --> 01:06:27.000
did any of you
actually talk to Mrs. Samira

782
01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:28.916
to fight for the employees?

783
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.166
You didn't, did you?

784
01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:34.375
Zalina did all of those things.

785
01:06:35.833 --> 01:06:37.583
You should realize.

786
01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:39.833
When one finger points at someone,

787
01:06:39.916 --> 01:06:43.166
the other four are pointed at yourself.

788
01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:48.000
You should thank Zalina.

789
01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.833
Is this how you repay her?

790
01:06:53.541 --> 01:06:55.125
Marni, apologize.

791
01:06:57.458 --> 01:07:00.208
Zalina, I'm sorry

792
01:07:00.291 --> 01:07:04.750
for talking behind your back.

793
01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:07.625
Do it right, Marni.

794
01:07:07.708 --> 01:07:09.750
-Irfan.
-Yes, Ma'am.

795
01:07:09.833 --> 01:07:12.041
I know what you've been doing.

796
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:15.291
You like to hit on Zalina, don't you?

797
01:07:16.208 --> 01:07:19.208
You have a wife and kids.

798
01:07:19.291 --> 01:07:20.291
You should be ashamed!

799
01:07:22.791 --> 01:07:25.583
Don't start a family if you can't commit.

800
01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:30.500
Apologize to Zalina.

801
01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:37.125
I sincerely apologize, Zalina.

802
01:07:37.208 --> 01:07:39.208
Make sure it doesn't happen again.

803
01:07:39.291 --> 01:07:40.791
Noted.

804
01:07:42.416 --> 01:07:44.416
Get back to work.

805
01:07:54.958 --> 01:07:58.125
-It's all your fault.
-No it's not!

806
01:08:00.125 --> 01:08:02.583
-Arlo?
-Please wait.

807
01:08:04.416 --> 01:08:05.583
Coming.

808
01:08:12.708 --> 01:08:15.333
-What's up?
-Why did you lock the door?

809
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.041
I was in a meeting with a client.

810
01:08:21.833 --> 01:08:23.083
I see.

811
01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:26.583
I made you coffee.

812
01:08:27.833 --> 01:08:28.833
Just take it.

813
01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:32.000
I'm having coffee with friends.

814
01:08:33.958 --> 01:08:35.375
They're all waiting for me now.

815
01:08:38.708 --> 01:08:40.333
Are you working overtime?

816
01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.791
Sorry, I can't stay longer.

817
01:08:52.208 --> 01:08:53.458
Well, I'm off.

818
01:08:54.041 --> 01:08:56.125
-Bye.
-Bye.

819
01:10:58.083 --> 01:11:00.291
Mom, do you miss Uncle Arlo?

820
01:11:29.375 --> 01:11:30.375
Arum?

821
01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:32.708
Mama…

822
01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:51.666
What's wrong, Arum?

823
01:11:57.291 --> 01:12:00.375
There's something I want to tell you.

824
01:12:06.333 --> 01:12:07.375
Mama Samira.

825
01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:11.625
I am so grateful

826
01:12:12.333 --> 01:12:14.333
because all this time

827
01:12:15.791 --> 01:12:21.625
you've always loved me
like I'm your own daughter.

828
01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:27.958
I also care so much about you.

829
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:33.416
I think of you like my own mother.

830
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.166
I even…

831
01:12:41.416 --> 01:12:47.166
I've always thought
we could be a real family.

832
01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:49.250
What do you mean?

833
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.041
It's Arlo.

834
01:12:56.708 --> 01:12:59.041
What's with him?

835
01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:01.541
Did he hurt you?

836
01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:08.541
No, not at all.

837
01:13:15.041 --> 01:13:18.375
He's always been kind to me.

838
01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:25.875
And I know…

839
01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:30.166
He also cares about me.

840
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:38.250
But he doesn't love me.

841
01:13:43.708 --> 01:13:45.708
I am a woman

842
01:13:49.166 --> 01:13:51.875
who's always been in his life.

843
01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:03.916
But I've never been in his heart.

844
01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:16.916
Mama Samira.

845
01:14:18.583 --> 01:14:21.166
I'll always care for you.

846
01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:27.208
I hope nothing changes between us.

847
01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:36.791
I'll always wish him the best.

848
01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:42.000
Mama, I'm so sorry.

849
01:14:51.875 --> 01:14:53.125
I'm home.

850
01:14:56.083 --> 01:14:59.375
Arlo, we need to talk.

851
01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:10.666
What's wrong?

852
01:15:12.083 --> 01:15:14.583
I know about you and Zalina.

853
01:15:15.833 --> 01:15:17.541
Why her?

854
01:15:18.166 --> 01:15:19.875
She's a widow with a son.

855
01:15:20.875 --> 01:15:23.250
And you choose her over Arum?

856
01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:28.125
It's not about choice.

857
01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:31.000
It's about my happiness.

858
01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:35.583
I'm happy if I can make
Zalina and Arka happy.

859
01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.125
What are you thinking?

860
01:15:38.208 --> 01:15:40.208
That kid isn't your responsibility!

861
01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:43.833
I know, Mom.

862
01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:49.666
My only responsibility is your happiness.

863
01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.208
Isn't it?

864
01:15:54.833 --> 01:15:57.333
But you never ask if I'm happy.

865
01:15:58.833 --> 01:16:00.833
Are you not happy?

866
01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:05.166
I've done everything just for you.

867
01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:07.416
What else are you looking for?

868
01:16:08.208 --> 01:16:10.333
What do you get from Zalina?

869
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:14.708
Mom.

870
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:19.833
I've never thought, even in the slightest,

871
01:16:20.666 --> 01:16:22.833
to get something from her.

872
01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:27.875
I just want to give her happiness

873
01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:30.250
and a better life…

874
01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:35.583
I'm happy when I'm with them.

875
01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.791
But I know who she really is.

876
01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:41.750
She's got a shady past.

877
01:16:44.875 --> 01:16:48.041
Love really makes a fool out of anyone.

878
01:16:51.083 --> 01:16:53.916
Tabayyun, Mom.

879
01:16:55.708 --> 01:16:58.250
You should find out the truth.

880
01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:35.708
-Zalina.
-Yes?

881
01:17:35.791 --> 01:17:37.416
I want to talk with you.

882
01:17:38.041 --> 01:17:38.958
Come with me.

883
01:17:55.416 --> 01:17:56.541
Zalina.

884
01:17:58.791 --> 01:18:01.208
Let's talk as fellow women

885
01:18:02.166 --> 01:18:03.708
and fellow mothers.

886
01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:14.291
I've learned about you and Arlo.

887
01:18:15.916 --> 01:18:18.083
You've crossed the line

888
01:18:18.166 --> 01:18:20.166
and barged into my family.

889
01:18:22.375 --> 01:18:25.208
You've ruined
Arlo and Arum's relationship.

890
01:18:27.083 --> 01:18:28.125
Mom!

891
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:32.833
If anything, I'm the one to blame.

892
01:18:32.916 --> 01:18:34.625
I started everything.

893
01:18:35.583 --> 01:18:36.875
See?

894
01:18:37.666 --> 01:18:40.833
My son has lost his mind

895
01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:43.208
because he fell too hard for you.

896
01:18:50.708 --> 01:18:53.958
Do you feel the same way?

897
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.250
Do you love him?

898
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.208
I…

899
01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:20.250
I love him.

900
01:19:28.416 --> 01:19:32.000
But I know I can't be with him.

901
01:19:35.166 --> 01:19:37.041
I always pray

902
01:19:38.416 --> 01:19:40.833
that he meets his soulmate someday.

903
01:19:48.125 --> 01:19:49.833
But it's not me.

904
01:19:51.541 --> 01:19:52.708
Yes.

905
01:19:54.125 --> 01:19:56.833
You don't belong in my family.

906
01:19:56.916 --> 01:19:58.333
Stop it, Mom.

907
01:20:05.541 --> 01:20:06.458
I…

908
01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:12.625
I hate to see both of you
fall out because of me.

909
01:20:14.541 --> 01:20:17.250
I'll stay away from Arlo.

910
01:20:18.375 --> 01:20:22.416
It's easier to run
when you have something to hide.

911
01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:31.166
I need to hear it from you.

912
01:20:36.166 --> 01:20:38.083
Who are you, really?

913
01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:42.666
Who is your father?

914
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:45.208
Who is your mother?

915
01:20:46.666 --> 01:20:48.500
And who's the father of your son?

916
01:20:49.333 --> 01:20:51.458
Mom, that's enough.

917
01:20:51.541 --> 01:20:53.000
I don't care!

918
01:20:54.666 --> 01:20:57.000
I love her the way she is

919
01:20:57.083 --> 01:20:59.125
despite her past.

920
01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:02.541
You're the one suggesting Tabayyun

921
01:21:03.333 --> 01:21:05.166
to reveal the truth.

922
01:21:06.416 --> 01:21:09.333
If you can't face the truth,

923
01:21:09.416 --> 01:21:10.916
you better leave now.

924
01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:24.125
I'll tell you everything

925
01:21:26.916 --> 01:21:28.541
and I won't hide anything.

926
01:21:40.458 --> 01:21:41.583
My mother…

927
01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:45.666
is Laras Anindita.

928
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:54.083
People may look down on her

929
01:21:55.375 --> 01:21:57.291
or see her as garbage.

930
01:21:58.833 --> 01:22:00.125
A morally corrupt person.

931
01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:02.791
Why hello.

932
01:22:13.583 --> 01:22:16.208
Honey.

933
01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:19.875
For once,
I want to have fun with your daughter.

934
01:22:19.958 --> 01:22:24.875
-I'm bored of you.
-Don't you dare.

935
01:22:24.958 --> 01:22:28.291
-Stop it.
-Okay, let's go.

936
01:22:28.375 --> 01:22:29.416
Come on.

937
01:22:30.583 --> 01:22:31.916
Walk slower.

938
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.041
To me, my mother is my hero.

939
01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:39.875
My guardian angel.

940
01:22:45.291 --> 01:22:47.708
GRADUATED

941
01:22:48.458 --> 01:22:50.833
We had dreams together.

942
01:22:55.875 --> 01:23:01.833
We wanted to have a better future.

943
01:23:03.333 --> 01:23:04.500
Hey, Mom.

944
01:23:07.166 --> 01:23:08.458
Hey!

945
01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:10.666
What are you doing?

946
01:23:11.458 --> 01:23:12.875
Don't you even dare.

947
01:23:13.833 --> 01:23:15.041
But you do it.

948
01:23:16.583 --> 01:23:19.916
I work hard all day just for you.

949
01:23:20.833 --> 01:23:22.333
You need to be successful!

950
01:23:22.875 --> 01:23:26.000
Even though your father left us,

951
01:23:26.083 --> 01:23:30.208
I can send you to college.

952
01:23:32.166 --> 01:23:35.875
You must pursue your dreams

953
01:23:37.291 --> 01:23:39.750
and we'll have a better life together.

954
01:23:45.666 --> 01:23:46.666
Alright, Mom.

955
01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:52.666
I promise you.

956
01:24:02.416 --> 01:24:03.583
Mom…

957
01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:08.333
And then, one night…

958
01:24:10.833 --> 01:24:13.916
My stepfather raped me.

959
01:24:25.125 --> 01:24:28.125
All of my dreams fell apart.

960
01:24:32.791 --> 01:24:34.291
My mother went mad.

961
01:24:37.125 --> 01:24:39.541
She killed him right away.

962
01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:45.333
Oh, dear God.

963
01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:51.541
Oh, dear God.

964
01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:55.166
It's worse than I thought.

965
01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:58.958
I promise,

966
01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:03.750
I'll stay away from both of you.

967
01:25:06.375 --> 01:25:10.541
This is also my resignation.

968
01:25:13.375 --> 01:25:16.458
Thank you for all your help.

969
01:25:19.541 --> 01:25:20.875
Peace be upon you.

970
01:25:38.958 --> 01:25:40.041
Arlo!

971
01:25:40.958 --> 01:25:42.041
Sit down.

972
01:25:46.333 --> 01:25:48.750
Are you happy now?

973
01:25:50.333 --> 01:25:53.541
Please show me one, just one thing,

974
01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:57.625
that she did wrong.

975
01:25:57.708 --> 01:25:58.750
Can you?

976
01:26:00.041 --> 01:26:01.083
Arlo.

977
01:26:02.541 --> 01:26:07.750
Not only is she the daughter of a harlot.

978
01:26:09.791 --> 01:26:12.333
Her mother is also a murderer.

979
01:26:15.416 --> 01:26:18.583
No matter how dark someone's past is,

980
01:26:22.208 --> 01:26:24.791
they're still precious before God.

981
01:26:29.583 --> 01:26:32.041
I'll still marry her.

982
01:26:35.958 --> 01:26:37.166
Arlo!

983
01:27:09.916 --> 01:27:12.708
Zalina, I really want to marry you.

984
01:27:19.166 --> 01:27:21.625
But you've heard about my past.

985
01:27:23.333 --> 01:27:25.291
We have no future together.

986
01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:28.833
My past is too dark for you to bear.

987
01:27:30.208 --> 01:27:33.041
But you and Arka are my future.

988
01:27:36.083 --> 01:27:38.958
You can be happier with someone else,

989
01:27:39.833 --> 01:27:41.291
not with me.

990
01:27:47.166 --> 01:27:48.500
Zalina.

991
01:27:52.375 --> 01:27:54.166
I really mean it.

992
01:27:55.458 --> 01:27:58.125
I really love you

993
01:27:59.791 --> 01:28:01.833
and even your past.

994
01:28:08.541 --> 01:28:11.083
Please listen to your mother

995
01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.708
for heaven lies beneath her feet.

996
01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:19.708
Please love her and respect her decision.

997
01:28:23.875 --> 01:28:25.708
Please leave now.

998
01:28:28.541 --> 01:28:30.333
Your mother must be worried.

999
01:30:17.166 --> 01:30:19.791
RUMAH TEDUH ORPHANAGE

1000
01:31:46.041 --> 01:31:46.958
Arlo.

1001
01:31:52.333 --> 01:31:53.750
All this time,

1002
01:31:55.333 --> 01:31:59.208
I've had a thousand reasons to love you

1003
01:32:02.916 --> 01:32:06.708
and to wait for you.

1004
01:32:13.041 --> 01:32:14.375
Turns out,

1005
01:32:16.291 --> 01:32:20.916
it only takes one reason
for you to leave me.

1006
01:32:26.125 --> 01:32:29.208
Your heart truly doesn't belong to me.

1007
01:32:36.791 --> 01:32:38.000
But…

1008
01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:42.416
But I'm glad.

1009
01:32:45.541 --> 01:32:48.583
Finally you get to follow your heart.

1010
01:32:52.583 --> 01:32:54.333
Arum, I want to apologize.

1011
01:32:55.916 --> 01:32:59.000
I'm sorry for hurting your feelings.

1012
01:33:01.333 --> 01:33:04.625
You may hate me or even punish me.

1013
01:33:04.708 --> 01:33:07.375
But I can't hate you!

1014
01:33:09.625 --> 01:33:11.666
Let alone punish you.

1015
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:20.458
Well.

1016
01:33:23.625 --> 01:33:27.750
If Zalina and her son

1017
01:33:30.583 --> 01:33:33.916
can bring you happiness,

1018
01:33:37.125 --> 01:33:41.375
and if you can make them happy,

1019
01:33:47.666 --> 01:33:51.541
then your relationship
is worth fighting for.

1020
01:33:54.791 --> 01:33:57.583
I'll always pray for you.

1021
01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:09.916
All I can say is

1022
01:34:13.166 --> 01:34:15.333
thank you for everything.

1023
01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:24.666
I'll leave now.

1024
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:29.666
Arum.

1025
01:34:35.458 --> 01:34:38.666
I don't want to lose our friendship.

1026
01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:50.125
I'm so sorry.

1027
01:34:55.666 --> 01:34:57.000
Please forgive me.

1028
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.458
I only ask one thing from you.

1029
01:35:06.833 --> 01:35:10.666
You must follow your dreams.

1030
01:35:12.583 --> 01:35:14.791
Build your own company.

1031
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.500
The company that you want.

1032
01:35:22.833 --> 01:35:23.958
Okay?

1033
01:35:25.125 --> 01:35:26.333
Promise?

1034
01:35:27.125 --> 01:35:28.125
Promise.

1035
01:35:30.083 --> 01:35:31.291
Thanks, Arum.

1036
01:36:15.041 --> 01:36:16.125
Miss Tiwi.

1037
01:36:17.833 --> 01:36:18.958
Mrs. Samira.

1038
01:36:20.250 --> 01:36:22.541
Zalina is out.

1039
01:36:23.208 --> 01:36:24.958
I'm not looking for her.

1040
01:36:25.708 --> 01:36:27.875
I want to talk to you.

1041
01:36:31.166 --> 01:36:36.041
As a regular donor for this orphanage,
I'm disappointed in you.

1042
01:36:36.833 --> 01:36:39.916
Why didn't you tell me who she really was?

1043
01:36:41.583 --> 01:36:43.041
You never asked.

1044
01:36:44.958 --> 01:36:47.708
You've been trusting her for three years.

1045
01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:51.458
Why didn't you ask about her past?

1046
01:36:52.375 --> 01:36:55.750
It means that whoever she is,

1047
01:36:55.833 --> 01:36:58.541
no matter what her past is,

1048
01:37:00.166 --> 01:37:03.583
Zalina is a good person
and you respect her for it.

1049
01:37:05.333 --> 01:37:08.375
I respect her as my employee.

1050
01:37:09.291 --> 01:37:13.666
But to approach my son
and to hope to be in my family,

1051
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:15.000
that's not going to happen.

1052
01:37:16.458 --> 01:37:17.583
How is it fair?

1053
01:37:20.958 --> 01:37:24.250
She can't choose how she was born.

1054
01:37:25.541 --> 01:37:26.458
Besides,

1055
01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:31.500
Laras, Zalina's mother, is just like you.

1056
01:37:32.625 --> 01:37:36.625
You both fight and do anything
for your children.

1057
01:37:40.875 --> 01:37:44.041
Every mother wants the best
for her children.

1058
01:37:44.958 --> 01:37:46.291
Clearly.

1059
01:37:46.375 --> 01:37:49.250
I want the best for my son

1060
01:37:49.333 --> 01:37:51.333
and for him to find the right partner.

1061
01:37:52.458 --> 01:37:55.750
-Love is never wrong.
-Says who?

1062
01:37:55.833 --> 01:37:57.708
Love can be wrong sometimes.

1063
01:37:58.541 --> 01:38:01.250
Just look at me and my husband.

1064
01:38:02.958 --> 01:38:06.125
Love is capable of betraying us.

1065
01:38:08.666 --> 01:38:11.333
Ma'am, pardon my rudeness.

1066
01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:15.833
I think you can't
make peace with your past.

1067
01:38:16.916 --> 01:38:21.458
That's why you can't make peace
with Zalina's past.

1068
01:38:25.041 --> 01:38:26.833
We all have pasts.

1069
01:38:29.333 --> 01:38:31.458
But the future is the most important.

1070
01:38:32.208 --> 01:38:33.750
But when it comes to partners,

1071
01:38:34.416 --> 01:38:38.041
every parent will consider every aspect.

1072
01:38:41.916 --> 01:38:45.916
Arlo's soulmate has been destined by God.

1073
01:38:47.416 --> 01:38:50.166
If Zalina is truly his soulmate,

1074
01:38:51.375 --> 01:38:54.291
we as parents can only pray

1075
01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:57.416
that God paves the way for them

1076
01:38:58.083 --> 01:39:01.625
and for you to open up your heart.

1077
01:39:06.625 --> 01:39:10.500
We pray because of God's will,

1078
01:39:10.583 --> 01:39:12.041
not because of ours.

1079
01:39:16.416 --> 01:39:17.791
Please let it be.

1080
01:39:19.291 --> 01:39:20.416
Accept it.

1081
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:23.541
In the end,

1082
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:26.708
we all deserve happiness.

1083
01:39:42.166 --> 01:39:45.291
I didn't want to talk about this.

1084
01:39:50.125 --> 01:39:52.041
No matter how bad your father is,

1085
01:39:53.291 --> 01:39:55.083
he's still your father.

1086
01:40:00.250 --> 01:40:02.583
It's hard for me to tell you this.

1087
01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:08.625
You were so close to him,

1088
01:40:09.791 --> 01:40:12.208
to the point of idolizing him.

1089
01:40:24.833 --> 01:40:26.875
I was too busy working

1090
01:40:28.166 --> 01:40:30.041
and taking care of business.

1091
01:40:32.291 --> 01:40:35.708
So that he had more time alone

1092
01:40:38.083 --> 01:40:40.625
and cheated on me.

1093
01:40:50.083 --> 01:40:52.416
He went and left you.

1094
01:40:54.916 --> 01:40:56.666
He left me.

1095
01:41:02.833 --> 01:41:05.250
The worst feeling in the world

1096
01:41:06.083 --> 01:41:08.333
is when we put effort

1097
01:41:09.083 --> 01:41:12.583
to be the best for our partner

1098
01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:16.458
only to be betrayed.

1099
01:41:26.958 --> 01:41:29.583
So it wasn't you who left dad.

1100
01:41:30.916 --> 01:41:32.791
It was him.

1101
01:41:42.291 --> 01:41:43.791
I'm so sorry.

1102
01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:48.375
I've never done Tabayyun with you.

1103
01:41:51.041 --> 01:41:52.916
I'm sorry too, Sweetheart.

1104
01:41:57.458 --> 01:42:00.083
I want you to be happy.

1105
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:06.291
I pray that you find a wife

1106
01:42:06.958 --> 01:42:09.375
who brings you happiness.

1107
01:42:10.916 --> 01:42:14.166
I don't want anyone to hurt you.

1108
01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.958
Zalina will never hurt me.

1109
01:42:23.375 --> 01:42:27.583
All her life, she's the one getting hurt.

1110
01:42:30.666 --> 01:42:34.625
That's why she'll never hurt anybody.

1111
01:42:37.375 --> 01:42:38.875
Mom, I'm begging you.

1112
01:42:41.541 --> 01:42:44.083
Please give us your blessing.

1113
01:42:51.583 --> 01:42:55.583
If it's really your choice,
then I'll give you my blessing.

1114
01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:20.125
Let me fix it.

1115
01:43:20.208 --> 01:43:21.458
Okay.

1116
01:43:33.083 --> 01:43:34.333
Peace be upon you.

1117
01:43:38.666 --> 01:43:40.333
Peace be upon you.

1118
01:43:40.416 --> 01:43:43.875
Miss Tiwi, is Zalina here?

1119
01:43:45.083 --> 01:43:46.833
We'd like to propose to her.

1120
01:43:52.375 --> 01:43:54.791
Zalina just left for the airport.

1121
01:43:54.875 --> 01:43:57.041
She got a job in Bali.

1122
01:44:02.666 --> 01:44:04.000
Excuse me.

1123
01:44:04.083 --> 01:44:04.916
Okay.

1124
01:44:11.791 --> 01:44:12.958
Thank God.

1125
01:44:14.541 --> 01:44:15.875
Hello?

1126
01:44:15.958 --> 01:44:19.708
Please get a plane ticket for Arlo,
from Kertajati to Ngurah Rai.

1127
01:44:19.791 --> 01:44:21.916
Do it now.

1128
01:44:23.708 --> 01:44:26.791
-Did you get it?
-I'm working on it.

1129
01:44:28.791 --> 01:44:31.250
-Please drive faster.
-Yes, Sir.

1130
01:44:36.125 --> 01:44:38.916
Zalina Anindita, destination Bali.

1131
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.666
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1132
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:41.958
Let's go!

1133
01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:43.708
Please.

1134
01:44:43.791 --> 01:44:45.291
May I see your ticket?

1135
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:52.458
Zalina's phone is not active.

1136
01:45:08.583 --> 01:45:12.208
Good afternoon. Destination Bali.
May I see your ticket?

1137
01:45:13.833 --> 01:45:16.666
-Here's your boarding pass.
-Thank you.

1138
01:45:18.916 --> 01:45:21.458
Mom, pray for me.

1139
01:45:23.041 --> 01:45:26.083
I'll always pray for the best
for both of you.

1140
01:45:28.125 --> 01:45:29.708
Please take care.

1141
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:38.958
Thank you.

1142
01:45:42.916 --> 01:45:44.208
Zalina!

1143
01:45:46.791 --> 01:45:48.208
Uncle Arlo!

1144
01:45:53.541 --> 01:45:55.291
Hello, Arka.

1145
01:45:56.166 --> 01:45:59.916
-I miss you, Uncle.
-Me too.

1146
01:46:09.791 --> 01:46:10.791
Hi.

1147
01:46:13.916 --> 01:46:17.416
You're here…

1148
01:46:21.250 --> 01:46:23.500
Mom has given us her blessing.

1149
01:46:27.916 --> 01:46:29.375
Zalina Anindita…

1150
01:46:30.875 --> 01:46:33.750
By the mandate that God has given us,

1151
01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:38.000
I want to be your Imam

1152
01:46:39.708 --> 01:46:41.666
to guide our future family.

1153
01:46:45.625 --> 01:46:46.500
Me,

1154
01:46:47.208 --> 01:46:48.250
you,

1155
01:46:49.208 --> 01:46:50.375
Arka.

1156
01:46:53.458 --> 01:46:55.375
We'll go where God leads us

1157
01:46:56.666 --> 01:46:59.208
and to the gates of heaven together.

1158
01:47:14.041 --> 01:47:15.750
Will you be my wife?

1159
01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:29.875
Arlo.

1160
01:47:31.791 --> 01:47:34.500
After everything I've been through,

1161
01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:39.708
I need more time.

1162
01:47:45.083 --> 01:47:46.916
What are you waiting for?

1163
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:50.000
I've fought for my mom's blessing.

1164
01:47:52.166 --> 01:47:56.375
I vow to make you and Arka happy.

1165
01:48:02.958 --> 01:48:04.916
Please, Mom!

1166
01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:28.625
In the name of God…

1167
01:48:30.791 --> 01:48:32.041
Arlo.

1168
01:48:35.666 --> 01:48:38.375
I will marry you.

1169
01:48:40.166 --> 01:48:42.041
Thank God!

1170
01:49:00.375 --> 01:49:03.250
Arka, from today,

1171
01:49:03.333 --> 01:49:05.791
you can call me Dad.

1172
01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:11.500
I have a dad! Hooray!
