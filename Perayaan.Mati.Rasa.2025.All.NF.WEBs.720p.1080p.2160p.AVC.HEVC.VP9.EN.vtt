00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.791
<i>numbing my feelings.</i>

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:56.082

I created in my own head.</i>

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:03.749

10
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.124

One, two. One, two, three, four!

00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:34.915
Let's go! Run, faster!

15
00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:36.374
We're late!

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:40.707
Hey! Wait!

18
00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:41.707
Please, don't do it.

19
00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:43.625
Sorry. But the audition has been closed.

20
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.124
Shit!

21
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:50.290
- We're too late!
- Calm down.

22
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:51.458
Ouch!

Hello.

You may enter, we're just reporters.

26
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:05.540
- Do you want to say something?
- No.

27
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:06.957
<i>- Who is that?
- My brother.</i>

Somebody help him!

35
00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:34.207
Hey, help him!

36
00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:37.874
- Move!
- Help him!

37
00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:40.499
We still have two performances after this.

38
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.790
And also the mystery guest
who's no longer a mystery right now.

39
00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:44.874
Here's the mystery guest!

40
00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:47.875
The Adams!

41
00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:55.625
Oh, dear.

42
00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:00.332
Where is Ian?

43
00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:02.249
He doesn't answer my calls.

44
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.832
He doesn't reply to my text.

45
00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:05.790
And it's raining.

46
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:07.540
THE BEST NEW PODCASTER

47
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:08.750
Cool, huh?

48
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.000
Awesome.

49
00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:15.208
- Perfect spot too.
- Of course.

50
00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:17.208
Cool.

51
00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:19.166
What's wrong with Mom?

52
00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:21.582
I don't know.

53
00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:23.250
What if we run away?

54
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.458
No.

55
00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:36.290
Where's Ian anyway?

56
00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:39.249
You know I'm just
a kid from the neighborhood.

57
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.625
And you are his brother.

58
00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:45.624
What? You're his closest friend.
He doesn't even consider me his brother.

59
00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.957
Maybe they postponed the show due to rain.

60
00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.915
They shouldn't postpone it.
They should just cancel the show.

61
00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:55.416
- Well...
- That's unbelievable. I'm tired...

62
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.624
Now, shush.

63
00:04:57.625 --> 00:05:00.832
- Shush, and hold your husband.
- He knew it was his brother's birthday.

64
00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:03.457
Come here, come into my arms.
You know I am rarely home.

65
00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:05.874
- Okay?
- I'm so mad. It's typically him.

66
00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:09.582
Just stop being mad. You don't
want to spike your blood pressure.

67
00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:11.458
I can take medication for that.

68
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:13.707
So annoying!

69
00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:15.875
Stop pouting.

70
00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:19.666
Hey.

71
00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:21.999
Next month...

72
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.124
would there be an upcoming event?

73
00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:24.874
Stop joking with me.

74
00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:27.915
Don't forget, our next anniversary...

75
00:05:27.916 --> 00:05:30.791
will be the silver anniversary. 25 years.

76
00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:33.583
What are you going to give me for a gift?

77
00:05:37.583 --> 00:05:39.083
What do you have in mind?

78
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.750
I...

79
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:45.249
I want...

80
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.291
I want to poop!

81
00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:50.582
He fell...

82
00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.125
What are you watching?

83
00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:55.832
- Delete it.
- Hey, don't delete it, Ian!

84
00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:57.957
There's always
something wrong with this band.

85
00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.165
We are doomed never to do any gigs.

86
00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.499
Yeah, who told you
to do a stage dive? Moron.

87
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.249
How about we play the song I wrote?

88
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.624
The song from your demo,

89
00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:10.332
where the lyrics are a tutorial
to make a boiled nugget.

90
00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:13.332
What if we try again
with a Resonate audition?

91
00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:15.582
We might score a major label?

92
00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.332
Not another major label.
Have you forgotten already?

93
00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:20.082
They made us write pop songs.

94
00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:21.582
Like Nidji songs.

95
00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:22.499
Never.

96
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.790
My brother is going to university.
How do I pay for his tuition?

97
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:27.665
Get a real job, moron.
What do you expect from being in a band?

98
00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:30.832
My girlfriend has started asking too.
If I don't propose to her this year

99
00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:32.665
her father is going to
set her up with another man.

100
00:06:32.666 --> 00:06:33.707
With who?

101
00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:37.249
Some dude whose father is in the
police department or military.

102
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.208
You know, financially secure.

103
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.124
- Good for her.
- Yeah.

104
00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:48.041
- Good for her.
- He's more wealthy.

105
00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:49.916
Lame.

106
00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:53.458
Not to mention my father.

107
00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.207
If the band is going nowhere...

108
00:06:56.208 --> 00:07:00.124
he's gonna make me run
my grandfather's cow farm.

109
00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:03.750
Fuck, I hate thinking
about handling cow dung.

110
00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.083
What about you, Ian?

111
00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.208
- What about you, Ian?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:15.500
- What?
- Cow dung, right?

113
00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:17.499
It's monkey dung!

114
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.958
What does it look like?

115
00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:24.249
"Why don't you try this app...

116
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.250
it will change your voice."

117
00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:34.165
Yes, Dad?

118
00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:35.790
- May I come in?
- Of course.

119
00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:38.749
How's your final thesis?

120
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.957
Well, I need time to finish it.

121
00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.749
Sure, but in order to finish it
you need to start somewhere.

122
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.041
Fine, I'll get it done.

123
00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:50.708
Can I ask you something?

124
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.374
Do you know what kind of special gift...

125
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:57.166
that women like?

126
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.790
Let me think.

127
00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:00.624
A purse, stuff?

128
00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:03.124
A song? Maybe...

129
00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:04.583
A painting?

130
00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:06.458
What?

131
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:08.374
Nothing...

132
00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:09.707
What, Dad?

133
00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:11.707
- You're acting weird.
- That's it.

134
00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:12.916
That's so funny.

135
00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:18.041
Cute boy!

136
00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:23.415
Ta.

137
00:08:23.416 --> 00:08:25.500
I know I was a cute boy.

138
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.333
Come here.

139
00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:36.499
I remember when you were little,
both of you were inseparable.

140
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.708
Even your toys had to be the same.

141
00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:45.208
But now everything's changed.

142
00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:48.166
Right?

143
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.250
Yeah, I feel the same way too.

144
00:08:51.083 --> 00:08:53.749
He pushes me away too.

145
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.041
Is it maybe because when Ian was
a boy, I wasn't always there for him?

146
00:08:58.791 --> 00:09:01.083
No, I don't think so, Dad.

147
00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:10.540
- I'm gonna leave you making content.
- Go to bed, Dad.

148
00:09:10.541 --> 00:09:12.332
Remember to drink plenty of water.

149
00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:13.958
Okay.

150
00:09:15.041 --> 00:09:17.291
- Thanks, Ta.
- No problem.

151

CHECK THIS RECENT POST, HURRY!

154

I'M SENDING YOU THE VIDEO!

155
00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:48.790
Peace be upon you too.

156
00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:52.540
You forgot the greeting
when you enter a house?

157
00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:54.999
Peace be upon you.

158
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.665
You said the concert began at 4 p.m.
and ended at 5 p.m.

159
00:09:57.666 --> 00:09:59.415
You said you'd be home at 8 p.m.

But now you're home at 10 p.m.

Why won't you communicate with us?

162
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.332
Talk to us.

163
00:10:07.333 --> 00:10:09.166
Pick up your phone.

164
00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:12.165
We were all waiting for you.

165
00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:15.833
Your brother had to
change his vlogging schedule.

166
00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:18.624
Your brother is just as busy...

167
00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:22.374
but he still makes time for his family.

168
00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:25.207
I was about to come home.

169
00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.165
But the crowd wanted more.

170
00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:31.166
I can't believe how crazy my fans are
when they listen to my songs.

171
00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:34.541
Really?

172
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.040
- Pick him up!
- Ouch!

173
00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:42.291
Okay, I'll be in my room, Mom.

174
00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:44.791
Hey, Ian.

175
00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:46.875
What's wrong with your back?

176
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:49.333
You know, Mom...

177
00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.499
I'm a rock star!

178
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.916
I've been thinking, Din.

179
00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:56.249
I wonder why our band is going nowhere.

180
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.166
What?

181
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.124
Are you delirious?

182
00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:00.125
Ouch!

183
00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:04.290
The Ian that I know
loves playing music, like Dad.

184
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:07.750
Then he got so excited when Uta
clapped his hands. Yay! Like that.

185
00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:09.750
What changed you?

186
00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:14.583
Are you competing with somebody?

187
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.416
Like with your brother maybe? Be honest.

188
00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:24.958
Do you like the songs you wrote?

189
00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:29.124
- I do, some of them.
- You do?

190
00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:31.332
There you go. Make another song.

191
00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:36.666
Make a song that comes from your heart.

192
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:40.249
- Why are you laughing at me?
- Smarty-pants!

193
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.082
- Are you mocking me?
- Go home!

194
00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:43.832
- See you.
- Okay, say hi to your dad.

195
00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:45.999
Tell him his daughter loves talking
so much, she'd pass as a motivator.

196
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.957
- Does that mean you're motivated?
- Not at all!

197
00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.125
Okay.

198
00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:57.875
UTA ANTONO - THE BEST NEW PODCASTER

199
00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:12.165
OCEAN - SEE YOU - EMPTY

200
00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:15.250
OCEAN

201
00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:43.832
Yes!

202
00:12:43.833 --> 00:12:45.374
<i>Spontan, uhuy!</i>

203
00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:49.124
<i>Weh, weh, weh.</i>

204
00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:50.790
<i>Komeng!</i>

205
00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:52.582
<i>What are you saying?</i>

206
00:12:52.583 --> 00:12:54.375
<i>Oh, my.</i>

207
00:12:55.791 --> 00:12:58.165
<i>We'll meet again.</i>

208
00:12:58.166 --> 00:12:59.749
How many times do I have to tell you?

209
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.250
When you're recording, close the door!

210
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.582
Cool, right? So, for my podcast...

211
00:13:07.583 --> 00:13:11.415
I'll read quotes
with famous people's voices.

212
00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:12.665
What?

213
00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:15.915
Don't forget to pick up Mom's medicine.
I have to leave.

214
00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:17.624
Okay, uhuy!

215
00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:18.832
Stop being so mad all the time.

216
00:13:18.833 --> 00:13:20.790
- Where are you going, Son?
- An audition, Dad. I'm in a hurry.

217
00:13:20.791 --> 00:13:22.207
Hang on, Son. Come here.

218
00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:23.541
Oh boy...

219
00:13:25.041 --> 00:13:26.582
- Can I borrow that?
- Sure.

220
00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:28.540
This will just take a minute.

221
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.957
This is...

222
00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.415
- Okay.
- Click this.

223
00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:32.707
This one, Dad.

224
00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:34.791
Okay, sit right here. Sit down.

225
00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:37.708
Now listen.

226
00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:45.249
So, I wrote this song...

227
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.624
a long ago for your mother.

228
00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:49.249
But I don't know why,

229
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.916
I still can't finish the song.

230
00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:53.790
I want to ask you a favor...

231
00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:55.874
to help me finish the song...

232
00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:59.165
for a wedding anniversary gift
to your mother.

233
00:13:59.166 --> 00:14:03.457
On our anniversary, I want to take her...

234
00:14:03.458 --> 00:14:05.707
aboard my first ship.

235
00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:07.499
I'll play the music

236
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.707
and I'll ask her to dance.

237
00:14:09.708 --> 00:14:11.208
Wouldn't that be romantic?

238
00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:14.250
But are you interested, Ian?

239
00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:17.333
Hang on.

240
00:14:18.375 --> 00:14:19.666
Sorry, Dad. Hang on.

241
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.291
Hey, Dik.

242
00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.166
Yeah, I'm on my way.

243
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.250
Dad.

244
00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.540
I'm so sorry.

245
00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:34.624
I have to leave.
I'll listen to the song when I get back.

246
00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:36.540
Okay.

247
00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:38.291
- Later, Dad.
- Good luck!

248
00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:42.624
Hey, but yesterday he said...

249
00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:44.166
the show was a success, right?

250
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.958
The show?

251
00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.040
Are you okay, Ian?

252
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:05.874
- Acid reflux.
- Acid reflux?

253
00:15:05.875 --> 00:15:07.374
I haven't eaten.

254
00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:08.291
Try this.

255
00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:10.416
My girlfriend made this.

256
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.665
Hey, don't eat the whole thing.

257
00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.874
I have the blessed water from my grandma.

258
00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:20.832
She blessed the water
so our audition goes well.

259
00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:22.249
- Give it to me.
- You have to drink it.

260
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.250
- What's in it?
- Just drink it!

261
00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.374
- It stinks!
- It does?

262
00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:32.624
How come?

263
00:15:32.625 --> 00:15:36.082
Because she gargled with the water.

264
00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:38.582
- Fuck! That's gross!
- Fuck! Son of a bitch!

265
00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:40.249
Midnight Serenade!

266
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.957
Yes.

267
00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.582
You're next. Stand by, okay?

268
00:15:43.583 --> 00:15:44.916
Thanks!

269
00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:47.416
Guys...

270
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.999
how about we play <i>Ocean</i>?

271
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.624
- Come on, Ian...
- Please,

272
00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:53.040
many people can relate to the story
about missing their father.

273
00:15:53.041 --> 00:15:54.207
Please?

274
00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:56.249
- It doesn't fit with the crowd, Ian.
- Why not?

275
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.415
This is our phase one audition.

276
00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.040
Don't forget. We have to impress them.

277
00:16:00.041 --> 00:16:03.582
We have to make sure the judges
are impressed by our performance.

278
00:16:03.583 --> 00:16:04.915
We can't play <i>Ocean</i>, Ian.

279
00:16:04.916 --> 00:16:06.749
Why do you want to
play that song all of a sudden?

280
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.583
No reason. I just feel like playing it.

281
00:16:09.166 --> 00:16:10.707
Or maybe...

282
00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:12.749
the water from my grandma inspired him!

283
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.040
Please, let's play the song.

284
00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:15.624
Can I play <i>Boiled Nugget Bread</i> too?

285
00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:17.665
- Sure, you and his grandma.
- Fine.

286
00:16:17.666 --> 00:16:19.790
We'll play the song, but if they hate it...

287
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:21.166
I blame it all on you, okay?

288
00:16:21.833 --> 00:16:23.374
My grandma will take all the blame.

289
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:25.374
Hey, man! Great performance!

290
00:16:25.375 --> 00:16:27.041
God bless you.

291
00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:30.332
Hey, man. This Chinese wine is perfect.

292
00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:32.499
Whoa, thanks, dude.

293
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.124
Next band, let's welcome...

294
00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:39.458
Midnight Serenade!

295
00:18:39.875 --> 00:18:43.332
Dik, the white shirt, Leon.

296
00:18:43.333 --> 00:18:44.790
Leon who?

297
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:47.207
Major label, Dailywaves Records.

298
00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:49.415
Next, we're gonna play a special song...

299
00:18:49.416 --> 00:18:50.624
The title is...

300
00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:52.165
Just do stage diving!

301
00:18:52.166 --> 00:18:53.540
You don't need to sing!

302
00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:55.416
You're not that famous!

303
00:18:59.708 --> 00:19:02.125
Hey, relax!

304
00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:09.874
- Security!
- Everybody, stop!

305
00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:12.166
Calm down, people!

306
00:19:15.166 --> 00:19:17.040
<i>- Everyone, calm down.</i>
- Hey, calm down!

307
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:19.749
<i>- Everyone, please calm down.</i>
- Cool it, come with me.

308
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.166
What are you doing?

309
00:19:21.916 --> 00:19:23.458
Stop it!

310
00:19:25.916 --> 00:19:27.207
Ian.

311
00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.833
What's wrong with you?

312
00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:33.249
When you're in a situation like that,
you have to keep it cool.

313
00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.375
Keep your temper.

314
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:41.458
You can't control their behaviour,
but you can control yours.

315
00:19:44.875 --> 00:19:47.332
I want you to be
successful in your career.

316
00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:51.125
I'll support you 100 percent.
I will support you.

317
00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:55.708
But if you fight again like that,
I have to reprimand you!

318
00:19:59.291 --> 00:20:01.290
There are drunk men
coming to this kind of show.

319
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:02.749
What if someone stabbed you with a knife?

320
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.999
Set a good example for everybody.

321
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.332
I've never taught
you to be short tempered.

322
00:20:07.333 --> 00:20:09.083
And where have you been all this time?

323
00:20:14.208 --> 00:20:16.207
How dare you try to control me.

324
00:20:16.208 --> 00:20:18.166
Controlling you how?

325
00:20:20.333 --> 00:20:22.041
What are you doing here anyway, Dad?

326
00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.790
- Well, I...
- I didn't ask you to come.

327
00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:27.832
And when you finally come...

328
00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:31.249
all you want from me
is to become a perfect son.

329
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.458
You expect me to be
a good example for Uta.

330
00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:37.000
But you forgot...

331
00:20:38.208 --> 00:20:41.375
you've never showed me how, Dad.

332
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.750
Are you day dreaming?

333
00:20:57.083 --> 00:20:58.125
Ian.

334
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:24.708
<i>Ian...</i>

335
00:21:25.375 --> 00:21:26.540
<i>where are you?</i>

336
00:21:26.541 --> 00:21:27.457
IAN - WHERE ARE YOU?

337
00:21:27.458 --> 00:21:28.999
<i>Mom's been asking.</i>

338
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.374
WHAT TIME WILL YOU COME HOME?

339
00:21:30.375 --> 00:21:32.249
He contacted me earlier.

340
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.999
Yeah, he said he's
stopping by his friend's house.

341
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.375
He'll be home soon.

342
00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:38.791
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

343
00:21:40.125 --> 00:21:43.041
<i>if you think I've never been there for you.</i>

344
00:21:44.666 --> 00:21:47.332
<i>I know, you're mad at me.</i>

345
00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:50.082
<i>Maybe that's the price I have to pay...</i>

346
00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:52.082
<i>in order to give you a better life.</i>

347
00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:53.791
<i>For all of you.</i>

348
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:57.958
<i>Again, I'm sorry.</i>

349
00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:01.875
<i>I really am.</i>

350
00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:05.583
<i>Let's continue our conversation tomorrow...</i>

351
00:22:06.416 --> 00:22:08.125
<i>before I leave for my next voyage.</i>

352
00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:16.499
<i>Right now there is a big typhoon
hitting the Sea of Japan...</i>

353
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.249
<i>which is impacting the northern
and eastern part of our surrounding sea.</i>

354
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.707
<i>Its also impacting the Jakarta area.</i>

355
00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:26.332
<i>The low air pressure from the typhoon
is changing the wind course and rainfall...</i>

356
00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:27.665
<i>- in several areas.</i>
- Where have you been?

357
00:22:27.666 --> 00:22:28.708
<i>Including Jakarta.</i>

358
00:22:31.708 --> 00:22:32.916
Is he okay?

359
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.415
Don't forget to take your meds, okay?

360
00:22:37.416 --> 00:22:38.790
Okay.

361
00:22:38.791 --> 00:22:40.540
Uta, make sure your mom takes her meds.

362
00:22:40.541 --> 00:22:41.625
Yes, Sir.

363
00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:43.416
Okay.

364
00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:46.458
Wear this scarf, okay?

365
00:22:48.666 --> 00:22:49.500
Ahem.

366
00:22:53.416 --> 00:22:55.040
I think I recognize the scent.

367
00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:57.250
I sprayed it a little with my perfume...

368
00:22:58.041 --> 00:22:59.457
so you won't forget me.

369
00:22:59.458 --> 00:23:01.500
What if it makes me miss you more?

370
00:23:02.083 --> 00:23:04.374
- You'd better.
- Really?

371
00:23:04.375 --> 00:23:06.125
Don't tell me you won't miss me.

372
00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:12.291
Don't get tired of waiting for me.

373
00:23:12.875 --> 00:23:14.625
That will never happen.

374
00:23:23.708 --> 00:23:26.207
Stop smiling.

375
00:23:26.208 --> 00:23:27.665
Thesis.

376
00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:29.708
Don't forget.

377
00:23:30.875 --> 00:23:32.207
You may have a good career...

378
00:23:32.208 --> 00:23:34.125
but you must never neglect your education.

379
00:23:34.708 --> 00:23:36.332
- Yes, Sir.
- Please.

380
00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:37.750
Bye, Dad. Take care.

381
00:24:04.125 --> 00:24:06.708
Bye, Ian. It's time for me to go.

382
00:24:08.333 --> 00:24:10.375
Take care of Mom
and your brother for me, will you?

383
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.582
Okay?

384
00:24:13.583 --> 00:24:15.082
ESC - EASTERN SHIPPING COMPANY

385
00:24:15.083 --> 00:24:17.291
Don't forget to call us!

386
00:24:27.208 --> 00:24:28.375
Bye!

387
00:24:29.083 --> 00:24:30.458
Take care, Dad!

388
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.290
I'm sorry, Mom.

389
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:35.125
It was too late for me to come home
from Ray's house last night.

390
00:24:36.125 --> 00:24:37.750
It's typically you.

391
00:24:41.375 --> 00:24:42.541
Bro, about this.

392
00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:45.499
It's Dad's song, let's finish it together.

393
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.707
Stop pretending to be kind to me.

394
00:24:46.708 --> 00:24:47.875
What are you talking about?

395
00:24:49.291 --> 00:24:50.291
I know it was you...

396
00:24:50.791 --> 00:24:53.208
who told Dad where I performed.

397
00:24:54.291 --> 00:24:55.500
You're a snitch.

398
00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:06.791
As we grow older, I realized...

399
00:25:07.333 --> 00:25:10.125
we have to get used to changes.

400
00:25:11.291 --> 00:25:14.040
<i>For example, you had someone
who you looked up to...</i>

401
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:15.957
<i>you idolized them,</i>

402
00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:18.165
<i>and then they're drifting away...</i>

403
00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:20.957
<i>avoiding you for no clear reason</i>

404
00:25:20.958 --> 00:25:24.291
<i>so that it makes you wonder.</i>

405
00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:28.290
Well, c'est la vie.

406
00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:31.999
There are so many questions you need
to figure out the answer yourself.

407
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.665
Because in the end the only one
you can rely on is yourself.

408
00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:36.332
Not other people.

409
00:25:36.333 --> 00:25:37.832
And you have to be ready,

410
00:25:37.833 --> 00:25:40.249
whenever that time comes.

411
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.458
Ray?

412
00:25:49.583 --> 00:25:50.750
Sat?

413
00:25:52.125 --> 00:25:52.957
Dik?

414
00:25:52.958 --> 00:25:58.415
- We passed the second phase!
- Yay! We passed the second phase!

415
00:25:58.416 --> 00:26:00.999
- We'll be booked in many gigs after this.
- We passed?

416
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.207
- Ian Antono is going to be a rock star!
- Yeah.

417
00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:05.291
So the judges loved our songs?

418
00:26:08.125 --> 00:26:09.000
The thing is...

419
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.540
we actually came in 4th place.

420
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:13.290
We didn't make it to the Big Three.

421
00:26:13.291 --> 00:26:15.165
Band Ngeles...

422
00:26:15.166 --> 00:26:16.790
was disqualified.

423
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:19.291
- For what?
- They found out...

424
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.207
Hey, we have a week
to rehearse for the audition.

425
00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:26.915
We already know what
we're going to do next, right?

426
00:26:26.916 --> 00:26:28.624
Get drunk!

427
00:26:28.625 --> 00:26:30.541
- Dik.
- Rehearse.

428
00:26:31.333 --> 00:26:32.374
No, sorry.

429
00:26:32.375 --> 00:26:34.207
We have to rehearse 24/7, okay?

430
00:26:34.208 --> 00:26:35.624
Okay?

431
00:26:35.625 --> 00:26:37.208
Group hug!

432
00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:41.916
Yay!

433
00:26:44.208 --> 00:26:46.749
Wow!

434
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:50.374
Shit. Too heavy.

435
00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:51.833
Too heavy.

436
00:26:58.375 --> 00:27:00.165
SEVEN DAYS LATER

437
00:27:00.166 --> 00:27:01.375
Hey, Ian.

438
00:27:02.541 --> 00:27:03.708
How are you?

439
00:27:04.625 --> 00:27:06.375
Mom says you've been busy?

440
00:27:07.208 --> 00:27:09.415
I have to run, Dad.
I have to go to the audition.

441
00:27:09.416 --> 00:27:12.040
Okay, good luck!

442
00:27:12.041 --> 00:27:13.541
<i>Sure, Dad.</i>

443
00:27:14.208 --> 00:27:16.249
I have to go too.

444
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.165
I'll hang out with Dinda...

445
00:27:18.166 --> 00:27:19.333
and you know.

446
00:27:19.916 --> 00:27:21.540
- Okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

447
00:27:21.541 --> 00:27:23.457
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>
- Bye.

448
00:27:23.458 --> 00:27:25.750
- Miss you.
- <i>Miss you too, Honey.</i>

449
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.083
I'll see you later, Mom!

450
00:27:36.208 --> 00:27:38.958
- Don't stay out late.
- Okay.

451
00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:44.333
Mom?

452
00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:49.166
Sit down.

453
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.707
- Can you get me my meds?
- Okay.

454
00:27:53.708 --> 00:27:54.875
Hang on.

455
00:27:57.333 --> 00:27:58.541
The meds...

456
00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:06.166
INTERNAL MEDS

457
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:15.500
Are you sure you're going to be okay, Mom?

458
00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:17.583
Yes, I'm fine.

459
00:28:18.416 --> 00:28:20.624
You should go now.
You don't want to be late.

460
00:28:20.625 --> 00:28:21.541
Okay.

461
00:28:22.208 --> 00:28:24.832
- Are you sure?
- Yes, go.

462
00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:27.249
- Promise me you'll call, okay?
- Will do.

463
00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.375
Promise.

464
00:28:32.666 --> 00:28:34.041
Text me if you need anything, okay?

465
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.625
- You too.
- Okay.

466
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:45.874
Dik. Dik, it's full of people.

467
00:28:45.875 --> 00:28:47.874
Can you wait here, please?
The MC will call you to the stage soon.

468
00:28:47.875 --> 00:28:49.915
Okay. Thanks, man.

469
00:28:49.916 --> 00:28:51.375
My goodness.

470
00:28:55.458 --> 00:28:57.124
Are you sure you don't want to play <i>Ocean</i>?

471
00:28:57.125 --> 00:28:58.707
- I'm afraid it's too mellow.
- Really?

472
00:28:58.708 --> 00:29:01.290
Too mellow. Look at them.
Take a look at them.

473
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:04.374
The judges are the Romantic Echoes,
Iga Massardi Barasuara.

474
00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:06.708
You know how powerful their songs are?

475
00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:09.707
Let's play our side stream songs instead.

476
00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:11.165
Okay?

477
00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:13.374
Midnight Serenade!

478
00:29:13.375 --> 00:29:14.457
Can you hold this for me?

479
00:29:14.458 --> 00:29:16.125
Hang on.

480
00:29:17.458 --> 00:29:19.541
DO NOT DISTURB

481
00:29:22.375 --> 00:29:23.333
Miss.

482
00:29:23.916 --> 00:29:25.958
Can you record our performance please?
Thank you.

483
00:30:25.916 --> 00:30:27.415
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

484
00:30:27.416 --> 00:30:28.500
Let me kiss your hand.

485
00:30:42.458 --> 00:30:43.375
Mom!

486
00:30:46.666 --> 00:30:48.082
Mom?

487
00:30:48.083 --> 00:30:49.749
Uta!

488
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.915
Mom? Mom!

489
00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:53.333
Uta!

490
00:30:59.875 --> 00:31:03.083
It seems like you are trying too hard.

491
00:31:03.666 --> 00:31:06.040
And after watching your performance,

492
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:08.707
Jack and I are wishing you...

493
00:31:08.708 --> 00:31:12.583
good luck with your performance on our
Road Tour Resonate Fest next year!

494
00:31:18.333 --> 00:31:21.749
<i>Okay, it has been Midnight Serenade.</i>

495
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.540
<i>So, friends, thank you very much.</i>

496
00:31:24.541 --> 00:31:25.915
Don't blame me.

497
00:31:25.916 --> 00:31:28.040
I sang off-key.

498
00:31:28.041 --> 00:31:30.166
You played the wrong effect.

499
00:31:33.458 --> 00:31:34.582
I played it correctly.

500
00:31:34.583 --> 00:31:36.332
Who triggered me?

501
00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:38.458
Your effect...

502
00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:41.958
You sang off-key!

503
00:31:45.458 --> 00:31:47.707
Hey, Ian?

504
00:31:47.708 --> 00:31:52.750
Sorry.

505
00:31:59.416 --> 00:32:00.458
How's Mom?

506
00:32:01.625 --> 00:32:02.957
The doctor in the ER said...

507
00:32:02.958 --> 00:32:03.915
THIS DOOR MUST BE KEPT CLOSED

508
00:32:03.916 --> 00:32:05.500
...Mom had a heart attack.

509
00:32:06.208 --> 00:32:08.708
This afternoon, Mom looked okay
after taking her meds.

510
00:32:09.708 --> 00:32:12.290
She wasn't feeling well all afternoon?
Why didn't you tell me?

511
00:32:12.291 --> 00:32:14.124
Are you expecting me
to tell you everything?

512
00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:15.249
The doctor was asking me...

513
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.499
- You were there with her all afternoon!
- Ian, Uta!

514
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.541
Stop!

515
00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:21.875
Arguing won't solve anything.

516
00:32:22.958 --> 00:32:24.083
Let's pray.

517
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.957
- Hello.
- <i>Hello, Ta?</i>

518
00:32:31.958 --> 00:32:34.624
- Yes, Dad?
- <i>How's your mom?</i>

519
00:32:34.625 --> 00:32:36.916
This is her second heart attack.

520
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.374
Her risk is greater.

521
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:43.207
<i>I know. So let's keep praying
for her recovery.</i>

522
00:32:43.208 --> 00:32:44.874
<i>Okay? Where's your brother?</i>

523
00:32:44.875 --> 00:32:46.041
Ian...

524
00:32:48.166 --> 00:32:49.458
<i>Hello, Ta?</i>

525
00:32:50.416 --> 00:32:51.374
Uta?

526
00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:54.082
He's not here yet.

527
00:32:54.083 --> 00:32:57.415
<i>Okay, stay with your mom, okay?</i>

528
00:32:57.416 --> 00:32:59.290
<i>- Keep me posted.</i>
- Okay, Dad.

529
00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:01.666
<i>All we can do right now is pray...</i>

530
00:33:05.208 --> 00:33:06.416
It's disconnected.

531
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.290
Excuse me, Sir. Can I help you?

532
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:25.832
I'm Mrs. Dini's family.

533
00:33:25.833 --> 00:33:27.041
Of course, please.

534
00:34:36.958 --> 00:34:38.874
Check her pulse. Give her the injection.

535
00:34:38.875 --> 00:34:41.041
- How many cc?
- Just five.

536
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.375
Get Dr. Prabu.

537
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:45.665
Right now.

538
00:34:45.666 --> 00:34:47.040
How's her condition?

539
00:34:47.041 --> 00:34:48.540
She has complications.

540
00:34:48.541 --> 00:34:50.500
Where's Dr. Prabu?

541
00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:30.374
Hey.

542
00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:31.415
Oh, shit.

543
00:35:31.416 --> 00:35:34.165
- Sorry.
- There's water on the floor.

544
00:35:34.166 --> 00:35:35.833
Excuse me, nurse, do you have a cloth?

545
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.625
Thank you.

546
00:35:41.666 --> 00:35:42.833
Thank you, Din.

547
00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:46.666
You've always been there
for me and my mom.

548
00:35:47.291 --> 00:35:50.624
She's like a mother to me.

549
00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:52.457
If I didn't have her...

550
00:35:52.458 --> 00:35:56.750
I wouldn't know how to let my mother go.

551
00:35:59.083 --> 00:36:01.125
When she gets better...

552
00:36:01.708 --> 00:36:04.333
you should spend more time with her, Ian.

553
00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:09.415
She misses you.

554
00:36:09.416 --> 00:36:11.083
But she's too proud to tell you.

555
00:36:12.208 --> 00:36:14.416
You don't want to regret...

556
00:36:15.291 --> 00:36:17.500
not spending
enough time with her like I did.

557
00:36:28.583 --> 00:36:30.458
<i>Hello, Ian.</i>

558
00:36:31.125 --> 00:36:33.290
<i>Did Dad contact you in any way?</i>

559
00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:35.290
<i>It's been two days
since the last time he called.</i>

560
00:36:35.291 --> 00:36:38.040
<i>He's not answering my calls either.</i>

561
00:36:38.041 --> 00:36:40.749
<i>And since he asked me to keep him posted...</i>

562
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.874
<i>and update him on Mom's condition,</i>

563
00:36:42.875 --> 00:36:44.665
<i>I'm so confused right now.</i>

564
00:36:44.666 --> 00:36:46.207
Okay, I'll call him after this.

565
00:36:46.208 --> 00:36:48.625
<i>- Okay, thanks, Bro.</i>
- Sure.

566
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:58.915
<i>Sorry, the number
you are calling cannot be reached.</i>

567
00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:00.250
<i>Please try again...</i>

568
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:01.916
That's odd.

569
00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:09.415
DAD

570
00:37:09.416 --> 00:37:13.458
TODAY - TEST

571
00:37:23.458 --> 00:37:25.625
FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA
YOU ARE WHAT YOU LISTEN TO

572
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:41.665
DAD - LAST SEEN TWO DAYS AGO

573
00:37:41.666 --> 00:37:43.166
AUDITION SERIES

574
00:38:03.083 --> 00:38:04.416
Excuse me.

575
00:38:06.416 --> 00:38:08.207
Excuse me!

576
00:38:08.208 --> 00:38:09.791
Just a moment!

577
00:38:12.166 --> 00:38:14.416
- Excuse me.
- Yeah!

578
00:38:29.833 --> 00:38:32.832
My name is Banyu, and this is Alam.

579
00:38:32.833 --> 00:38:36.040
We're from Eastern Shipping Company.

580
00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:40.291
Are you Mr. Satya Antono's son?

581
00:38:41.416 --> 00:38:42.707
Yes, I am.

582
00:38:42.708 --> 00:38:43.750
Can I help you?

583
00:38:47.041 --> 00:38:49.666
There are a few things
we need to inform you about.

584
00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:54.708
We are here to tell you...

585
00:38:56.375 --> 00:39:00.457
that we've lost contact
with the vessel commanded by...

586
00:39:00.458 --> 00:39:05.332
Captain Satya since they entered
the Sea of Japan two days ago.

587
00:39:05.333 --> 00:39:10.457
<i>This information came from the base
in Okinawa and from the GPS records.</i>

588
00:39:10.458 --> 00:39:14.457
<i>Captain Satya's vessel was hit...</i>

589
00:39:14.458 --> 00:39:18.000
<i>by a typhoon in the Sea of Japan.</i>

590
00:39:18.958 --> 00:39:23.000
<i>Thirty minutes before
our navigation system warned us.</i>

591
00:39:23.958 --> 00:39:27.124
<i>The Search and Rescue team
have been searching for them nonstop</i>

592
00:39:27.125 --> 00:39:28.833
<i>since yesterday.</i>

593
00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:28.750
What is it?

594
00:40:30.541 --> 00:40:32.083
It sank...

595
00:40:35.208 --> 00:40:37.500
Stop joking.

596
00:40:46.375 --> 00:40:50.249
<i>The sinking of the tanker vessel
owned by Eastern Shipping Company...</i>

597
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:55.040
<i>that was commanded by Captain Satya
has been the highlight of the news.</i>

598
00:40:55.041 --> 00:40:58.082
<i>Some public figures and politicians</i>

599
00:40:58.083 --> 00:41:00.374
<i>have been sending
their condolences and prayers</i>

600
00:41:00.375 --> 00:41:02.207
<i>through their social media accounts.</i>

601
00:41:02.208 --> 00:41:04.540
<i>Especially after getting confirmation
from the rescue team</i>

602
00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:06.208
<i>that they have concluded the search.</i>

603
00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:08.874
Why now, Dad?

604
00:41:08.875 --> 00:41:10.582
Mom.

605
00:41:10.583 --> 00:41:13.333
Dad... Dad is gone, Mom.

606
00:41:13.916 --> 00:41:15.541
- Dad...
- Come on.

607
00:41:20.916 --> 00:41:21.875
Mom...

608
00:41:26.791 --> 00:41:29.666
Calm down, Sir.

609
00:41:31.291 --> 00:41:32.415
Leave me alone!

610
00:41:32.416 --> 00:41:34.375
Leave me alone, assholes!

611
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:37.499
Why now...

612
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.875
Dad...

613
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.582
<i>The Bathyal Zone.</i>

614
00:41:45.583 --> 00:41:48.458
<i>It lies between
the light and the total darkness.</i>

615
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.957
<i>Everything seems confusing.</i>

616
00:41:50.958 --> 00:41:54.040
<i>Just like the news
that hit me like a ton of bricks.</i>

617
00:41:54.041 --> 00:41:55.915
<i>Dragging me deeper.</i>

618
00:41:55.916 --> 00:41:58.832
<i>Further from what I've been fighting for.</i>

619
00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:01.207
<i>My responsibility is getting bigger.</i>

620
00:42:01.208 --> 00:42:03.624
<i>And my shoulders are getting tired.</i>

621
00:42:03.625 --> 00:42:05.624
<i>Meanwhile, I don't even know...</i>

622
00:42:05.625 --> 00:42:07.665
<i>where it all leads.</i>

623
00:42:07.666 --> 00:42:09.415
TEN DAYS LATER
FOURTEEN DAYS BEFORE THE ANNIVERSARY

624
00:42:09.416 --> 00:42:11.832
Mr. Uta.

625
00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:13.291
Mr. Ian.

626
00:42:14.291 --> 00:42:17.083
On behalf of the company...

627
00:42:17.666 --> 00:42:22.416
we would like to offer you
our deepest condolences.

628
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.874
As we are very grateful...

629
00:42:26.875 --> 00:42:28.790
to Captain Satya.

630
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:32.374
He was the last man
who stayed on the vessel.

631
00:42:32.375 --> 00:42:34.000
And under his tremendous command...

632
00:42:34.666 --> 00:42:36.000
30 crew members of the vessel...

633
00:42:36.833 --> 00:42:38.500
were rescued.

634
00:42:39.625 --> 00:42:42.207
And as our gratitude,

635
00:42:42.208 --> 00:42:46.415
we have prepared death benefits...

636
00:42:46.416 --> 00:42:48.291
- in the form of...
- Wait.

637
00:42:50.416 --> 00:42:52.458
What do you mean by "Death Benefit"?

638
00:42:54.583 --> 00:42:56.999
Are you saying you're going
to pay some amount of money in exchange

639
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.290
for my father's life?

640
00:42:58.291 --> 00:43:00.041
- Is that it?
- Ta.

641
00:43:01.208 --> 00:43:04.165
I'm sorry, Sir.
But we're following the guidelines...

642
00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:05.707
where we have to stop searching
on day ten...

643
00:43:05.708 --> 00:43:08.416
Wow, wonderful.

644
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:14.457
The money won't bring
my father back from death!

645
00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:17.750
- Ta.
- He worked there for more than ten days...

646
00:43:19.166 --> 00:43:21.082
Maybe more than ten months...

647
00:43:21.083 --> 00:43:22.750
or even ten years.

648
00:43:23.416 --> 00:43:25.333
And you only give him ten days?

649
00:43:33.708 --> 00:43:37.083
You work in a nice office,
you don't know the risk of his profession.

650
00:43:41.083 --> 00:43:44.666
You don't know what he had been through,
far away from his children.

651
00:43:48.583 --> 00:43:51.500
Your jobs don't include that risk!

652
00:43:52.125 --> 00:43:54.708
And we don't need your compensation money!

653
00:43:59.958 --> 00:44:01.375
Thank you.

654
00:44:03.541 --> 00:44:04.541
Let's go.

655
00:44:08.916 --> 00:44:10.166
Hello, Uncle.

656
00:44:11.583 --> 00:44:14.374
So, the company where Dad worked said...

657
00:44:14.375 --> 00:44:16.041
there was a typhoon.

658
00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:20.583
The wind speed was around 250 km per hour.

659
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:24.375
It destroyed the engine room...

660
00:44:26.375 --> 00:44:28.250
and the vessel lost its balance.

661
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:35.083
They sent their people here to tell us...

662
00:44:36.166 --> 00:44:38.000
that Dad's tanker has sunk.

663
00:44:38.958 --> 00:44:41.333
They couldn't find his body.

664
00:44:43.333 --> 00:44:44.375
Yes, Uncle.

665
00:44:46.416 --> 00:44:47.625
How dare they show up here...

666
00:44:48.416 --> 00:44:50.000
and casually tell us...

667
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:52.208
that...

668
00:44:53.083 --> 00:44:56.291
Dad is gone?

669
00:45:02.375 --> 00:45:03.416
Dad was...

670
00:45:05.958 --> 00:45:08.290
Dad was well trained...

671
00:45:08.291 --> 00:45:10.333
for such situations.

672
00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:13.791
I can't just sit here and take the news.

673
00:45:17.458 --> 00:45:19.666
I want to stay optimistic.

674
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.958
That he wouldn't leave me alone like this.

675
00:45:24.375 --> 00:45:26.249
I don't know...

676
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.208
I don't know what to do.

677
00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:36.541
Neither do I.

678
00:45:40.666 --> 00:45:42.166
<i>I understand...</i>

679
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.416
<i>this situation is very hard
for both of you, Mr. Ian and Mr. Uta.</i>

680
00:45:48.416 --> 00:45:50.957
<i>But considering
Mrs. Dini's health condition...</i>

681
00:45:50.958 --> 00:45:55.957
<i>where we just did surgery
to put a pacemaker on her heart...</i>

682
00:45:55.958 --> 00:46:00.790
<i>we suggest you to avoid telling her
news that will affect her emotions.</i>

683
00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:04.583
Like surprise, stress,
or overwhelming feelings...

684
00:46:05.541 --> 00:46:07.416
whatever the trigger is.

685
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:11.333
Did your dad contact you?

686
00:46:16.083 --> 00:46:18.875
How do we keep the news from Mom?

687
00:46:19.458 --> 00:46:21.291
The news is everywhere.

688
00:46:24.458 --> 00:46:25.915
Has he contacted you?

689
00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:27.041
Not yet, Mom.

690
00:46:28.791 --> 00:46:31.582
It's okay, you should
update your dad anyway.

691
00:46:31.583 --> 00:46:33.041
- Okay?
- Yes, Mom.

692
00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:36.749
Tell him I'm fine.

693
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:39.749
I don't want your dad to be worried.

694
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:40.958
Okay.

695
00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.499
Since the news about Dad is
all over the national news...

696
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.083
reporters are waiting for us
outside our home.

697
00:46:48.708 --> 00:46:50.750
I heard people are
sending flowers to our home.

698
00:46:52.375 --> 00:46:53.541
What can we do?

699
00:46:56.916 --> 00:46:58.583
I just had a dream...

700
00:46:59.166 --> 00:47:01.249
our house was so crowded.

701
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:02.416
We had so many guests.

702
00:47:03.166 --> 00:47:05.540
Everybody was wearing white.

703
00:47:05.541 --> 00:47:07.166
What a strange dream.

704
00:47:12.541 --> 00:47:13.833
What's wrong with your brother?

705
00:47:15.208 --> 00:47:17.625
It's okay, Mom. Don't worry about him.

706
00:47:18.458 --> 00:47:19.458
Ray.

707
00:47:20.041 --> 00:47:21.333
Ray, I need your help.

708
00:47:23.333 --> 00:47:25.124
Call the boys.

709
00:47:25.125 --> 00:47:26.499
<i>Sir!</i>

710
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.750
<i>Make way! Move!</i>

711
00:47:31.041 --> 00:47:32.958
- Hey, make way!
- Sir!

712
00:47:35.625 --> 00:47:36.916
Sir!

713
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:43.916
Move!

714
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.457
Back off!

715
00:47:46.458 --> 00:47:50.415
<i>Ian, are you mad at me?</i>

716
00:47:50.416 --> 00:47:52.749
<i>Again, I'm so sorry.</i>

717
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.749
<i>Let's continue
our conversation before my next voyage.</i>

718
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:57.374
<i>Bye Ian. It's time for me to go.</i>

719
00:47:57.375 --> 00:47:58.666
<i>Please take care of
your mom and your brother for me.</i>

720
00:48:03.208 --> 00:48:05.207
Mr. Ian!

721
00:48:05.208 --> 00:48:07.249

MR. SATYA

730
00:49:43.166 --> 00:49:45.291
Okay. Sak, you go with me.

731
00:50:00.208 --> 00:50:01.250
Come on, lift it, help me.

732
00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:03.875
Let's go.

733
00:50:04.708 --> 00:50:06.416
- Are you good, Ian?
- I'm good.

734
00:50:07.833 --> 00:50:09.415
Can you lift it?

735
00:50:09.416 --> 00:50:10.875
Look out. Sak.

736
00:50:13.625 --> 00:50:15.500
- Ian.
- Sir!

737
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.374
- The one behind...
- Look out.

738
00:50:18.375 --> 00:50:19.707
Careful.

739
00:50:19.708 --> 00:50:21.625
Lift it.

740
00:50:29.291 --> 00:50:30.708
Can you watch the front?

741
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.290
<i>You don't want anybody to pray for him?</i>

742
00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:39.415
<i>What if your mom hears it
from other people. Oh, dear...</i>

743
00:50:39.416 --> 00:50:40.999
<i>Miss Yati.</i>

744
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.832
<i>It's okay, Ian knows better
about the situation there.</i>

745
00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:46.166
Yes, Uncle.

746
00:50:46.833 --> 00:50:49.832
That's why I'm asking you to
convey our request to all our relatives.

747
00:50:49.833 --> 00:50:52.375
Please don't send
anything or come to visit us.

748
00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:55.957
<i>If you need any help,
I will be there along with the rest.</i>

749
00:50:55.958 --> 00:50:57.208
Thank you, Uncle.

750
00:50:58.291 --> 00:50:59.416
Ian.

751
00:51:01.333 --> 00:51:03.707
Thank you for the thousands of condolence
messages for my Dad's passing...

752
00:51:03.708 --> 00:51:06.207
but from the bottom of my heart,
my family needs time to grieve...

753
00:51:06.208 --> 00:51:08.000
and I will step away from social media.

754
00:51:13.583 --> 00:51:14.624
Here, drink this.

755
00:51:14.625 --> 00:51:15.707
SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM
STOPPED THE SEARCH FOR CAPTAIN SATYA

756
00:51:15.708 --> 00:51:18.290
- You're acting like you're new here.
- Take it easy.

757
00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:21.500
I'm gonna go to Mom's room and prepare her
stuff to wear when she's being discharged.

758
00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:27.458
Say hi to Jeha, Dik.

759
00:51:28.666 --> 00:51:30.124
Her cooking is so good,
I finished it already.

760
00:51:30.125 --> 00:51:31.457
Tell it to her yourself.

761
00:51:31.458 --> 00:51:33.290
Thanks, Je.

762
00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:35.750
- I've finished it already.
- <i>You're welcome, Ian.</i>

763
00:51:36.333 --> 00:51:37.416
<i>I'm glad you like it.</i>

764
00:51:38.166 --> 00:51:40.707
<i>By the way, I'm sorry for your loss.</i>

765
00:51:40.708 --> 00:51:41.999
Thanks.

766
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.249
<i>Bye, guys.</i>

767
00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:45.208
<i>Bye, Ray.</i>

768
00:51:46.083 --> 00:51:48.625
<i>Bye, Saka. You're so quiet.</i>

769
00:51:49.625 --> 00:51:51.166
Tomorrow my mother will be discharged
from the hospital.

770
00:51:52.583 --> 00:51:54.832
I don't know what to tell her...

771
00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:56.166
when she starts asking about Dad.

772
00:51:57.291 --> 00:51:58.958
I'm not prepared with the answer.

773
00:52:00.333 --> 00:52:01.874
If I were you...

774
00:52:01.875 --> 00:52:04.166
I'd say anything to her.

775
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:06.500
As long as it's not harming her health.

776
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:09.625
How's the band?

777
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:11.875
The band?

778
00:52:13.083 --> 00:52:14.415
Yeah, about the band...

779
00:52:14.416 --> 00:52:15.915
a strange thing happened...

780
00:52:15.916 --> 00:52:17.290
because all of a sudden...

781
00:52:17.291 --> 00:52:18.749
there's an increase in people
who listen to our songs.

782
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:20.999
Our IG account got more followers.

783
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.124
We got more gig contracts.

784
00:52:23.125 --> 00:52:26.290
But now you need to be with your family.

785
00:52:26.291 --> 00:52:29.041
If you think it's all
under control, let us know.

786
00:52:32.458 --> 00:52:35.540
I don't like to see
our band suffer like this.

787
00:52:35.541 --> 00:52:36.791
Come here!

788
00:53:01.375 --> 00:53:04.791
Finally, I'm going home.

789
00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.375
Where's my bag?

790
00:53:10.166 --> 00:53:11.915
I'm holding it, Mom. What's wrong?

791
00:53:11.916 --> 00:53:13.540
Looking for something?

792
00:53:13.541 --> 00:53:15.499
It's okay, I'm just looking for my phone.

793
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.166
The doctor said...

794
00:53:17.958 --> 00:53:21.624
the phone will interfere
with your pacemaker.

795
00:53:21.625 --> 00:53:22.916
Because...

796
00:53:24.166 --> 00:53:25.332
- Because...
- Because of what?

797
00:53:25.333 --> 00:53:27.124
The phone emmits
electromagnetic radiation.

798
00:53:27.125 --> 00:53:28.916
She said it will
interfere with your pacemaker.

799
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:32.624
Are you saying I can't hold any phone
for the rest of my life?

800
00:53:32.625 --> 00:53:33.750
Mom.

801
00:53:34.416 --> 00:53:36.375
You just had a second heart attack.

802
00:53:37.416 --> 00:53:40.125
I don't want to see
you have another heart attack.

803
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:42.583
Please, Mom, just do as I said.

804
00:53:45.125 --> 00:53:47.166
Uta and I still need you.

805
00:53:48.583 --> 00:53:51.541
Then can you check my messages, Uta?

806
00:53:53.083 --> 00:53:54.915
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES...

807
00:53:54.916 --> 00:53:57.708
The neighbors wish you a speedy recovery.

808
00:53:58.291 --> 00:53:59.457
Your dad?

809
00:53:59.458 --> 00:54:00.791
Did he try to contact me?

810
00:54:02.666 --> 00:54:04.333
I sent him messages, Mom.

811
00:54:05.666 --> 00:54:08.916
I told him that you can't hold
any phone for the time being.

812
00:54:10.333 --> 00:54:11.625
Okay.

813
00:54:14.291 --> 00:54:16.249
Oh, my God!

814
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.707
How could you live with this mess?

815
00:54:18.708 --> 00:54:21.915
Is it so hard to put your trash in the bin?

816
00:54:21.916 --> 00:54:23.333
My goodness.

817
00:54:25.166 --> 00:54:26.540
Kids...

818
00:54:26.541 --> 00:54:29.332
I want to watch TV. Where's the remote?

819
00:54:29.333 --> 00:54:30.416
What, Mom?

820
00:54:31.041 --> 00:54:33.457
Where's the remote? I want to watch TV.

821
00:54:33.458 --> 00:54:34.832
What is it?

822
00:54:34.833 --> 00:54:37.707
Mom wants to watch
TV, she can't find the remote.

823
00:54:37.708 --> 00:54:38.999
Yeah, so?

824
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.415
She can't find the remote!

825
00:54:41.416 --> 00:54:43.666
- The remote!
- The remote!

826
00:54:44.625 --> 00:54:45.499
- Where is it?
- I'm so sorry, Mom.

827
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.374
I think you should stand up,
because I think you're sitting on it.

828
00:54:47.375 --> 00:54:50.040
- Just for a minute, Mom.
- The remote...

829
00:54:50.041 --> 00:54:52.957
If only you tidy up a bit...

830
00:54:52.958 --> 00:54:54.707
Where is it?

831
00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:57.165
I think it's around here somewhere.
Where is it?

832
00:54:57.166 --> 00:54:58.832
I can't find
the remote, but I found "martabak".

833
00:54:58.833 --> 00:55:00.207
Exactly, but where's the remote?

834
00:55:00.208 --> 00:55:01.915
- Where is it?
- Where's the remote...

835
00:55:01.916 --> 00:55:05.374
Is that the remote, Mom? No?

836
00:55:05.375 --> 00:55:06.540
- Where?
- It's...

837
00:55:06.541 --> 00:55:08.333
Did you put it here?

838
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.040
Exactly. I wonder where it is.

839
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:12.874
Oh, come on.

840
00:55:12.875 --> 00:55:14.665
- Are you...
- I think it's over there.

841
00:55:14.666 --> 00:55:16.457
Or maybe around there somewhere.

842
00:55:16.458 --> 00:55:19.625
That's why you need to clean the house.

843
00:55:20.458 --> 00:55:23.332
- Okay, okay...
- With all these leftovers piling up...

844
00:55:23.333 --> 00:55:26.458
it's impossible to find the remote.

845
00:55:29.083 --> 00:55:30.415
- What is it?
- This.

846
00:55:30.416 --> 00:55:32.291
- Mom...
- You found it?

847
00:55:36.416 --> 00:55:39.000
- Oh, my God.
- My goodness!

848
00:55:41.833 --> 00:55:44.582
- It' won't turn on.
- The cord is broken.

849
00:55:44.583 --> 00:55:47.207
- What's broken?
- The cord.

850
00:55:47.208 --> 00:55:48.707
The rat chewed on it, Mom!

851
00:55:48.708 --> 00:55:50.790
Forget it, I no longer want to watch TV.

852
00:55:50.791 --> 00:55:52.540
I just want to sleep.

853
00:55:52.541 --> 00:55:53.916
- Oh boy...
- Wait.

854
00:55:55.625 --> 00:55:57.124
But I can sleep later.

855
00:55:57.125 --> 00:55:58.249
Now what, Mom?

856
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:59.375
Ian.

857
00:56:00.083 --> 00:56:01.833
What’s the date today?

858
00:56:02.333 --> 00:56:04.499
It's February 2nd, Mom. Why do you ask?

859
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:07.916
Our wedding anniversary is two weeks away!

860
00:56:08.916 --> 00:56:10.750
I want to give him a surprise.

861
00:56:11.333 --> 00:56:13.916
Did he ever tell you
what he wants for a gift?

862
00:56:15.125 --> 00:56:16.291
It's a surprise.

863
00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.457
Fine.

864
00:56:19.458 --> 00:56:21.249
Clean the house!

865
00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:23.333
- Okay.
- Promise?

866
00:56:24.125 --> 00:56:25.166
Okay.

867
00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:27.290
Mom...

868
00:56:27.291 --> 00:56:29.166
if she tells us to call Dad...

869
00:56:30.208 --> 00:56:33.499
- what should we do?
- Just tell her, he has no service or...

870
00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:34.624
Moron.

871
00:56:34.625 --> 00:56:36.957
You know they have a Wi-Fi connection
on his tanker.

872
00:56:36.958 --> 00:56:39.875
- Shit...
- Help me think.

873
00:56:41.041 --> 00:56:43.624
What if she's not only
going to ask us to call Dad?

874
00:56:43.625 --> 00:56:45.749
What if she went ahead...

875
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.790
and asks directly to the company?

876
00:56:47.791 --> 00:56:50.500
I don't know! I have no idea.

877
00:57:25.291 --> 00:57:26.541
<i>Neritic Zone.</i>

878
00:57:27.208 --> 00:57:30.082
<i>Part of the ocean
that light can still penetrate.</i>

879
00:57:30.083 --> 00:57:33.458
<i>Too bad, still full of uncertainty.</i>

880
00:57:34.666 --> 00:57:37.625
<i>I thought I could finally find my way out.</i>

881
00:57:38.458 --> 00:57:41.374
<i>But I'm so focused on my fear.</i>

882
00:57:41.375 --> 00:57:43.958
<i>I forgot to take a break.</i>

883
00:57:45.083 --> 00:57:48.541
<i>I've been chasing great things
for so long and was in too deep...</i>

884
00:57:49.291 --> 00:57:50.832
<i>that I'm ignoring...</i>

885
00:57:50.833 --> 00:57:53.207
<i>everything close to me.</i>

886
00:57:53.208 --> 00:57:54.749
DAD

887
00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:57.000
<i>Sorry for taking too long to call.</i>

888
00:57:57.583 --> 00:57:59.540
<i>The reception here is not very good.</i>

889
00:57:59.541 --> 00:58:01.665
<i>Not strong enough to make a video call.</i>

890
00:58:01.666 --> 00:58:03.500
It's okay, Honey.

891
00:58:04.416 --> 00:58:05.625
I...

892
00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:08.833
I'm actually bored.

893
00:58:09.458 --> 00:58:10.583
But, well...

894
00:58:11.208 --> 00:58:12.624
I think...

895
00:58:12.625 --> 00:58:15.540
the kids are now very protective of me.

896
00:58:15.541 --> 00:58:17.165
DAD

897
00:58:17.166 --> 00:58:18.707
Well...

898
00:58:18.708 --> 00:58:21.250
it's for your own health.

899
00:58:22.458 --> 00:58:25.624
<i>I know.</i>

900
00:58:25.625 --> 00:58:27.125
<i>How are you doing there?</i>

901
00:58:28.166 --> 00:58:29.332
I'm good.

902
00:58:29.333 --> 00:58:30.957
<i>I just want to tell you</i>

903
00:58:30.958 --> 00:58:34.540
<i>that you don't have to worry
about my health.</i>

904
00:58:34.541 --> 00:58:38.625
I can't help it.

905
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:44.000
But the kids are always updating...

906
00:58:45.166 --> 00:58:47.250
about your condition regularly.

907
00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:50.583
So, yeah...

908
00:58:52.333 --> 00:58:54.166
it helps me to be less worried.

909
00:58:56.625 --> 00:58:58.000
By the way, Honey.

910
00:58:59.583 --> 00:59:02.457
<i>Our anniversary is coming.</i>

911
00:59:02.458 --> 00:59:04.208
<i>Quarter century!</i>

912
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.375
I can't wait.
You're coming home for that, right?

913
00:59:11.416 --> 00:59:12.458
Of course.

914
00:59:15.833 --> 00:59:17.625
I can't wait either.

915
00:59:19.416 --> 00:59:20.500
Now...

916
00:59:21.708 --> 00:59:23.333
you should rest.

917
00:59:25.166 --> 00:59:26.583
I have to get ready.

918
00:59:28.041 --> 00:59:30.207
<i>It's almost my shift.</i>

919
00:59:30.208 --> 00:59:31.749
Okay.

920
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:34.291
See you in 11 days.

921
00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:37.458
See you at home.

922
00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:40.791
Love you, Hon.

923
00:59:41.916 --> 00:59:43.625
I love you too, Hon.

924
00:59:53.166 --> 00:59:54.541
You look sad.

925
00:59:56.041 --> 00:59:57.707
I'm fine...

926
00:59:57.708 --> 00:59:59.291
I just miss Dad.

927
01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:05.500
Forgive me, Dad.

928
01:00:16.125 --> 01:00:17.333
Ian!

929
01:00:21.125 --> 01:00:24.290
- What?
- Why did you give Mom an empty promise?

930
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:26.207
Why did you say to her, "See you at home"?

931
01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:27.749
Are you out of your mind?

932
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:29.708
Did you see her face when I said that?

933
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:31.958
She looked happy, right?

934
01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.165
Isn't that what you want, Ta?

935
01:00:35.166 --> 01:00:37.457
Hey, our job is to keep her happy.

936
01:00:37.458 --> 01:00:39.832
We just need to wait
for the right time to tell her...

937
01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:41.625
When's the right time?

938
01:00:44.666 --> 01:00:46.875
Their anniversary is coming.

939
01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:51.125
Are you going to tell her
on their anniversary day?

940
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:55.207
What if, after she finds out...

941
01:00:55.208 --> 01:00:59.290
her condition gets worse
and the thing we fear the most happens...

942
01:00:59.291 --> 01:01:00.958
- and you...
- If you want out...

943
01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:02.708
then fine.

944
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.541
I have no problem with that.

945
01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:07.374
I can do it all myself.

946
01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:10.457
I can use my laptop,
I can download the app.

947
01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:12.666
I will set it up to mimic Dad's voice,
plug in the mic, done.

948
01:02:45.958 --> 01:02:47.208
Ian.

949
01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:49.791
You don't sleep here often.

950
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.707
It doesn't have to be that way.
They have to understand

951
01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:30.749
the situation I'm in right now.

952
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:34.749
They can't expect me to make content
while I'm still grieving.

953
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:37.165
How could they be that cold?
Let me tell you something.

954
01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:40.082
Just cancel the show. I'll pay the penalty.

955
01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:41.790
Let me handle everything.

956
01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:43.707
I need time out.

957
01:03:43.708 --> 01:03:45.332
I just can't be bothered.

958
01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:46.833
Okay? Bye.

959
01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:52.833
Hey.

960
01:03:55.416 --> 01:03:56.915
What did I tell you?

961
01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:58.291
Close the door.

962
01:03:59.625 --> 01:04:00.665
Why?

963
01:04:00.666 --> 01:04:02.083
Mom could hear you talk.

964
01:04:04.791 --> 01:04:06.832
What is Dad's scarf doing here?

965
01:04:06.833 --> 01:04:08.083
Where's Dad's box?

966
01:04:09.583 --> 01:04:11.124
Yesterday I tried to cover it with...

967
01:04:11.125 --> 01:04:13.166
Are you going to cover the box with that?

968
01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.833
Put the scarf inside the box.

969
01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:28.000
You have to cover it thoroughly.
So when Mom comes in, she won't see it.

970
01:04:28.958 --> 01:04:30.500
- There you go.
- Okay.

971
01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.416
WHEN WILL YOU
START PRODUCING CONTENT AGAIN?

972
01:04:45.791 --> 01:04:47.750
How long are you gonna take
a sabbatical leave?

973
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:50.166
I don't know.

974
01:04:51.666 --> 01:04:54.540
How would Dad feel if he knew...

975
01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:57.958
his sons are feeling like crap right now?

976
01:05:05.291 --> 01:05:06.958
I almost forgot.

977
01:05:08.125 --> 01:05:09.208
Bro.

978
01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:11.625
It's about Dad's song...

979
01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.582
I can't stop thinking about it.

980
01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:17.874
The last assignment he gave to us
was to finish his song.

981
01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:19.541
I tried...

982
01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:22.374
to do it alone, but...

983
01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:25.165
I don't know. I'm not that good...

984
01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:26.957
with my guitar skills.

985
01:05:26.958 --> 01:05:28.416
What do you think?

986
01:05:31.208 --> 01:05:32.957
ONLY YOUR NAME IN MY PRAYERS

987
01:05:32.958 --> 01:05:33.916
What do you think?

988
01:05:41.458 --> 01:05:44.290
What is that?
Just tell me the truth if it's that bad.

989
01:05:44.291 --> 01:05:45.958
Don't just mumble.

990
01:05:46.708 --> 01:05:48.166
Weird.

991
01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:58.915
What are you doing?

992
01:05:58.916 --> 01:06:01.250
You said you want to finish Dad's song?

993
01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:46.958
ONLY YOUR NAME IN MY PRAYERS

994
01:06:54.083 --> 01:06:56.540
WHEN THE EYES DECIDED

995
01:06:56.541 --> 01:06:59.124
COMING HOME BECOMES MEANINGFUL

996
01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:00.416
Uta.

997
01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:02.666
Uta.

998
01:07:03.666 --> 01:07:06.165
- Why is the door locked?
- Yeah, just a moment!

999
01:07:06.166 --> 01:07:09.166
- Why is the door locked?
- Hang on, Mom. I'm recording!

1000
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:10.708
Yes.

1001
01:07:14.541 --> 01:07:15.625
Yes?

1002
01:07:17.041 --> 01:07:19.041
Now you love to lock your door?

1003
01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:21.833
What is it, Mom?

1004
01:07:22.416 --> 01:07:24.665
Do I see both of you in the same room?

1005
01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.665
This is what I like!

1006
01:07:26.666 --> 01:07:29.166
You're making us happy.

1007
01:07:31.958 --> 01:07:34.249
Anyway, I just want to let you know...

1008
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:38.999
Dinda and I are
going to Mayestik tomorrow.

1009
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.166
- You're feeling better already?
- Yeah!

1010
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:43.250
- Mom.
- Okay?

1011
01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:48.416
- We're doomed.
- Shit.

1012
01:07:51.125 --> 01:07:52.208
Come here, quick.

1013
01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:07.583
Let's go to Junior Rajut first.

1014
01:08:08.541 --> 01:08:11.707
I know a new place. But it's that way.

1015
01:08:11.708 --> 01:08:13.708
Yeah, it's that way. It's a good store too.

1016
01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:27.208
Where is it? But we can window shop
while I'm searching for the store.

1017
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:35.707
- Jun.
- You're Mrs. Dini's daughter, right?

1018
01:08:35.708 --> 01:08:37.291
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1019
01:08:38.083 --> 01:08:39.915
- What's going on here?
- Shut up!

1020
01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:43.040
Mom doesn't know Dad's gone.
Jun, when she gets here...

1021
01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:45.624
just pretend you don't know anything.
Pretend you have amnesia.

1022
01:08:45.625 --> 01:08:48.249
Wake up! Shut up!

1023
01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:49.500
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1024
01:08:50.666 --> 01:08:52.040
- I'm not kidding.
- Okay.

1025
01:08:52.041 --> 01:08:53.624
I've unplugged Jun's TV.

1026
01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:54.874
We're clear.

1027
01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:57.207
When did you get the hypnotic skill?

1028
01:08:57.208 --> 01:08:59.041
There are many things
you don't know about me.

1029
01:09:06.916 --> 01:09:08.000
Let's go, Ta. Move.

1030
01:09:09.458 --> 01:09:12.374
<i>Beside the heroic act by Captain Satya...</i>

1031
01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:14.415
Ta!

1032
01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:15.790
Oh, no.

1033
01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:17.999
<i>...shared by his surviving crew members
and his close relatives...</i>

1034
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.875
<i>...who retold them through social media.</i>

1035
01:09:23.041 --> 01:09:24.125
What should we do?

1036
01:09:35.041 --> 01:09:36.333
I can't cut it!

1037
01:09:37.583 --> 01:09:38.708
Let's go.

1038
01:09:43.208 --> 01:09:45.790
Somebody cut all the TV cords!

1039
01:09:45.791 --> 01:09:47.415
Your TV is broken too?

1040
01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:49.624
- Dead?
- Who cut all the cords?

1041
01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:50.874
I don't know.

1042
01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:52.707
I'd like to buy this yarn...

1043
01:09:52.708 --> 01:09:55.249
- Is this...
- I don't know. I don't know nothing.

1044
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:57.249
I don't understand.

1045
01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:59.000
I don't know anything.

1046
01:09:59.916 --> 01:10:01.416
I don't know.

1047
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.707
Din, let's go to your store.

1048
01:10:03.708 --> 01:10:06.915
I think there's something wrong with Jun.
I don't know why, he's acting strange.

1049
01:10:06.916 --> 01:10:08.125
Let's go!

1050
01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:12.083
We are told to go there.

1051
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:13.916
To the Hanyut Kain store...

1052
01:10:14.916 --> 01:10:15.833
Let's go.

1053
01:10:18.458 --> 01:10:20.457
Ouch!

1054
01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:21.665
Oh my God.

1055
01:10:21.666 --> 01:10:23.124
Where are you going?

1056
01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:24.915
These are imported bras!

1057
01:10:24.916 --> 01:10:26.832
Watch where you're going!

1058
01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:28.083
You don't see us?

1059
01:10:44.083 --> 01:10:45.624
Guys?

1060
01:10:45.625 --> 01:10:47.207
What are you doing here?

1061
01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:49.374
- Uta asked me to come.
- Why didn't you tell me?

1062
01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:51.290
We could have come here together.

1063
01:10:51.291 --> 01:10:52.500
It was last minute.

1064
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.749
She's singing your song.

1065
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.791
She told me it's your song.

1066
01:10:59.166 --> 01:11:00.374
How do you know the song?

1067
01:11:00.375 --> 01:11:03.624
It's going viral.
On Twitter and on Instagram.

1068
01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:05.374
You should open your TikTok app!

1069
01:11:05.375 --> 01:11:08.125
There. Your band is famous!

1070
01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:11.040
- Are you a celeb?
- No, I'm not...

1071
01:11:11.041 --> 01:11:12.374
Oh, my God!

1072
01:11:12.375 --> 01:11:14.499
Can I take your picture?
You're Angga Yunanda, right?

1073
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.540
- No, I'm not!
- Okay, okay.

1074
01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:17.915
- It's my sister's birthday today.
- Do you want to go home with us?

1075
01:11:17.916 --> 01:11:19.249
No, later...

1076
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:21.124
- Later... We... we have a car.
- We have a car.

1077
01:11:21.125 --> 01:11:22.124
We'll be fine.

1078
01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:23.624
See you, guys. Go straight home, okay?

1079
01:11:23.625 --> 01:11:24.999
Okay!

1080
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.166
Din...

1081
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:33.290
TRENDING THIS WEEK

1082
01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:35.749
Make a song like this. Can you?

1083
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:37.207
- Of course.
- Sure.

1084
01:11:37.208 --> 01:11:39.832
It's a rock song,
but you can still dance to it.

1085
01:11:39.833 --> 01:11:41.083
What?

1086
01:11:43.208 --> 01:11:45.082
Leon?

1087
01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:46.249
Hello.

1088
01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:48.707
- Leon, this is Ray.
- Saka.

1089
01:11:48.708 --> 01:11:50.415
- Can we talk?
- What?

1090
01:11:50.416 --> 01:11:52.624
Can we talk?

1091
01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:55.040
- Sure.
- Let's go.

1092
01:11:55.041 --> 01:11:56.707
But I thought yesterday...

1093
01:11:56.708 --> 01:11:58.874
Let's go!

1094
01:11:58.875 --> 01:12:02.083
Major label, Boss!

1095
01:12:04.583 --> 01:12:07.457
Guys, congrats on your viral songs.

1096
01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:09.207
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1097
01:12:09.208 --> 01:12:10.875
Are you free tomorrow?

1098
01:12:21.958 --> 01:12:24.082
Worry.

1099
01:12:24.083 --> 01:12:25.333
- What rhymes with worry?
- Worry.

1100
01:12:30.291 --> 01:12:31.415
What are you doing here?

1101
01:12:31.416 --> 01:12:34.165
Well this is my brother's room.
What's wrong with that?

1102
01:12:34.166 --> 01:12:36.415
I don't see you here often.
But that's okay. Where's Ian?

1103
01:12:36.416 --> 01:12:37.750
What is it?

1104
01:12:38.416 --> 01:12:40.999
You won't believe who's downstairs.

1105
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.374
Who?

1106
01:12:42.375 --> 01:12:44.582
I forgot his name.

1107
01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:48.124
But he's talking to your band members
and your mother downstairs.

1108
01:12:48.125 --> 01:12:49.291
Oh, shit!

1109
01:12:55.791 --> 01:12:57.083
That's all, Auntie.

1110
01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:00.291
Leon?

1111
01:13:01.375 --> 01:13:02.416
I see.

1112
01:13:03.416 --> 01:13:05.582
- We're okay.
- Mom.

1113
01:13:05.583 --> 01:13:06.625
Ian?

1114
01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:09.832
Ian.

1115
01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:12.290
Why didn't you tell me?

1116
01:13:12.291 --> 01:13:13.791
About what?

1117
01:13:16.541 --> 01:13:20.625
A major label is offering you a contract.
Why didn't you accept it?

1118
01:13:23.291 --> 01:13:25.999
Well, it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.

1119
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.833
You know it has been your father's dream.

1120
01:13:30.791 --> 01:13:33.208
He must be very proud of you.

1121
01:13:34.333 --> 01:13:36.666
I'll tell him.

1122
01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:42.624
Or maybe...

1123
01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:45.249
you can make him a drink.
I don't see any glasses on the table.

1124
01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.832
My goodness. I'm so sorry.

1125
01:13:47.833 --> 01:13:49.582
- It's okay, Ma'am.
- I'm so sorry.

1126
01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:52.583
- I'll be right back.
- Green tea latte, if you don't mind.

1127
01:13:56.208 --> 01:14:01.165
Now, Ian... I'm sorry we haven't
had a chance to tell you.

1128
01:14:01.166 --> 01:14:04.165
We couldn't find the perfect timing
to tell you since yesterday.

1129
01:14:04.166 --> 01:14:05.458
Sorry to interrupt.

1130
01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:09.082
You didn't tell my mother...

1131
01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:11.249
about my dad, right?

1132
01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:12.582
Of course not.

1133
01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:16.207
It's okay. I told Leon about
your situation and condition.

1134
01:14:16.208 --> 01:14:18.874
Great. Keep it up.

1135
01:14:18.875 --> 01:14:20.957
Now, you don't worry.

1136
01:14:20.958 --> 01:14:25.916
Me and my boss Mr. Beni
will take care of you through the process.

1137
01:14:27.833 --> 01:14:28.958
What do you say?

1138
01:14:31.791 --> 01:14:32.666
Deal?

1139
01:14:42.083 --> 01:14:43.916
Welcome to Dailywaves Records.

1140
01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:47.332
And congrats,
as of today, you're officially signed.

1141
01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:50.874
You can meet Mr. Beni upstairs.
Just say yes to him.

1142
01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:52.624
Can you turn up the vocal volume?

1143
01:14:52.625 --> 01:14:53.707
Well, this is when...

1144
01:14:53.708 --> 01:14:55.415
Now, this is more like it. It's balanced.

1145
01:14:55.416 --> 01:14:56.874
- Hang on.
- Guys.

1146
01:14:56.875 --> 01:14:58.290
- Meet Mr. Beni.
- Hello.

1147
01:14:58.291 --> 01:14:59.290
Sir.

1148
01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:01.207
He's the Head Producer
of Dailywaves Records.

1149
01:15:01.208 --> 01:15:02.624
- Hello.
- Beni.

1150
01:15:02.625 --> 01:15:03.665
- Saka.
- Beni.

1151
01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:04.915
Wow.

1152
01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:07.374
- Sir, is that...
- Yes.

1153
01:15:07.375 --> 01:15:09.833
I've heard all your music.

1154
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:12.249
Your music is authentic...

1155
01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:15.290
But you also have a mainstream appeal.

1156
01:15:15.291 --> 01:15:16.457
I think that’s a great combo.

1157
01:15:16.458 --> 01:15:18.125
Wow, that's crazy.

1158
01:15:18.833 --> 01:15:21.665
You can be more popular...

1159
01:15:21.666 --> 01:15:24.290
if you play songs like...

1160
01:15:24.291 --> 01:15:25.500
your song <i>Ocean</i>.

1161
01:15:26.583 --> 01:15:27.790
<i>Ocean</i>?

1162
01:15:27.791 --> 01:15:28.874
What do you mean?

1163
01:15:28.875 --> 01:15:30.916
You know, ballads.

1164
01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:35.915
That will set your bands identity.

1165
01:15:35.916 --> 01:15:38.040
- But we actually already have...
- Listen.

1166
01:15:38.041 --> 01:15:40.624
Hey, listen. Take notes.

1167
01:15:40.625 --> 01:15:43.999
Get your production
team ready to make ballads.

1168
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.541
- Okay?
- Yes, Sir.

1169
01:15:47.166 --> 01:15:48.875
Cool. Very cool.

1170
01:15:50.333 --> 01:15:52.041
- Thank you, Sir.
- Thank you, Sir.

1171
01:16:01.458 --> 01:16:03.291
Thank goodness.

1172
01:16:04.541 --> 01:16:08.624
That's why we should
go to Ian's gig someday.

1173
01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:12.207
How come we've never watched
our son's performance?

1174
01:16:12.208 --> 01:16:17.500
<i>Is that the reason he feels like
there's a distance between us?</i>

1175
01:16:18.166 --> 01:16:19.250
<i>Maybe...</i>

1176
01:16:19.916 --> 01:16:21.540
<i>he thinks we...</i>

1177
01:16:21.541 --> 01:16:24.250
can't understand his world?

1178
01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:27.666
Are you...

1179
01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.083
proud of him?

1180
01:16:32.958 --> 01:16:34.291
Of course.

1181
01:16:35.541 --> 01:16:37.290
What kind of question is that?

1182
01:16:37.291 --> 01:16:39.374
<i>That's a weird question.</i>

1183
01:16:39.375 --> 01:16:43.957
<i>I just hope that both my children
will have successful lives.</i>

1184
01:16:43.958 --> 01:16:46.791
<i>And they're happy.</i>

1185
01:16:50.041 --> 01:16:52.332
When you signed
the contract with that label...

1186
01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:54.458
had you thought it through?

1187
01:16:55.041 --> 01:16:57.082
With the current situation...

1188
01:16:57.083 --> 01:17:00.000
- how about Mom?
- We're gonna be okay.

1189
01:17:01.458 --> 01:17:02.500
We're gonna be okay, Din.

1190
01:17:03.333 --> 01:17:06.874
You saw it too yesterday, Din,
look at her when she met Leon.

1191
01:17:06.875 --> 01:17:08.707
She looked so happy.

1192
01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:10.874
That's the point, Din.

1193
01:17:10.875 --> 01:17:12.915
So it will help her recovery,

1194
01:17:12.916 --> 01:17:14.540
good for her heart,

1195
01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:16.749
and at the same time

1196
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:18.957
I can still pursue my dreams...

1197
01:17:18.958 --> 01:17:21.541
and I can make my
dad's last dream come true.

1198
01:17:23.791 --> 01:17:26.540
Fine, okay.

1199
01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.291
Just don't forget...

1200
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.208
you and Uta
should finish your father's song.

1201
01:17:32.708 --> 01:17:35.208
And I hope you can
trust your judgement, Ian.

1202
01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:39.333
That your new label
does want your band to grow.

1203
01:17:41.625 --> 01:17:43.250
Not just...

1204
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:49.041
Not just what?

1205
01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:53.999
Time for meds.

1206
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.750
- I'll put them here.
- Okay.

1207
01:17:56.791 --> 01:17:58.207
- Honey.
- Yes?

1208
01:17:58.208 --> 01:17:59.916
I'm making a blanket for your father.

1209
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:02.375
What do you think?

1210
01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:08.374
So, if he gets cold on the ship,
he can wear this.

1211
01:18:08.375 --> 01:18:09.666
Nice, right?

1212
01:18:11.791 --> 01:18:14.333
Do you think he will like this color?

1213
01:18:20.125 --> 01:18:21.707
The test results.

1214
01:18:21.708 --> 01:18:24.208
- Hang on. Let me read it.
- Sure.

1215
01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:27.957
Is it good?

1216
01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:30.250
HEART

1217
01:18:31.958 --> 01:18:33.916
Good?

1218
01:18:35.166 --> 01:18:36.333
Well?

1219
01:18:37.041 --> 01:18:39.583
Okay.

1220
01:18:41.666 --> 01:18:43.083
Why are you smiling, Mom?

1221
01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:45.625
What did Dr. Santi tell you?

1222
01:18:47.625 --> 01:18:49.582
She prescribed you some medicine...

1223
01:18:49.583 --> 01:18:51.791
and the instructions.

1224
01:18:52.625 --> 01:18:54.416
But why did she tell me to wait outside?

1225
01:18:57.833 --> 01:19:00.250
Whether it's good news or bad news,
you should tell me.

1226
01:19:02.208 --> 01:19:03.707
You know how I feel...

1227
01:19:03.708 --> 01:19:06.125
about being lied to by my kids.

1228
01:19:10.833 --> 01:19:11.916
Okay.

1229
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:15.415
Everything's fine.

1230
01:19:15.416 --> 01:19:17.166
Okay, great.

1231
01:19:18.833 --> 01:19:20.083
Delay?

1232
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:22.832
But why?

1233
01:19:22.833 --> 01:19:24.290
<i>I know...</i>

1234
01:19:24.291 --> 01:19:26.874
<i>But I have to cross the Red Sea.</i>

1235
01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:27.875
<i>I need to do a re-route.</i>

1236
01:19:28.458 --> 01:19:31.000
<i>They're giving me a new route.</i>

1237
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.915
I forgot to tell you yesterday.

1238
01:19:33.916 --> 01:19:37.541
Does that mean you won't
be home on our anniversary?

1239
01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:41.500
I'm afraid so.

1240
01:19:45.375 --> 01:19:47.708
You don't have to wait for me anymore.

1241
01:19:55.125 --> 01:19:57.040
Din, can you hold the phone for me?

1242
01:19:57.041 --> 01:19:58.583
- I need to go to the toilet.
- Okay, give it to me.

1243
01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:00.583
Hang on, Mom.

1244
01:20:03.583 --> 01:20:08.166
What do you mean I don't have
to wait for you anymore?

1245
01:20:09.375 --> 01:20:12.083
I'm gonna be home later than you expect.

1246
01:20:12.833 --> 01:20:15.458
So please, don't wait for me.

1247
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.208
<i>Okay.</i>

1248
01:20:19.416 --> 01:20:20.332
<i>Miss you, Hon.</i>

1249
01:20:20.333 --> 01:20:21.875
<i>Miss you too, Honey.</i>

1250
01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:35.125
Don't you think
she's going to get more suspicious?

1251
01:20:39.916 --> 01:20:41.874
How's the test report of her health?

1252
01:20:41.875 --> 01:20:44.749
If there is nothing to be worried about,
let's just tell her the truth so...

1253
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:45.875
No!

1254
01:20:48.916 --> 01:20:50.832
I talked with the doctor.

1255
01:20:50.833 --> 01:20:53.958
She said Mom's getting better.

1256
01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:56.333
But then she said...

1257
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.291
we'd better hold
the truth from her longer.

1258
01:21:01.625 --> 01:21:02.790
She's afraid it will
compromise her health.

1259
01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:05.499
She's getting better, but don't tell her
the truth? What does that even mean?

1260
01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.208
Just do what the doctor says!

1261
01:21:08.208 --> 01:21:09.791
And I need a favor.

1262
01:21:10.916 --> 01:21:13.499
Go to the pharmacy tomorrow,
and get Mom's meds.

1263
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.457
I went there but
they ran out of some of her meds.

1264
01:21:15.458 --> 01:21:16.750
Why don't you?

1265
01:21:17.458 --> 01:21:20.250
I have to do an intensive rehearsal,
starting tomorrow, Ta.

1266
01:21:22.541 --> 01:21:23.874
Ta!

1267
01:21:23.875 --> 01:21:25.124
What?

1268
01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:27.083
You know damn well, Ta...

1269
01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:30.958
how important
the Resonate stage is for me.

1270
01:21:31.708 --> 01:21:33.625
Does it mean Mom is not as important?

1271
01:21:34.791 --> 01:21:35.833
Ta.

1272
01:21:51.083 --> 01:21:54.749
We can't make a so-so song for Resonate.

1273
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:57.207
So, right now we have Andi Rianto...

1274
01:21:57.208 --> 01:21:58.874
and Mr. Monty Tiwa.

1275
01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:02.499
What kind of songs do you want them to
write for you? Songs like Raisa's, Rosa's?

1276
01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.540
Oh my...

1277
01:22:03.541 --> 01:22:06.332
You look just like rock stars...

1278
01:22:06.333 --> 01:22:09.165
how about the song <i>Jablay</i>?
Like in the movie <i>Mendadak Dangdut</i>.

1279
01:22:09.166 --> 01:22:12.999
Oh, we have to discuss it
within the band. Because...

1280
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.041
<i>I know, but I don't think
you have much time to do that.</i>

1281
01:22:35.333 --> 01:22:38.124
- We don't even know the process.
- Ghost writer, ghost producer.

1282
01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:39.874
It not unusual in this industry, Ray.

1283
01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:42.499
But they don't fit with our style.

1284
01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:45.333
And if you break the contract,
there's a penalty.

1285
01:22:54.125 --> 01:22:57.333
WHEN CAN YOU FINISH DAD'S SONG WITH ME?

1286
01:23:18.083 --> 01:23:23.040
<i>The story about Ian
and late Captain Satya...</i>

1287
01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:25.665
<i>touched so many people's hearts.</i>

1288
01:23:25.666 --> 01:23:28.374
<i>We have to maintain the momentum.</i>

1289
01:23:28.375 --> 01:23:29.916
<i>We're all going to profit from it.</i>

1290
01:24:11.166 --> 01:24:12.250
Are you okay, Ian?

1291
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:15.500
Are you okay?

1292
01:24:20.666 --> 01:24:22.540
Why do I feel they're taking...

1293
01:24:22.541 --> 01:24:24.749
Guys, announcement from Mr. Beni.

1294
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:25.875
Are you ready?

1295
01:24:27.125 --> 01:24:29.040
Midnight Serenade...

1296
01:24:29.041 --> 01:24:30.582
special lineup...

1297
01:24:30.583 --> 01:24:32.541
in Resonate Fest!

1298
01:24:34.625 --> 01:24:36.958
Resonate Fest!

1299
01:24:37.875 --> 01:24:39.665
This is great news!

1300
01:24:39.666 --> 01:24:41.875
It's the art of lobbying.

1301
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.790
- Mr. Uta.
- Doctor.

1302
01:24:49.791 --> 01:24:51.540
- Hello.
- Are you here to get the medicine?

1303
01:24:51.541 --> 01:24:52.666
Yes.

1304
01:24:53.833 --> 01:24:55.375
How is she doing?

1305
01:24:56.041 --> 01:24:59.041
Have you told her about Mr. Satya?

1306
01:25:00.166 --> 01:25:01.916
What do you mean?

1307
01:25:11.958 --> 01:25:13.957
Your kids are growing up now.

1308
01:25:13.958 --> 01:25:15.415
Time flies.

1309
01:25:15.416 --> 01:25:17.790
Hey, Ian. Come here!

1310
01:25:17.791 --> 01:25:18.875
Come here.

1311
01:25:20.416 --> 01:25:21.707
Say hello.

1312
01:25:21.708 --> 01:25:23.041
Come on.

1313
01:25:26.333 --> 01:25:28.166
- Uncle.
- How are you?

1314
01:25:28.875 --> 01:25:29.708
Auntie.

1315
01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:31.333
Elin.

1316
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:32.915
Elang.

1317
01:25:32.916 --> 01:25:34.540
I'll go get your drinks.

1318
01:25:34.541 --> 01:25:36.124
No, don't worry about us.

1319
01:25:36.125 --> 01:25:38.165
I'll be right back.

1320
01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:41.000
Elin and Elang,
can you help Auntie prepare the drinks?

1321
01:25:45.666 --> 01:25:47.083
Auntie, Uncle.

1322
01:25:47.958 --> 01:25:50.000
- Can we talk in private?
- Sure.

1323
01:25:50.833 --> 01:25:52.582
Ian, here.

1324
01:25:52.583 --> 01:25:54.874
The sample, you should check it first.

1325
01:25:54.875 --> 01:25:56.750
Is it okay for you?

1326
01:25:57.875 --> 01:25:59.000
Uncle.

1327
01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:01.708
What's the occasion?

1328
01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:06.540
You don't know that we agreed
to tell your mother about your dad today?

1329
01:26:06.541 --> 01:26:08.375
- Who said that?
- I did.

1330
01:26:09.666 --> 01:26:10.833
What?

1331
01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.207
You lied to me too.

1332
01:26:13.208 --> 01:26:14.124
You told me
even with her current condition

1333
01:26:14.125 --> 01:26:15.665
we still can't tell Mom about Dad.

1334
01:26:15.666 --> 01:26:16.915
And then what did I find out?
I talked to Dr. Santi.

1335
01:26:16.916 --> 01:26:17.832
Why didn't you tell me?

1336
01:26:17.833 --> 01:26:18.874
Well, you lied to me.

1337
01:26:18.875 --> 01:26:20.332
You need to talk to me
before making decisions, Ta!

1338
01:26:20.333 --> 01:26:23.665
Ian, sooner or later
we need to tell your mother.

1339
01:26:23.666 --> 01:26:26.165
What are you waiting for?
Look at your poor mother!

1340
01:26:26.166 --> 01:26:28.124
- Just not today.
- Auntie and Uncle...

1341
01:26:28.125 --> 01:26:31.040
as her siblings, you can't expect us to
just let our sister be left in the dark.

1342
01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:32.249
Uncle, I understand.

1343
01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:33.791
Just don't do it today.

1344
01:26:34.541 --> 01:26:36.874
I have things to do. Important stuff.

1345
01:26:36.875 --> 01:26:38.082
Hey, are you crazy or something?

1346
01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:40.958
What's more important to
you than your family? Selfish bastard.

1347
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:44.707
- Watch your mouth.
- What? You really are crazy.

1348
01:26:44.708 --> 01:26:45.833
Enough!

1349
01:26:46.875 --> 01:26:47.749
Enough.

1350
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:49.666
We're not telling her today.

1351
01:26:50.916 --> 01:26:51.750
Let's leave.

1352
01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:53.625
What?

1353
01:26:55.333 --> 01:26:56.208
What's wrong?

1354
01:26:57.083 --> 01:26:58.582
- Where...
- Hide this.

1355
01:26:58.583 --> 01:26:59.833
are you going?

1356
01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:01.832
You don't want to have a drink first?

1357
01:27:01.833 --> 01:27:04.707
- We need to leave, Sis.
- Yes.

1358
01:27:04.708 --> 01:27:06.083
Come on.

1359
01:27:07.958 --> 01:27:09.582
- Yati.
- Yes.

1360
01:27:09.583 --> 01:27:11.457
You forgot to feed the goats?

1361
01:27:11.458 --> 01:27:13.666
It's your fault.

1362
01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:16.958
Put it away. Mom, I'm going out.

1363
01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:25.707
- Do you want me to hold it for you?
- No, I'm fine.

1364
01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:27.791
Okay, I'll be upstairs.

1365
01:27:52.416 --> 01:27:57.833
Let's welcome the Head Producer of
Dailywave Records and Midnight Serenade!

1366
01:28:00.458 --> 01:28:01.790
Hello, everybody.

1367
01:28:01.791 --> 01:28:03.207
Hey!

1368
01:28:03.208 --> 01:28:04.375
Awesome!

1369
01:28:09.166 --> 01:28:11.666
Why does the cover
have Uncle Satya's picture?

1370
01:28:12.250 --> 01:28:14.207
Why didn't they tell us
the title of our EP?

1371
01:28:14.208 --> 01:28:16.249
Okay, Q&A time.

1372
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:18.374
Can you tell us the background...

1373
01:28:18.375 --> 01:28:21.374
for choosing that artwork
as your cover album?

1374
01:28:21.375 --> 01:28:24.082
And why did you use
Captain Satya's picture?

1375
01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:28.790
People said the tragedy of Captain Satya's
story was a blessing in disguise...

1376
01:28:28.791 --> 01:28:30.457
for the rising popularity
of Midnight Serenade.

1377
01:28:30.458 --> 01:28:33.415
How does Mr. Ian feel about that?

1378
01:28:33.416 --> 01:28:34.624
One more question.

1379
01:28:34.625 --> 01:28:35.665
Me!

1380
01:28:35.666 --> 01:28:39.749
Mr. Ian, do you think your band
would still be relevant...

1381
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:41.915
without selling your sad stories?

1382
01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:44.624
- Maybe Mr. Beni can answer that.
- Okay.

1383
01:28:44.625 --> 01:28:49.415
You'll find songs from
Midnight Serenade's new EP...

1384
01:28:49.416 --> 01:28:54.874
that will be performed
for the first time in this Resonate Fest.

1385
01:28:54.875 --> 01:28:58.790
The songs are guaranteed to give you
more goosebumps than <i>Ocean</i>.

1386
01:28:58.791 --> 01:29:00.832
Can you even ask real questions?

1387
01:29:00.833 --> 01:29:02.499
Maybe about our plan, or our creativity?

1388
01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.332
Me!

1389
01:29:04.333 --> 01:29:06.290
Order, please!

1390
01:29:06.291 --> 01:29:08.207
<i>Order, everybody.</i>

1391
01:29:08.208 --> 01:29:11.999
Calm down.

1392
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.625
Order!

1393
01:29:15.541 --> 01:29:17.207
<i>Order!</i>

1394
01:29:17.208 --> 01:29:19.624
Please, be quiet.

1395
01:29:19.625 --> 01:29:22.415
If there was no viral news
about your sad stories...

1396
01:29:22.416 --> 01:29:24.665
"My dad this and that".

1397
01:29:24.666 --> 01:29:27.540
Do you think Dailywaves is going to extend
the contract with Midnight Serenade?

1398
01:29:27.541 --> 01:29:29.957
Or do you need more sad stories?

1399
01:29:29.958 --> 01:29:32.416
Do you need more victims?

1400
01:29:33.666 --> 01:29:35.624
Watch your mouth!

1401
01:29:35.625 --> 01:29:40.166
- Ian.
- Sir!

1402
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.124
- Ian.
- Ian.

1403
01:29:43.125 --> 01:29:45.415
- Hey! Listen!
- Ian.

1404
01:29:45.416 --> 01:29:47.540
Are you trying to breach your contract?

1405
01:29:47.541 --> 01:29:50.040
- Ian...
- Think about it carefully.

1406
01:29:50.041 --> 01:29:51.208
You're not the only band we have.

1407
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:54.832
Son of a bitch.

1408
01:29:54.833 --> 01:29:55.875
So?

1409
01:29:56.875 --> 01:29:58.707
You're a piece of shit!

1410
01:29:58.708 --> 01:29:59.916
Ian.

1411
01:30:01.833 --> 01:30:02.833
Give me the contract.

1412
01:30:03.416 --> 01:30:08.041
Where did I authorize in the contract with
the record company to use my dad's name?

1413
01:30:13.625 --> 01:30:14.625
None.

1414
01:30:18.291 --> 01:30:19.333
And you too.

1415
01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:21.749
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1416
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:24.665
You're just their puppet.

1417
01:30:24.666 --> 01:30:27.249
They take advantage of
what happened to my father...

1418
01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:28.208
Ian.

1419
01:30:28.791 --> 01:30:30.707
...and you know that.

1420
01:30:30.708 --> 01:30:31.874
I quit.

1421
01:30:31.875 --> 01:30:33.124
- Ian.
- Ian!

1422
01:30:33.125 --> 01:30:34.290
- I'm leaving the band.
- Ian.

1423
01:30:34.291 --> 01:30:35.833
Hey!

1424
01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:37.790
- Let him leave.
- Leave!

1425
01:30:37.791 --> 01:30:38.791
Everybody, leave!

1426
01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:03.833
What are you doing here?

1427
01:31:04.416 --> 01:31:05.415
Who's with Mom at home?

1428
01:31:05.416 --> 01:31:06.875
Why didn't you tell me?

1429
01:31:07.541 --> 01:31:08.624
Hey!

1430
01:31:08.625 --> 01:31:11.165
What happened?

1431
01:31:11.166 --> 01:31:12.499
Get up.

1432
01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:15.457
Let go.

1433
01:31:15.458 --> 01:31:18.874
Calm down, Sir.

1434
01:31:18.875 --> 01:31:19.791
Come on, let's go.

1435
01:31:20.458 --> 01:31:21.500
What are you doing?

1436
01:31:22.083 --> 01:31:23.416
Do you want to fight?

1437
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.207
What are you doing here?
What did you tell Mom?

1438
01:31:26.208 --> 01:31:29.874
The question is
why did you use Dad's picture...

1439
01:31:29.875 --> 01:31:33.125
for Midnight Serenade's new album? Why?

1440
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:36.832
Listen to me.

1441
01:31:36.833 --> 01:31:39.166
Since when don't I listen to you, asshole!

1442
01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:46.708
Since we were kids,
I've always listened to you.

1443
01:31:48.166 --> 01:31:50.249
To this day, I'm still listening to you,
but I've never felt...

1444
01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:52.291
heard by my own brother.

1445
01:31:54.583 --> 01:31:56.083
Have you ever listened to me?

1446
01:31:59.375 --> 01:32:01.291
You're so selfish, you know?

1447
01:32:02.958 --> 01:32:05.832
When Mom finds out about this,
what are you going to do?

1448
01:32:05.833 --> 01:32:09.541
I agreed when you decided to lie to Mom.
Whatever your decisions, I always agreed.

1449
01:32:13.375 --> 01:32:16.666
Dad is gone, Ian. He's dead now.

1450
01:32:17.666 --> 01:32:20.333
If anything happened to Mom,
we'd only have each other.

1451
01:32:34.833 --> 01:32:36.625
I quit the band, Ta.

1452
01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:26.875
I want to apologize to you, Ta.

1453
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.125
I thought...

1454
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:32.250
I had to do better than you,

1455
01:33:33.291 --> 01:33:35.958
to make Mom and Dad proud of me.

1456
01:33:38.333 --> 01:33:39.958
Since the day you were born...

1457
01:33:41.166 --> 01:33:42.875
Dad has been teaching me...

1458
01:33:44.708 --> 01:33:46.541
to be tough.

1459
01:33:47.208 --> 01:33:49.916
He said I have to be an independent boy.

1460
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.083
Now I have to be a role model...

1461
01:33:55.416 --> 01:33:56.458
for you.

1462
01:34:01.583 --> 01:34:03.375
But apparently it's the other way around.

1463
01:34:09.708 --> 01:34:11.750
I just want to be like you, Ta.

1464
01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:14.458
I want to be seen.

1465
01:34:14.958 --> 01:34:16.916
Mom is so proud of you.

1466
01:34:20.125 --> 01:34:21.708
And especially Dad.

1467
01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:25.875
I was scared.

1468
01:34:26.916 --> 01:34:29.000
I felt like I'm...

1469
01:34:29.958 --> 01:34:31.458
not important.

1470
01:34:32.916 --> 01:34:34.333
But you are.

1471
01:34:37.166 --> 01:34:39.249
You were always important.

1472
01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:41.083
To me...

1473
01:34:41.916 --> 01:34:43.291
to Dad...

1474
01:34:44.291 --> 01:34:45.791
to Mom.

1475
01:34:46.666 --> 01:34:48.541
I want to apologize to you too...

1476
01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:51.333
if I can't become...

1477
01:34:52.708 --> 01:34:55.750
a brother you wished for.

1478
01:34:57.916 --> 01:35:01.625
I miss our closeness.

1479
01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:08.500
I miss the time
when I could tell my brother everything.

1480
01:35:10.833 --> 01:35:12.500
But now there's a distance between us.

1481
01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:17.208
You choose to live in your own world...

1482
01:35:17.791 --> 01:35:20.707
and you forget the people you left.

1483
01:35:20.708 --> 01:35:23.708
You left me, Mom...

1484
01:35:25.666 --> 01:35:27.166
and Dad.

1485
01:35:29.916 --> 01:35:33.166
<i>You know he tried
so hard to be your friend.</i>

1486
01:35:36.541 --> 01:35:40.791
<i>He even gave all of his favorite stuff...</i>

1487
01:35:42.666 --> 01:35:44.083
<i>to you.</i>

1488
01:35:44.875 --> 01:35:46.999
<i>His guitar...</i>

1489
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.416
<i>even his favorite video camera,
he gave it to you too.</i>

1490
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.916
<i>Why don't you open the files
on his flashdisk...</i>

1491
01:35:58.541 --> 01:36:01.125
<i>all the contents...</i>

1492
01:36:01.708 --> 01:36:03.250
<i>are talking about his concerns for you.</i>

1493
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.708
<i>You never cared.</i>

1494
01:36:08.458 --> 01:36:10.125
I just want to let you know...

1495
01:36:12.375 --> 01:36:15.250
that I'm always proud
to have you as my brother.

1496
01:36:19.708 --> 01:36:20.791
Always.

1497
01:36:25.333 --> 01:36:26.791
<i>- Let's go.
- Okay.</i>

1498
01:36:28.875 --> 01:36:31.000
<i>Peddle hard.</i>

1499
01:36:32.458 --> 01:36:33.999
<i>Vroom vroom.</i>

1500
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.625
<i>It hurts!</i>

1501
01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:37.415
<i>Daddy...</i>

1502
01:36:37.416 --> 01:36:38.458
Ouch!

1503
01:36:40.708 --> 01:36:41.915
<i>- Are you all right?
- Yeah.</i>

1504
01:36:41.916 --> 01:36:46.040
<i>February 16th, 2005.</i>

1505
01:36:46.041 --> 01:36:50.207
<i>Ian just learned to ride a bike, right?</i>

1506
01:36:50.208 --> 01:36:51.499
<i>- Yeah.
- Did you fall?</i>

1507
01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:52.583
<i>I did, I fell.</i>

1508
01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:54.790
<i>Why are you not crying?</i>

1509
01:36:54.791 --> 01:36:56.916
<i>You said I shouldn't cry.</i>

1510
01:36:57.916 --> 01:37:00.165
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

1511
01:37:00.166 --> 01:37:02.916
<i>I mean you have to be true
to your own feelings.</i>

1512
01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:07.000
<i>If you want to cry, you can cry.</i>

1513
01:37:07.625 --> 01:37:10.166
<i>Boys can cry too.</i>

1514
01:37:13.458 --> 01:37:14.416
<i>Uta.</i>

1515
01:37:15.250 --> 01:37:16.540
<i>- Let's shower.
- Okay.</i>

1516
01:37:16.541 --> 01:37:18.624
<i>Do you want to shower?
I'm gonna spray you with water.</i>

1517
01:37:18.625 --> 01:37:20.124
<i>Okay?</i>

1518
01:37:20.125 --> 01:37:21.250
<i>Two. Three.</i>

1519
01:37:22.541 --> 01:37:24.790
<i>- Yay!
- Happy Birthday, Ian!</i>

1520
01:37:24.791 --> 01:37:27.791
<i>Hey, don't splash me with water!</i>

1521
01:37:29.083 --> 01:37:30.833
<i>There, look.</i>

1522
01:37:32.083 --> 01:37:33.249
<i>This is Dad's room.</i>

1523
01:37:33.250 --> 01:37:36.124
<i>December 27th, 2005.</i>

1524
01:37:36.125 --> 01:37:39.540
<i>Thank God the simulation
of tsunami countermeasures...</i>

1525
01:37:39.541 --> 01:37:41.583
<i>went very well.</i>

1526
01:37:42.375 --> 01:37:46.416
<i>But during the simulation, I couldn't...</i>

1527
01:37:47.708 --> 01:37:49.625
<i>I couldn't concentrate because...</i>

1528
01:37:50.916 --> 01:37:52.958
<i>because I kept thinking about Ian...</i>

1529
01:37:54.333 --> 01:37:57.625
<i>who has to be admitted to the hospital
due to dengue fever he got.</i>

1530
01:37:58.750 --> 01:38:01.415
<i>Every time I called him...</i>

1531
01:38:01.416 --> 01:38:04.624
<i>I always tried to joke around...</i>

1532
01:38:04.625 --> 01:38:09.666
<i>but inside I was worried
because I should've been there with him.</i>

1533
01:38:10.958 --> 01:38:12.375
<i>Get well soon, my boy.</i>

1534
01:38:13.625 --> 01:38:16.791
<i>I train new crew all the time.</i>

1535
01:38:18.166 --> 01:38:20.457
<i>But while doing that...</i>

1536
01:38:20.458 --> 01:38:22.541
<i>I can't help but thinking...</i>

1537
01:38:23.250 --> 01:38:26.583
<i>that I rarely taught my sons
anything back home.</i>

1538
01:38:27.625 --> 01:38:30.957
<i>One day I come home,
and suddenly Ian and Uta...</i>

1539
01:38:30.958 --> 01:38:34.208
<i>already learned to do stuff.</i>

1540
01:38:35.333 --> 01:38:39.541
<i>I hope someday,
Ian and Uta will understand.</i>

1541
01:38:43.541 --> 01:38:44.708
<i>Last night...</i>

1542
01:38:45.291 --> 01:38:47.250
<i>we were hit by a big storm.</i>

1543
01:38:48.291 --> 01:38:50.957
<i>This was the first time I felt...</i>

1544
01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:52.375
<i>so scared.</i>

1545
01:38:55.125 --> 01:38:57.583
<i>I was scared of not being able
to see your mother again.</i>

1546
01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.166
<i>Or Ian.</i>

1547
01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.541
<i>Or Uta too.</i>

1548
01:39:06.208 --> 01:39:07.500
<i>The people I love.</i>

1549
01:39:09.166 --> 01:39:10.999
<i>But then again...</i>

1550
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.416
<i>it's the risk
that comes with my profession.</i>

1551
01:39:16.375 --> 01:39:17.707
<i>I know if...</i>

1552
01:39:17.708 --> 01:39:20.874
<i>if one day anything happened to me,</i>

1553
01:39:20.875 --> 01:39:23.499
<i>Ian and Uta...</i>

1554
01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:26.041
<i>you can take care of your mom.</i>

1555
01:39:30.208 --> 01:39:32.083
<i>When I come home...</i>

1556
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:35.457
<i>I want to leave this video camera at home.</i>

1557
01:39:35.458 --> 01:39:38.124
<i>I want both of you
to record your activities</i>

1558
01:39:38.125 --> 01:39:40.875
<i>so I won't miss the precious moments.</i>

1559
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.082
<i>Honey, Ian!</i>

1560
01:40:16.083 --> 01:40:17.665
<i>Uta, look here!</i>

1561
01:40:17.666 --> 01:40:19.415
<i>Bye!</i>

1562
01:40:19.416 --> 01:40:21.125
<i>Bye-bye!</i>

1563
01:40:23.625 --> 01:40:25.125
<i>Come here!</i>

1564
01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:28.875
<i>I love you.</i>

1565
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:34.000
<i>I love you.</i>

1566

D-DAY ANNIVERSARY

1567
01:41:12.708 --> 01:41:13.999
Mom?

1568
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.416
What do you want for breakfast?

1569
01:41:17.708 --> 01:41:18.791
Mom?

1570
01:41:23.291 --> 01:41:24.291
Mom?

1571
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.083
Ian!

1572
01:41:31.375 --> 01:41:32.708
What is it, Ta?

1573
01:41:33.208 --> 01:41:34.750
Mom's gone.

1574
01:41:35.375 --> 01:41:36.708
Have you checked outside?

1575
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.291
Not yet.

1576
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:44.915
Mom?

1577
01:41:44.916 --> 01:41:47.291
- She's not there either.
- Check again upstairs.

1578
01:41:57.333 --> 01:41:58.375
Ian?

1579
01:41:59.541 --> 01:42:00.750
Ian!

1580
01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:04.041
Hey.

1581
01:42:05.416 --> 01:42:06.790
The box is gone.

1582
01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:08.458
Dad's box is gone.

1583
01:42:13.166 --> 01:42:14.208
Mom?

1584
01:42:14.958 --> 01:42:16.874
- Mom?
- Mom!

1585
01:42:16.875 --> 01:42:19.582
Sir, have you seen Mrs. Dini?

1586
01:42:19.583 --> 01:42:23.040
Mrs, Enin, excuse me.
Have you seen my mother?

1587
01:42:23.041 --> 01:42:24.457
Din!

1588
01:42:24.458 --> 01:42:26.375
- Mom?
- Dinda!

1589
01:42:26.875 --> 01:42:27.875
Well?

1590
01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:31.624
Dinda.

1591
01:42:31.625 --> 01:42:33.375
- Din, hello?
- Din, is Mom with you?

1592
01:42:35.458 --> 01:42:36.541
<i>Hello.</i>

1593
01:42:45.625 --> 01:42:47.208
Where are you, Mom?

1594
01:42:47.958 --> 01:42:49.416
Mom, I'm coming to get you.

1595
01:42:51.291 --> 01:42:53.166
I want to talk to your father.

1596
01:42:54.166 --> 01:42:55.416
Can I?

1597
01:42:56.541 --> 01:42:57.500
<i>Honey.</i>

1598
01:43:02.208 --> 01:43:04.541
<i>Rest in peace in heaven.</i>

1599
01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:07.874
Me...

1600
01:43:07.875 --> 01:43:09.541
Ian and Uta...

1601
01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.291
we're going to be okay.

1602
01:43:15.666 --> 01:43:18.041
<i>Rest in peace, Honey.</i>

1603
01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:22.125
<i>The three of us are gonna be okay.</i>

1604
01:43:22.708 --> 01:43:24.083
Where are you, Mom?

1605
01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:32.583
She hung up.

1606
01:43:33.708 --> 01:43:34.749
Ta.

1607
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:36.582
- Shit.
- Where is she?

1608
01:43:36.583 --> 01:43:38.499
- Where are you going?
- Shit.

1609
01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.874
Dinda.

That's the address.

1612
01:43:42.916 --> 01:43:44.541
Let's go.

1613
01:43:54.041 --> 01:43:56.332
<i>Or you need more sad stories?</i>

1614
01:43:56.333 --> 01:43:58.666
<i>You need more victims?</i>

1615
01:43:59.750 --> 01:44:01.499
<i>Watch your mouth!</i>

1616
01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.583
<i>Sir!</i>

1617
01:44:04.583 --> 01:44:05.625
Son of a bitch.

1618
01:44:09.416 --> 01:44:11.082
- Mom.
- Uta.

1619
01:44:11.083 --> 01:44:13.666
Sorry, I have to do
something urgent. Hang on.

1620
01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:30.458
Mom?

1621
01:44:33.333 --> 01:44:34.375
It's locked.

1622
01:44:35.041 --> 01:44:36.541
I think she's sleeping.

1623

I have the same right as you do!

1630
01:47:43.291 --> 01:47:46.041
I should have been told
about your father's condition.

1631
01:47:46.625 --> 01:47:48.708
No matter how bad it was.

1632
01:47:51.958 --> 01:47:53.625
Why did you lie to me?

1633
01:47:56.291 --> 01:47:58.291
Why did you lie to me?

1634
01:48:00.416 --> 01:48:01.625
Answer me!

1635
01:48:04.041 --> 01:48:05.416
I was afraid, Mom.

1636
01:48:06.833 --> 01:48:08.166
Me too.

1637
01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:10.875
Afraid of what?

1638
01:48:12.375 --> 01:48:14.791
I was afraid of losing you too.

1639
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.250
I promise...

1640
01:48:25.125 --> 01:48:27.208
I will never leave either of you.

1641
01:48:28.958 --> 01:48:30.458
But do you know...

1642
01:48:31.541 --> 01:48:33.915
your father proposed to me right here.

1643
01:48:33.916 --> 01:48:36.499
And we made a vow.

1644
01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:39.291
We promised to never lie to each other!

1645
01:48:40.583 --> 01:48:43.500
And we taught that to both of you!

1646
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.790
And by you lying to me...

1647
01:48:46.791 --> 01:48:50.458
it robbed me of my right
to pray for his soul!

1648
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:54.750
He needs me to pray for his soul.

1649
01:48:58.125 --> 01:49:00.457
Your poor dad.

1650
01:49:00.458 --> 01:49:02.666
I feel sorry for him.

1651
01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:07.000
Don't you feel sorry for him, Uta?

1652
01:49:11.916 --> 01:49:14.332
Don't you feel sorry for him, Uta?

1653
01:49:14.333 --> 01:49:16.875
Your poor dad.

1654
01:49:18.291 --> 01:49:21.541
I know he wanted me
to pray for his soul too.

1655
01:49:25.291 --> 01:49:27.791
Your poor dad.

1656
01:49:34.125 --> 01:49:35.625
Forgive us, Mom.

1657
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.041
Ian.

1658
01:49:54.583 --> 01:49:55.708
It's okay.

1659
01:50:08.166 --> 01:50:09.666
I'm so sorry, Mom.

1660
01:50:14.625 --> 01:50:16.083
Please forgive me.

1661
01:50:19.916 --> 01:50:22.083
I don't want to lose you either.

1662
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:44.499
<i>Littoral Zone</i>

1663
01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:47.083
<i>It's where the sea meets the land.</i>

1664
01:50:47.916 --> 01:50:50.290
<i>This is where everything looks clearer.</i>

1665
01:50:50.291 --> 01:50:52.791
<i>That life is all about balance.</i>

1666
01:50:53.666 --> 01:50:56.249
<i>I can't keep blaming the past.</i>

1667
01:50:56.250 --> 01:50:58.083
<i>All I have to do is to make peace with it.</i>

1668
01:50:58.750 --> 01:51:02.250
<i>Either with the loss, or with myself.</i>

1669
01:51:03.208 --> 01:51:05.957
<i>Making peace is a part of the journey.</i>

1670
01:51:05.958 --> 01:51:09.082
<i>And it's time for me to celebrate...</i>

1671
01:51:09.083 --> 01:51:11.208
<i>what's left from it.</i>

1672
01:51:19.958 --> 01:51:20.833
Why did you erase it?

1673
01:51:21.625 --> 01:51:23.666
You don't want to use it for your podcast?

1674
01:51:25.833 --> 01:51:27.207
The voice changer app?

1675
01:51:27.208 --> 01:51:28.916
I saw it on the monitor.

1676
01:51:30.291 --> 01:51:31.750
Well...

1677
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:33.999
How do I explain it... I feel like...

1678
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:39.375
it's unfair to do a podcast
with an altered voice.

1679
01:51:41.250 --> 01:51:43.541
How about your Midnight Serenade?

1680
01:51:47.541 --> 01:51:50.707
We decided to end the contract
with the label and Resonate, Ian.

1681
01:51:50.708 --> 01:51:54.291
They agreed to let us go without penalty.

1682
01:51:54.958 --> 01:51:57.124
What about your brother's college?

1683
01:51:57.125 --> 01:51:59.499
Thank God, he got a scholarship.

1684
01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:01.915
My grandma's spell worked.

1685
01:52:01.916 --> 01:52:04.582
Your grandma again.

1686
01:52:04.583 --> 01:52:06.707
That cow dung?

1687
01:52:06.708 --> 01:52:09.790
I can still play in the band
and also collect cow dung.

1688
01:52:09.791 --> 01:52:10.708
I see.

1689
01:52:11.958 --> 01:52:13.415
And when are you getting married?

1690
01:52:13.416 --> 01:52:14.874
With the money
from streaming our performance.

1691
01:52:14.875 --> 01:52:16.332
I can get married.

1692
01:52:16.333 --> 01:52:17.958
Major label, Boss.

1693
01:52:20.041 --> 01:52:21.166
You look so happy.

1694
01:52:21.833 --> 01:52:24.416
I want to apologize to you all for...

1695
01:52:26.541 --> 01:52:27.708
ruining everything.

1696
01:52:28.833 --> 01:52:29.707
There you go!

1697
01:52:29.708 --> 01:52:30.625
I LOVE BOILED NUGGET

1698
01:52:33.833 --> 01:52:37.125
The song that rescued the band!

1699
01:52:37.708 --> 01:52:38.999
Yesterday Leon said...

1700
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.790
there's a producer who's interested
in producing this song.

1701
01:52:41.791 --> 01:52:45.750
Who's the moron
who wants to record the song?

1702
01:52:46.625 --> 01:52:47.541
Ian.

1703
01:52:49.666 --> 01:52:50.832
We...

1704
01:52:50.833 --> 01:52:53.416
our door is always open
if you decide to come back.

1705
01:52:55.458 --> 01:52:57.416
My family needs me now.

1706
01:52:59.750 --> 01:53:00.833
And likewise.

1707
01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:03.874
I'm gonna boil you!

1708
01:53:03.875 --> 01:53:05.249
You want to turn me into a nugget?

1709
01:53:05.250 --> 01:53:06.790
Ian Antono.

1710
01:53:06.791 --> 01:53:08.375
All the best.

1711
01:53:09.958 --> 01:53:11.083
Tomorrow, okay?

1712
01:53:12.083 --> 01:53:13.000
Let's finish it tomorrow.

1713
01:53:13.666 --> 01:53:15.166
The last assignment from Dad.

1714
01:54:28.291 --> 01:54:30.125
<i>Come on!</i>

1715
01:54:37.166 --> 01:54:38.582
<i>Come here.</i>

1716
01:54:38.583 --> 01:54:39.750
<i>Climb up.</i>

1717
01:54:41.666 --> 01:54:43.374
<i>There, you see that?</i>

1718
01:54:43.375 --> 01:54:44.665
<i>Do you want to see it or not?</i>

1719
01:54:44.666 --> 01:54:46.082
<i>This is Daddy's control room.</i>

1720
01:54:46.083 --> 01:54:48.207
<i>It's here. Come here!</i>

1721
01:54:48.208 --> 01:54:49.957
<i>Now, look.</i>

1722
01:54:49.958 --> 01:54:51.290
<i>Now you try. Hello?</i>

1723
01:54:51.291 --> 01:54:53.499
<i>Hello, Mom?</i>

1724
01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:56.082
<i>- Call Mom.
- Mommy.</i>

1725
01:54:56.083 --> 01:54:58.041
<i>It looks like one!</i>

1726
01:54:59.458 --> 01:55:01.749
<i>Where? Oh, I see.</i>

1727
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:02.665
<i>I want it!</i>

1728
01:55:02.666 --> 01:55:04.916
<i>Okay, let's go. We're gonna buy ice cream!</i>

1729
01:55:40.625 --> 01:55:42.416
What do you think
he's doing up there, Mom?

1730
01:55:47.625 --> 01:55:48.708
I've finished...

1731
01:55:49.875 --> 01:55:51.583
my thesis.

1732
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.208
Soon, I'll get my Bachelors Degree.

1733
01:56:02.791 --> 01:56:06.124
But in my graduation picture,
there won't be...

1734
01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:07.750
there won't be you in it.

1735
01:56:18.375 --> 01:56:21.541
I hope you can still watch
my graduation from heaven.

1736
01:56:24.041 --> 01:56:25.166
Thank you for...

1737
01:56:27.083 --> 01:56:28.958
everything that you...

1738
01:56:29.958 --> 01:56:32.000
taught me.

1739
01:56:34.333 --> 01:56:35.875
I love you so much.

1740
01:56:37.583 --> 01:56:38.875
So so much.

1741
01:56:42.208 --> 01:56:44.541
I've stopped searching for the stage, Dad.

1742
01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.458
I found the stage I need, Dad.

1743
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:55.000
Thank you, Dad.

1744
01:57:05.541 --> 01:57:06.583
Honey.

1745
01:57:09.416 --> 01:57:11.500
The children and I miss you very much.

1746
01:57:14.541 --> 01:57:16.999
The house oddly feels...

1747
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.208
so quiet without you.

1748
01:57:27.125 --> 01:57:28.083
Honey.

1749
01:57:29.166 --> 01:57:32.375
You can see that the boys
are getting along again.

1750
01:57:33.708 --> 01:57:35.416
I know that's what you wanted.

1751
01:57:35.916 --> 01:57:37.875
Now they can...

1752
01:57:39.291 --> 01:57:41.083
take good care of me.

1753
01:57:42.291 --> 01:57:44.749
You don't have to worry anymore.

1754
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:46.875
You can rest in peace now.

1755
01:57:47.916 --> 01:57:49.541
Wait for me, okay?

1756
01:57:52.916 --> 01:57:54.915
Don't get tired...

1757
01:57:54.916 --> 01:57:57.333
don't get tired of waiting for me.

1758
01:57:58.458 --> 01:58:00.166
Promise me, okay?

1759
01:58:06.541 --> 01:58:09.250
You are welcome to enter my dreams.

1760
01:58:11.791 --> 01:58:14.375
I'm bringing you your gift.

1761
01:58:15.041 --> 01:58:16.957
It's for our anniversary.

1762
01:58:16.958 --> 01:58:19.000
I'm gonna keep it for you.

1763
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:25.708
Mom.

1764
01:58:29.250 --> 01:58:31.166
Before he left on his last voyage...

1765
01:58:31.958 --> 01:58:34.290
he asked us...

1766
01:58:34.291 --> 01:58:37.583
to finish the song he wrote for you.

1767
01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:42.958
You have to listen to the song.

1768
01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:15.041
We did it, Dad!

1769
02:00:15.416 --> 02:00:20.874
