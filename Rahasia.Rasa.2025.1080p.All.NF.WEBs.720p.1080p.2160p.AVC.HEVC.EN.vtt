1
00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:47.208
Give me some salt.

2
00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:52.416
- Afternoon, Chef!
- Afternoon, Chef!

3
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:57.125
You.

4
00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:58.250
Yes, Chef?

5
00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.458
- How many fingers is this?
- Two, Chef.

6
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:00.416
- Two, right?
- Yes, two.

7
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.541
So, you're not fucking blind!

8
00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:02.958
Then, what the hell is this?

9
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:04.375
Clean this shit thoroughly!

10
00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:05.333
And this one too!

11
00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:06.291
Yes, Chef.

12
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Change this one.

13
00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:11.291
This one.

14
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:13.958
What the hell is this?

15
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:15.666
- Sorry, Chef!
- Can't you do it right?

16
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.291
- Yes, Chef!
- Throw this one out!

17
00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:18.625
Make it from scratch!

18
00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:20.125
- And clean it beforehand!
- Yes, Chef.

19
00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:23.541
Let me try.

20
00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:35.125
- Add this.
- Yes, Chef.

21
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:37.916
Hurry up!

22
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The guests are waiting!

23
00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:40.666
- Come on, hurry up!
- Yes, Chef!

24
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.458
Is this the best you can
do as the top graduates?

25
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:43.750
Come on, hurry up!

26
00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:53.125
Uci. From Miss Dinda.

27
00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:54.833
- Okay, Chef.
- Okay.

28
00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.750
SHRIMP PASTE - GRADE A

29
00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:13.083
Bring me the sauce, Chef!

30
00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:19.125
Here it is, Chef.

31
00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.916
What the hell is that?

32
00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:27.291
Local fusion sauce
that Miss Dinda requested, Chef.

33
00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:28.791
- Using shrimp paste.
- Shrimp paste?

34
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:29.708
You idiot!

35
00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:32.166
I prepared it for months
and you put shrimp paste on?

36
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.333
What the hell are you thinking?

37
00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:35.583
Only perfection comes from this kitchen.

38
00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:36.541
Don't you understand?

39
00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:38.750
- Sorry, Chef!
- This is not her fault, Chef.

40
00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:40.041
Do not interfere!

41
00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:42.125
Dinda asked for an additional sauce

42
00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:44.208
for the guests who prefer local dishes.

43
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:47.541
Try it, then.

44
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:48.958
Try it!

45
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.166
Does it taste good?

46
00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:56.208
Spit it out!

47
00:03:57.875 --> 00:03:59.250
You're my Sous-chef,

48
00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:00.166
got it?

49
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.333
Don't be a smartass
and interfere with my business.

50
00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:06.791
Chef.

51
00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:07.875
Now, I'd like to ask you.

52
00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.916
Who's your head chef? Me or Dinda?

53
00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:12.500
- Chef Ressa.
- Who?

54
00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:14.375
- Chef Ressa.
- Now you know!

55
00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:15.458
Take off your apron!

56
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:16.875
Now!

57
00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:22.083
Put it down!

58
00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:25.791
Leave my kitchen!

59
00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:27.833
Now! And don't you dare to come back!

60
00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:30.083
- Yes, Chef.
- What a smarty-pants!

61
00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:33.083
All-hands come here!

62
00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:34.041
Quickly!

63
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:40.958
Everybody listen!

64
00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:43.291
For one last time,

65
00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:45.541
Maharasa only gives the guests

66
00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:47.625
véra Cucina Italiana,
the real Italian taste.

67
00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:49.416
- Understand?
- Yes, Chef!

68
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.541
Pasta is our speciality.

69
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:54.500
There's no shrimp paste,
coriander, or anything like that!

70
00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:55.458
Tell them to go to a
<i>Wartega</i> roadside stall

71
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:56.666
if they want to eat something local.

72
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.458
- Understand?
- Yes, Chef.

73
00:04:58.541 --> 00:04:59.458
Freaking idiots!

74
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.833
Take five! Go away!

75
00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:39.333
Ossobuco from Maharasa.

76
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.375
Wow.

77
00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:52.625
Okay.

78
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.125
Very delicious!

79
00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:03.791
Amazing!

80
00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:05.625
Hey.

81
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.291
We're at a party.

82
00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:10.416
Okay then, everybody hungry?

83
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.625
Let's eat now!

84
00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:32.125
Magnificent.

85
00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:35.166
Amazing food

86
00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:37.500
and extraordinary performance.

87
00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:40.708
You are truly...

88
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:42.500
a genius!

89
00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:43.500
Thank you, Sir.

90
00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:47.250
How can you make that pasta

91
00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:48.916
so satisfying and flavourful?

92
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We import the spices from Gragnano, Sir.

93
00:06:54.083 --> 00:06:56.500
The city where my Papa was born.

94
00:06:57.666 --> 00:06:59.208
A city that is crazy about pasta.

95
00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:00.333
That's right.

96
00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:02.375
Hi, Dad.

97
00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:03.458
Sorry, I'm late.
The shooting went longer than we expected.

98
00:07:03.541 --> 00:07:04.833
- Hi.
- Hi.

99
00:07:04.916 --> 00:07:06.416
My love!

100
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.958
You're late.

101
00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:10.375
You didn't witness

102
00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:13.208
your boyfriend's magnificent performance.

103
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:15.166
He must've been amazing, right?

104
00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:18.416
Then, you agree to invest
in his restaurant in Italy?

105
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.791
Alright.

106
00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:25.083
- Come to my house tomorrow.
- Yes, Sir.

107
00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:27.416
I will be waiting for you at my house.

108
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.625
Okay, Sir.

109
00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:30.125
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye-bye, Darling.

110
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.625
One more step and my dream will come true.

111
00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:42.916
You're amazing.

112
00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:45.208
Because you're always here with me.

113
00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:47.208
Have you eaten?

114
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:48.125
Not yet. I'm famished.

115
00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:50.208
Okay, sit down. I'll bring you some food.

116

PANGAN NUSANTARA PERKASA GROUP
COMMERCIAL INVOICE

117
00:08:13.583 --> 00:08:15.041
GINGER, CLOVE, ANDALIMAN, CORIANDER.

118
00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:16.250
Excuse me, Sir.

119
00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:18.791
Mr. Ressa is already here.

120
00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:19.916
So,

121
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.166
I need to sign this
document tonight, right?

122
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.291
Yes, Sir.

123
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.041
This is for

124
00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:37.416
100 containers that will
be shipped to the USA, right?

125
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.625
Yes, Sir.

126
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.125
Okay.

127
00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:42.291
Excuse me, Sir.

128
00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:43.416
Please come in, Mr. Ressa.

129
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.458
Mr. Broto.

130
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.416
Are all these authentic?

131
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.541
All of these?

132
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.208
Of course they are!

133
00:08:56.125 --> 00:08:58.958
Are you doubting me?

134
00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:01.416
That is...

135
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.958
a photo of Dinda's brothers, right?

136
00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:07.083
At first...

137
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.750
I thought I would only have two sons...

138
00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:17.583
even though I wanted a daughter.

139
00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:22.375
But when I was 50 years old...

140
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.791
God finally answered my prayers.

141
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.291
Dinda was born.

142
00:09:30.833 --> 00:09:31.958
So...

143
00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:35.166
I would like to ask you.

144
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.291
Are you truly...

145
00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:40.250
in love with...

146
00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:41.958
my youngest child?

147
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:43.750
Truly, Sir.

148
00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:46.416
Then,

149
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:49.416
All of this...

150
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.541
is worth billions.

151
00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:57.291
And I will give it...

152
00:09:57.375 --> 00:09:59.791
to Dinda.

153
00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:04.291
Including this one.

154
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:06.083
Have a seat.

155
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.458
I will give this to Dinda.

156
00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:15.541
You have to learn it thoroughly.

157
00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:17.500
Mustika Rasa - The Taste of Flavour.

158
00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:20.875
Mustika Rasa is full of...

159
00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:25.458
Indonesian authentic food recipes.

160
00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:28.458
The legacy of Soekarno.

161
00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:37.916
There are 1000 recipes in here.

162
00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:42.416
There are 945
more, but it's still a mystery.

163
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.541
1000?

164
00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:46.500
Yes.

165
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.958
And you need to know, Ressa.

166
00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:53.875
Indonesia is very
rich in natural resources.

167
00:10:57.666 --> 00:10:59.875
<i>One of them is culinary.</i>

168
00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:02.500
<i>Culinary is like...</i>

169
00:11:03.083 --> 00:11:05.708
<i>the art of persuasion through the tongue.</i>

170
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.250
<i>That's why the founding fathers...</i>

171
00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:14.625
<i>thought that we could use culinary...</i>

172
00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:16.333
<i>as our political tool.</i>

173
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.291
<i>Gastronomy diplomacy.</i>

174
00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:26.333
<i>Diplomacy through the stomach.</i>

175
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.125
What's wrong with you?

176
00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:38.125
Ah, I see. So, Dinda is not lying.

177
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:40.958
You will feel queasy...

178
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:43.500
when we're talking about Indonesian food.

179
00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:46.125
So that's why...

180
00:11:46.208 --> 00:11:50.333
when I asked Dinda to
make a shrimp paste sauce...

181
00:11:50.416 --> 00:11:52.000
it was nowhere to be seen.

182
00:11:52.708 --> 00:11:53.791
I'm sorry, Sir.

183
00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:56.625
I thought...

184
00:11:56.708 --> 00:12:01.583
you could use Mustika Rasa as reference.

185
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:04.791
But it's a pity that...

186
00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:08.625
our beloved Chef...

187
00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:12.625
is feeling nausea if we're
talking about Indonesian food.

188
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.250
About the test food.

189
00:12:17.333 --> 00:12:19.041
You could just send me the sample...

190
00:12:19.125 --> 00:12:22.708
on Monday morning and make a new menu...

191
00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:25.333
from the references that I give you.

192
00:12:26.791 --> 00:12:28.625
If you're not sure...

193
00:12:28.708 --> 00:12:32.208
then we should cancel...

194
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:34.000
the expansion plan to Italy.

195
00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:43.250
That's the door.

196
00:12:43.833 --> 00:12:45.041
Please...

197
00:12:45.916 --> 00:12:49.791
leave my office now.

198
00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:52.458
I'll deliver it on Monday, Sir.

199
00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:54.083
Thank you.

200
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.750
I feel bad about how
I left things with your Dad.

201
00:13:30.833 --> 00:13:33.416
<i>He's quite the nationalist.</i>

202
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.583
You are overthinking.

203
00:13:35.666 --> 00:13:37.208
Don't over think it.

204
00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:39.125
Alright.

205
00:13:39.875 --> 00:13:41.583
You're the only one who can make me calm.

206
00:13:42.916 --> 00:13:44.000
<i>Dinda.</i>

207
00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:45.916
I couldn't come tonight, is that alright?

208
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.833
<i>It's okay.</i>

209
00:13:48.583 --> 00:13:50.791
Let's celebrate
our anniversary tomorrow, okay?

210
00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:52.666
Alright.

211
00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:54.708
See you.

212
00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:01.416
Chef, can I have your authograph?

213
00:14:02.583 --> 00:14:03.625
Sure.

214
00:14:04.375 --> 00:14:06.166
Are you going to surprise your girlfriend?

215
00:14:08.416 --> 00:14:09.958
My soon-to-be wife.

216
00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:11.791
Thank you, Chef.

217
00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:13.000
- Here it is.
- All set?

218
00:14:13.083 --> 00:14:13.958
All set.

219
00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:15.875
- Thank you.
- Okay.

220
00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:26.083
You bastard!

221
00:15:29.583 --> 00:15:31.208
- You bastard!
- Ressa!

222
00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:36.333
Stop! Ressa, Alex, stop!

223
00:15:36.416 --> 00:15:37.625
Fuck you!

224
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.458
Ressa, Alex, stop!

225
00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:44.416
I can't believe it!

226
00:15:45.083 --> 00:15:46.958
You're cheating on our anniversary.

227
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.166
- I... I...
- She's mine now.

228
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.041
I didn't talk to you, you fucker!

229
00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.208
A self-proclaimed Chef,

230
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:56.083
who can't even distinguish spices. Idiot!

231
00:15:57.083 --> 00:15:58.208
At least

232
00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.375
I never feel nauseous or throw up...

233
00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.166
because of Indonesian food.

234
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.000
How long are you
going to hide your weakness?

235
00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:06.166
Listen, Chef.

236
00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:09.791
How can you create
perfection from your kitchen...

237
00:16:09.875 --> 00:16:11.208
if you have a handicap?

238
00:16:11.833 --> 00:16:13.416
And have a shit personality!

239
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.208
Fuck you! Bastard!

240
00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:31.625
Stop!

241
00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:34.333
Stop! Stop!

242
00:16:34.416 --> 00:16:36.500
Stop! Enough!

243
00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:44.291
Papa asked Alex to handle
the new concept of Maharasa.

244
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.541
The localized one.

245
00:16:47.083 --> 00:16:48.583
The one that is more Indonesian.

246
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.208
I'm sorry, Ressa.

247
00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:57.458
But Papa has made his decision,

248
00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:01.750
and I respect it.

249
00:17:10.541 --> 00:17:12.000
By not respecting my decision?

250
00:17:15.708 --> 00:17:16.708
Be happy you two.

251
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.375
<i>- Your mother is a prostitute!
- She's a slut!</i>

252
00:17:41.458 --> 00:17:42.291
<i>Slut!</i>

253
00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:43.541
<i>Open your mouth!</i>

254
00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:20.750
Where am I?

255
00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.541
You've had an accident

256
00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:25.416
and have been unconscious for four days.

257
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.750
You have to rest now.

258
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.208
Four days?

259
00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:38.666
No way.

260
00:18:41.291 --> 00:18:42.791
I have a food test.

261
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:44.500
You can eat it first,

262
00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:46.000
after that drink this medicine.

263
00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:47.416
I put the medicine in here.

264
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.458
THE DRIVER OF THE CRASHED MINI COOPER...

265
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:49.500
ALLEGEDLY IS A CELEBRITY CHEF.
AND HE WAS SENT TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL.

266
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.625
I'm sorry, Sir.

267
00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:10.250
It's hospital food,
of course it's not delicious.

268
00:19:11.458 --> 00:19:12.666
What are you doing here?

269
00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:16.541
I brought your favorite pasta.

270
00:19:21.041 --> 00:19:22.958
I also want to talk about your dream.

271
00:19:41.875 --> 00:19:43.166
I know...

272
00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:46.333
that Maharasa is not in your hands now,

273
00:19:46.916 --> 00:19:49.041
but I asked Papa
to still invest in your restaurant.

274
00:19:50.708 --> 00:19:51.958
He agrees, Ressa.

275
00:19:53.541 --> 00:19:55.333
He wants to give you more time.

276
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:58.958
We will have the food test...

277
00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:00.291
seven days after you're discharged.

278
00:20:03.416 --> 00:20:04.458
I believe that...

279
00:20:04.541 --> 00:20:06.083
you could invent an amazing dish...

280
00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:08.291
by combining
the Italian and Indonesian food.

281
00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:11.291
You could transform...

282
00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:14.500
a simple dish into something mind-blowing.

283
00:20:23.458 --> 00:20:24.333
Good luck, Ressa.

284
00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:00.166
I can smell the food

285
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.416
if I try to sniff it.

286
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.500
But if I try to eat it...

287
00:21:04.416 --> 00:21:06.458
whether it is salty or sweet...

288
00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:07.416
I can't taste anything.

289
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.708
What happened?

290
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.916
My hypothesis is that...

291
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.166
it could linked...

292
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.333
to stress or trauma.

293
00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:17.916
Let me schedule a meeting

294
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.958
with a psychiatrist.

295
00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:23.083
Or do you have someone in mind?

296
00:21:26.041 --> 00:21:26.958
I have.

297
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.500
Dr. Sanusi.

298
00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:31.625
Alright.

299
00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:33.875
I will call Dr. Sanusi.

300
00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:47.125
It's been five months
since the last time we met.

301
00:21:47.208 --> 00:21:49.750
- And now, you're here because...
- Doctor.

302
00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:54.875
What's wrong with my body?

303
00:21:56.375 --> 00:21:57.416
Dr. Bambang said it could be...

304
00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.500
linked to some trauma.

305
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.833
Okay, I know that...

306
00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:05.083
I can't smell local spices...

307
00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:06.750
because they bullied me

308
00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:08.458
by forcing me to swallow a shrimp paste.

309
00:22:09.416 --> 00:22:11.541
But now, I can't even taste anything!

310
00:22:13.458 --> 00:22:14.458
The good news is...

311
00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:15.500
Dr. Bambang said that

312
00:22:15.583 --> 00:22:18.291
there's nothing wrong
with your tongue. All clear.

313
00:22:18.375 --> 00:22:21.500
But the bad news is I cant taste anything.

314
00:22:21.583 --> 00:22:22.666
Look, Doctor.

315
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.666
I will have a food tasting.

316
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.000
A very important event for me,

317
00:22:27.083 --> 00:22:29.291
for my career, for my dreams.

318
00:22:29.916 --> 00:22:30.750
Please give me

319
00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:32.291
a medicine that could heal me

320
00:22:32.375 --> 00:22:33.500
in an instant.

321
00:22:33.583 --> 00:22:34.541
Alright, Doctor?

322
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.333
Do not bring up that
"make peace with your past," agenda.

323
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:44.541
I didn't say anything.

324
00:22:48.416 --> 00:22:50.833
You always say that.

325
00:22:52.583 --> 00:22:54.125
Okay.

326
00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.875
When will the food tasting be held?

327
00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:00.208
Next week.

328
00:23:00.833 --> 00:23:03.541
You have enough time
to go to Magelang, then.

329
00:23:03.625 --> 00:23:04.833
Eh, Ressa.

330
00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:06.375
What's the name of your childhood friend?

331
00:23:06.458 --> 00:23:07.708
Tika, right?

332
00:23:07.791 --> 00:23:09.375
Maybe you could heal your taste buds

333
00:23:09.458 --> 00:23:11.291
by meeting her.

334
00:23:11.375 --> 00:23:13.458
There should be another way, Doctor.

335
00:23:14.208 --> 00:23:15.041
Ressa.

336
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:17.666
Listen. Let say you're a building,

337
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.666
you're a beautiful skyscraper.

338
00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:24.000
But you don't have a sturdy foundation.

339
00:23:24.625 --> 00:23:27.041
So, the building could collapse anytime.

340
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.416
Then, how can
you make a good plan for the future?

341
00:23:33.208 --> 00:23:34.166
Here.

342
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.750
To relieve your stress.

343
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.625
Thank you, Doctor.

344
00:23:45.458 --> 00:23:46.833
I will excuse myself.

345
00:23:46.916 --> 00:23:48.333
Please consider my advice.

346
00:23:58.458 --> 00:23:59.541
Thank you.

347
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.833
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

348
00:24:14.916 --> 00:24:16.083
<i>You're cheating on our anniversary!</i>

349
00:24:16.166 --> 00:24:17.125
She's mine now.

350
00:24:17.208 --> 00:24:19.583
<i>Papa asked Alex to handle
the new concept of Maharasa.</i>

351
00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:20.958
The localized one.

352
00:24:21.625 --> 00:24:22.666
The one that is more Indonesian.

353
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.375
<i>Good morning Indonesia!</i>

354
00:24:46.458 --> 00:24:49.458
<i>You're back with me, Rahma Salsa.</i>

355
00:24:49.541 --> 00:24:53.583
<i>Today, I'm going to invite you to...</i>

356
00:24:53.666 --> 00:24:56.875
<i>Maybe you could heal
your taste buds by meeting her.</i>

357
00:24:56.958 --> 00:24:58.291
<i>...Sindoro hillside.</i>

358
00:24:59.458 --> 00:25:01.916
<i>Are you ready to
start your journey with me?</i>

359
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.250
<i>And here is our Magelang special episode.</i>

360
00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:19.958
<i>Come here with me.</i>

361
00:25:20.041 --> 00:25:21.166
<i>I'll teach you.</i>

362
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:25.041
Cut it like this.

363
00:25:25.125 --> 00:25:26.333
Try it.

364
00:25:28.916 --> 00:25:30.125
Smart boy.

365
00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:12.958
<i>Open your mouth!</i>

366
00:27:13.041 --> 00:27:15.041
Open your mouth!

367
00:27:15.125 --> 00:27:16.375
Go away!

368
00:27:17.625 --> 00:27:18.583
Go away!

369
00:27:18.666 --> 00:27:19.625
Go away!

370
00:27:24.208 --> 00:27:25.375
Rosso!

371
00:27:25.458 --> 00:27:26.750
Are you okay?

372
00:27:57.666 --> 00:27:59.041
Here, put it on your tongue.

373
00:28:01.583 --> 00:28:03.375
It will help.

374
00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:12.500
BINANGUN PHARMACY

375
00:29:54.916 --> 00:29:56.250
Thank you.

376
00:29:57.041 --> 00:29:58.541
Your monthly security fees.

377
00:29:58.625 --> 00:29:59.500
I don't have the money, Sir.

378
00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:01.791
I have to use it to pay
the interest to my boss.

379
00:30:01.875 --> 00:30:03.375
Do you want me to destroy this place?

380
00:30:03.458 --> 00:30:04.916
Alright, I'll pay you.

381
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.291
- Spare me.
- Hey, come here!

382
00:30:08.375 --> 00:30:09.708
Son of a prostitute!

383
00:30:10.583 --> 00:30:12.458
- Prostitute's son!
- Don't run!

384
00:30:13.208 --> 00:30:14.750
- You, a prostitute's son!
- Come here!

385
00:30:16.166 --> 00:30:17.416
Got you!

386
00:30:18.541 --> 00:30:21.500
Rosso, you're a prostitute's son.

387
00:30:21.583 --> 00:30:22.541
How dare you!

388
00:30:23.541 --> 00:30:24.541
You deserve it!

389
00:30:25.583 --> 00:30:26.833
Here.

390
00:30:27.375 --> 00:30:28.958
Open your mouth! Open it!

391
00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:37.166
Rosso Surosso!

392
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.250
Finally you're back.

393
00:30:39.333 --> 00:30:41.416
You're so handsome now!

394
00:30:41.958 --> 00:30:44.041
You smell nice.

395
00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:45.375
You're Rosso Surosso, right?

396
00:30:45.458 --> 00:30:46.625
No, you're mistaken.

397
00:30:46.708 --> 00:30:48.125
How can I be?

398
00:30:48.208 --> 00:30:50.125
I'm Tarjo. Do I look very different now?

399
00:30:50.208 --> 00:30:51.416
We're still the same, though.

400
00:30:52.291 --> 00:30:53.916
Take off your sunglasses.

401
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.958
So you can see me clearly.

402
00:30:56.041 --> 00:30:58.291
Is your prostitute
mother in Jakarta already gone?

403
00:30:58.375 --> 00:30:59.500
Is that why you're back?

404
00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:03.000
Alumni of prostitutes are back!

405
00:31:03.083 --> 00:31:05.333
I could even smell
sperm on the sunglasses.

406
00:31:05.416 --> 00:31:06.375
Let's go.

407
00:31:07.041 --> 00:31:08.375
Everyone, the prostitute's son is back!

408
00:31:08.458 --> 00:31:09.958
What a nice thing to see.

409
00:31:10.833 --> 00:31:12.125
What's wrong with you?

410
00:31:12.208 --> 00:31:13.208
Fuck you!

411
00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:16.750
Bastard!

412
00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:24.083
Mind your own business, Tika!

413
00:31:24.166 --> 00:31:25.500
You never stop!

414
00:31:30.375 --> 00:31:31.333
Mind your own business, Tika!

415
00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:35.000
Damn you, Tika.

416
00:31:35.083 --> 00:31:36.041
Just give up!

417
00:31:36.625 --> 00:31:37.625
Give up!

418
00:31:37.708 --> 00:31:39.083
Alright, Tika!

419
00:31:39.166 --> 00:31:40.416
Tika, stop!

420
00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:44.958
Let's go!

421
00:31:45.041 --> 00:31:45.875
Come on.

422
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:48.541
Damn you.

423
00:31:57.875 --> 00:31:58.708
Tika.

424
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:08.958
Just go back.

425
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.083
I don't know you anymore.

426
00:32:29.458 --> 00:32:30.333
Have you called Tika?

427
00:32:30.416 --> 00:32:32.458
I have.

428
00:32:34.666 --> 00:32:36.041
Why is she so slow?

429
00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:45.166
Gareng! Help me!

430
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.333
Alright.

431
00:32:47.416 --> 00:32:49.166
She brings so many things.

432
00:32:51.125 --> 00:32:52.666
Tika, why are the vegetables not fresh?

433
00:32:53.833 --> 00:32:55.333
The tomatos are crushed!

434
00:32:55.416 --> 00:32:56.958
Because of Tarjo.

435
00:32:58.875 --> 00:33:00.333
Tarjo the thug?

436
00:33:00.416 --> 00:33:02.333
So that's why you're late.

437
00:33:04.458 --> 00:33:06.583
Ah, that's right.

438
00:33:07.166 --> 00:33:09.750
It's the time they ask
for money from the shop.

439
00:33:16.833 --> 00:33:18.708
What's wrong with your hands?

440
00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:21.708
Did you fight with them?

441
00:33:22.583 --> 00:33:23.958
A little bit.

442
00:33:24.041 --> 00:33:25.583
A lady shouldn't be fighting.

443
00:33:25.666 --> 00:33:26.750
The coriander please.

444
00:33:28.083 --> 00:33:29.791
A lady should cook.

445
00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:32.791
Work hard, so you can have a lot of money.

446
00:33:34.708 --> 00:33:35.875
I'm tired of cooking.

447
00:33:36.791 --> 00:33:38.041
You always have an answer.

448
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.750
- Here, thank you.
- You're welcome.

449
00:33:51.416 --> 00:33:54.875
GRANDMA WONGSO RESTAURANT

450
00:33:54.958 --> 00:33:57.291
Why are they not open yet?

451
00:34:00.916 --> 00:34:01.875
They're not open yet.

452
00:34:01.958 --> 00:34:02.958
Where are you from?

453
00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:04.500
Jogja, Sir.

454
00:34:04.583 --> 00:34:05.791
Jogja? That's far!

455
00:34:05.875 --> 00:34:07.416
Yes, we set off early,

456
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.000
so we can grab a seat here.

457
00:34:09.083 --> 00:34:11.625
People said
the Mangut they serve is very delicious.

458
00:34:11.708 --> 00:34:12.875
That's right.

459
00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:19.791
If you're cooking from the heart,
the food will be delicious.

460
00:34:19.875 --> 00:34:21.416
Am I right, Gareng?

461
00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:23.625
Sis.

462
00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:24.916
Pass me the lemongrass
and the lime leaves.

463
00:34:53.875 --> 00:34:55.875
Welcome!

464
00:34:55.958 --> 00:34:57.000
Come on.

465
00:34:57.083 --> 00:34:58.333
No need to worry!

466
00:34:58.416 --> 00:35:00.791
We made a big portion for everyone.

467
00:35:02.458 --> 00:35:03.750
Please come in.

468
00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:05.958
Let's go in.

469
00:35:07.375 --> 00:35:08.916
Come in, come in.

470
00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:28.041
What about the drinks?

471
00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:31.791
- Ice tea.
- Then it will be Rp27.000.

472
00:35:33.583 --> 00:35:34.541
Done, right?

473
00:35:34.625 --> 00:35:35.833
Rp27.000, right?

474
00:35:35.916 --> 00:35:37.666
The change amount is...

475
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.125
Wait a moment. Here's the change.

476
00:35:48.208 --> 00:35:49.708
- I'm going back.
- Take care.

477
00:35:49.791 --> 00:35:50.791
Okay.

478
00:35:50.875 --> 00:35:52.250
Send my regards to Grandma.

479
00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:53.500
Okay.

480
00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:02.666
- Tika.
- What do you want?

481
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:03.916
I need to talk to you.

482
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.708
I don't want to. Give it back!

483
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:07.375
- Just talk for a moment.
- Give my key back!

484
00:36:07.458 --> 00:36:08.458
Give it back!

485
00:36:10.916 --> 00:36:12.500
I'll give it back to you once we're talking.

486
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.291
Oh, my...

487
00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:19.166
Tika!

488
00:36:20.125 --> 00:36:21.625
Let's talk for a while, okay?

489
00:36:23.083 --> 00:36:23.958
Okay?

490
00:36:27.083 --> 00:36:28.666
Who is it?

491
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:30.166
I don't know either.

492
00:36:30.875 --> 00:36:32.333
Here's your drink.

493
00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:34.583
Thank you.

494
00:36:34.666 --> 00:36:35.875
You're welcome.

495
00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:39.458
It's okay if we go home,

496
00:36:39.541 --> 00:36:40.916
right?

497
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.375
It's okay.

498
00:36:42.958 --> 00:36:44.625
Just go home.

499
00:36:45.166 --> 00:36:47.583
I'll close the restaurant later.

500
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:50.875
Everything is okay, right?

501
00:36:52.958 --> 00:36:54.750
- Yes.
- Of course! It should be okay!

502
00:36:55.833 --> 00:36:57.041
You force them to be okay!

503
00:36:57.583 --> 00:36:58.625
Alright, Tika.

504
00:36:59.333 --> 00:37:00.416
We'll go.

505
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.666
Take care.

506
00:37:14.083 --> 00:37:14.958
Tika.

507
00:37:16.166 --> 00:37:18.041
I came here to ask you for a favor.

508
00:37:18.625 --> 00:37:19.791
Years of no words

509
00:37:19.875 --> 00:37:21.958
and you come back here for a favor?

510
00:37:23.375 --> 00:37:25.666
I know I was wrong.

511
00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:28.708
I'm sorry.

512
00:37:30.875 --> 00:37:33.625
I know you're angry because
I didn't reply to all your letters, right?

513
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:38.458
You think I don't wanna talk to you

514
00:37:38.541 --> 00:37:39.541
just because of that?

515
00:37:39.625 --> 00:37:40.708
Then,

516
00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:41.833
why are you angry?

517
00:37:49.083 --> 00:37:50.000
<i>Anyway...</i>

518
00:37:50.083 --> 00:37:51.375
<i>for everyone at home,</i>

519
00:37:51.458 --> 00:37:54.708
<i>you may already know that Chef Ressa</i>

520
00:37:54.791 --> 00:37:57.208
<i>- was born in Jakarta.
- Right.</i>

521
00:37:57.291 --> 00:38:00.208
<i>But raised in Italy with your father,</i>

522
00:38:00.291 --> 00:38:02.333
<i>- then you came back to Jakarta.
- That's right.</i>

523
00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:04.208
<i>- Until today?
- Yes, since then I'm staying here.</i>

524
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:05.583
<i>Okay.</i>

525
00:38:05.666 --> 00:38:07.750
<i>I heard when
you and your assistant are talking,</i>

526
00:38:07.833 --> 00:38:09.333
<i>and I think I hear you're talking in...</i>

527
00:38:10.958 --> 00:38:12.791
I know this place is only a small village,

528
00:38:12.875 --> 00:38:14.500
that is full of poor
farmers who's fate has always

529
00:38:14.583 --> 00:38:17.250
been played by those
rich people from Jakarta.

530
00:38:18.333 --> 00:38:21.500
- Tika.
- You're lying to the public.

531
00:38:22.291 --> 00:38:23.875
And the worst thing is...

532
00:38:25.375 --> 00:38:26.625
you're lying to Grandma,

533
00:38:26.708 --> 00:38:27.791
who took care of you all this time.

534
00:38:30.458 --> 00:38:32.083
What are you expecting?

535
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.916
Tell the world that I was adopted?

536
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.833
Is that it?

537
00:38:36.916 --> 00:38:38.333
Tell them that I as a Chef,

538
00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.333
I can't smell local spices,

539
00:38:40.416 --> 00:38:41.500
or else I'll throw up?

540
00:38:41.583 --> 00:38:42.875
I don't know!

541
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.041
But I know for sure,
you already forgot this place.

542
00:38:59.166 --> 00:39:00.583
Rosso.

543
00:39:00.666 --> 00:39:02.291
For your information,

544
00:39:02.375 --> 00:39:04.125
everyone here is proud of you

545
00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:06.375
because you are
a very successful Chef in Jakarta.

546
00:39:10.291 --> 00:39:12.041
Many of them even think that

547
00:39:12.125 --> 00:39:13.875
you became an incredible Chef

548
00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:16.166
because of this restaurant.

549
00:39:18.375 --> 00:39:19.541
You don't know that, do you?

550
00:39:23.458 --> 00:39:24.500
But it is what it is.

551
00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:26.500
It's already in the past.

552
00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.208
And now me,

553
00:39:30.791 --> 00:39:32.041
Grandma,

554
00:39:32.125 --> 00:39:33.208
and you,

555
00:39:34.916 --> 00:39:36.750
should continue
our lives separately like before.

556
00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:39.666
So, just enjoy this
town like many tourists

557
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:41.833
who come here for healing.

558
00:39:42.416 --> 00:39:43.250
I'm going home.

559
00:39:44.041 --> 00:39:44.916
Tika.

560
00:39:45.958 --> 00:39:46.875
Wait.

561
00:39:47.375 --> 00:39:48.833
I wanna see Grandma.

562
00:39:51.416 --> 00:39:52.625
Bet you will throw up.

563
00:39:54.208 --> 00:39:56.375
Since Grandma's
house is full of local spices.

564
00:40:08.083 --> 00:40:09.125
Oh my God!

565
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.291
Your Grandma is in
her bedroom with Grandpa Darmo.

566
00:40:33.375 --> 00:40:35.250
- See your Grandma first.
- Okay.

567
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:40.625
Grandma.

568
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.333
Asked her to drink this, Tika.

569
00:40:47.416 --> 00:40:49.291
I already made...

570
00:40:49.375 --> 00:40:52.541
tumeric with garlic...

571
00:40:52.625 --> 00:40:54.666
and a little bit of palm sugar.

572
00:40:55.416 --> 00:40:56.583
Thank you.

573
00:40:56.666 --> 00:40:57.541
Please,

574
00:40:57.625 --> 00:40:58.541
have a seat.

575
00:40:58.625 --> 00:40:59.958
Yes, thank you.

576
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:01.166
Let's go.

577
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.583
Come on.

578
00:41:07.458 --> 00:41:08.416
Sir.

579
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.500
That man...

580
00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:11.166
He's like a celebrity

581
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:12.583
He's not an artist, Yu!

582
00:41:12.666 --> 00:41:13.958
He's a Chef.

583
00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:15.041
Ressa, I made...

584
00:41:15.125 --> 00:41:17.875
Tika's favorite food.

585
00:41:17.958 --> 00:41:18.875
Have a try.

586
00:41:19.625 --> 00:41:20.750
Is it tasty?

587
00:41:21.375 --> 00:41:22.666
Very tasty, Grandma!

588
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.875
Eat more, okay.

589
00:41:29.125 --> 00:41:29.958
Rosso.

590
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:31.625
Rosso Suroso.

591
00:41:31.708 --> 00:41:32.958
What a good name.

592
00:41:34.875 --> 00:41:37.250
Rosso means strength.

593
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.416
It could also mean taste.

594
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:44.041
And Suroso, it means "enlighten".

595
00:41:44.708 --> 00:41:47.208
Then, if we combine Rosso Suroso...

596
00:41:47.958 --> 00:41:50.291
it means
"the strength that is enlightening".

597
00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:52.958
Or taste that is enlightening?

598
00:41:54.375 --> 00:41:56.500
What a smart boy!

599
00:41:57.958 --> 00:42:01.041
Continue eating, Rosso.

600
00:42:01.125 --> 00:42:03.416
- Tika, eat more.
- Yes, Grandma.

601
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.875
Really?

602
00:42:04.958 --> 00:42:06.541
How can a Chef be so handsome?

603
00:42:06.625 --> 00:42:08.166
Yes, he's handsome.

604
00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:09.750
He must've taken care of himself well.

605
00:42:09.833 --> 00:42:11.083
You're right.

606
00:42:12.125 --> 00:42:13.000
Look at him.

607
00:42:13.083 --> 00:42:14.416
Young man, I'm sorry.

608
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.083
Are you Chef Ressa...

609
00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:17.666
that we've seen on TV?

610
00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:19.125
That's right, Sir.

611
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:21.458
The one who likes to throw away...

612
00:42:21.541 --> 00:42:23.166
the untasteful food to the trash bin?

613
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.125
Yes.

614
00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:25.125
Oh my.

615
00:42:26.083 --> 00:42:28.125
Can I ask for a photo?

616
00:42:28.208 --> 00:42:29.166
Sure.

617
00:42:30.416 --> 00:42:32.458
Yu! Take a photo of me and him.

618
00:42:32.541 --> 00:42:33.500
- Photo?
- Yeah.

619
00:42:33.583 --> 00:42:34.416
Grandpa Darmo,

620
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.625
why are you here?

621
00:42:36.708 --> 00:42:39.958
I had a bad feeling since the afternoon.

622
00:42:40.041 --> 00:42:41.333
I was thinking about your Grandma.

623
00:42:41.916 --> 00:42:43.875
That's why I'm here.

624
00:42:43.958 --> 00:42:45.791
When I arrived

625
00:42:45.875 --> 00:42:47.416
I heard a loud sound.

626
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.333
- What happened?
- I thought there was a thief.

627
00:42:49.416 --> 00:42:50.500
But it turns out your Grandma...

628
00:42:50.583 --> 00:42:51.958
fell near the well.

629
00:42:52.625 --> 00:42:53.833
Rosso.

630
00:42:53.916 --> 00:42:54.958
Grandma?

631
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:57.083
Rosso.

632
00:42:57.166 --> 00:42:58.750
Smile! One, two, three.

633
00:42:58.833 --> 00:42:59.875
Rosso.

634
00:42:59.958 --> 00:43:01.291
Who's outside?

635
00:43:02.375 --> 00:43:04.500
Why is it so loud outside?

636
00:43:06.541 --> 00:43:08.708
- Done.
- Let me look at the photos.

637
00:43:09.541 --> 00:43:11.416
- Let me see.
- One more thing,

638
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.416
is it true that...

639
00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.916
you're from this town?

640
00:43:16.083 --> 00:43:18.291
He was raised here.

641
00:43:18.375 --> 00:43:20.041
Grandma took care of him.

642
00:43:21.583 --> 00:43:23.291
Rosso. Grandma is looking for you.

643
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.750
- I'm going in first, Sir.
- Sure, sure.

644
00:43:26.833 --> 00:43:28.416
- Ma'am.
- Go ahead.

645
00:43:32.125 --> 00:43:34.208
Rosso...

646
00:43:35.166 --> 00:43:38.916
I wanna see you, Rosso.

647
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:39.958
Grandpa.

648
00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:47.625
Rosso.

649
00:43:47.708 --> 00:43:48.666
Grandma.

650
00:43:50.333 --> 00:43:51.625
I'm here. This is Rosso.

651
00:43:55.541 --> 00:43:58.041
Thank God!

652
00:43:59.208 --> 00:44:01.958
You're back now.

653
00:44:06.666 --> 00:44:08.541
I'm home, Grandma.

654
00:44:30.291 --> 00:44:31.833
What's wrong?

655
00:44:31.916 --> 00:44:32.750
Are you gonna throw up?

656
00:44:35.291 --> 00:44:37.125
What's wrong, Rosso?

657
00:44:37.833 --> 00:44:39.041
Grandma.

658
00:44:39.125 --> 00:44:41.125
You shouldn't be nice to him.

659
00:44:41.708 --> 00:44:43.166
He already forgot us.

660
00:44:44.958 --> 00:44:46.291
Is that true?

661
00:44:46.375 --> 00:44:47.708
Ask him yourself.

662
00:44:47.791 --> 00:44:50.416
He doesn't even
want to mention this village.

663
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.333
Am I right?

664
00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:55.083
We can't measure whether someone...

665
00:44:55.166 --> 00:44:56.375
remembers us or not by...

666
00:44:56.458 --> 00:44:59.625
how often they call our names.

667
00:44:59.708 --> 00:45:01.250
Our memory is here...

668
00:45:01.333 --> 00:45:03.416
and here.

669
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.833
If he misses us, then he remember us.

670
00:45:16.791 --> 00:45:19.125
Don't force yourself...

671
00:45:19.208 --> 00:45:20.416
if you can't eat this village's food.

672
00:45:21.583 --> 00:45:23.125
Mustika.

673
00:45:23.208 --> 00:45:24.541
Grandma, I can't taste anything.

674
00:45:25.666 --> 00:45:26.833
How come?

675
00:45:27.916 --> 00:45:29.125
A problematic man.

676
00:45:30.625 --> 00:45:32.666
Nausea if you smell local spices.

677
00:45:33.333 --> 00:45:34.333
Loses his taste buds.

678
00:45:34.416 --> 00:45:35.458
I'm not lying, Tika.

679
00:45:39.291 --> 00:45:40.333
Mustika!

680
00:45:40.916 --> 00:45:41.875
Eat this.

681
00:45:42.708 --> 00:45:44.541
Show me if you lost your taste buds.

682
00:45:50.583 --> 00:45:52.000
Oh My God!

683
00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:53.541
What happened to you?

684
00:45:56.208 --> 00:45:57.791
I was in car accident, Grandma.

685
00:45:58.416 --> 00:46:00.041
I was unconscious for days,

686
00:46:00.125 --> 00:46:01.250
but when I woke up,

687
00:46:01.833 --> 00:46:03.333
I had already lost my taste buds.

688
00:46:04.166 --> 00:46:05.416
I can smell everything.

689
00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.541
But...

690
00:46:06.625 --> 00:46:08.500
my tongue can't taste anything.

691
00:46:09.083 --> 00:46:10.375
The doctor said...

692
00:46:11.875 --> 00:46:13.291
- it might be caused by...
- Stress?

693
00:46:14.541 --> 00:46:15.750
Or unfinished trauma?

694
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.416
Come with me.

695
00:46:32.375 --> 00:46:33.333
Where are we going, Grandma?

696
00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:35.833
Just follow me.

697
00:46:56.791 --> 00:46:58.500
As long as the soul is here,

698
00:46:58.583 --> 00:47:01.250
there's no way the taste buds die.

699
00:47:01.333 --> 00:47:02.958
They're only asleep.

700
00:47:03.791 --> 00:47:06.750
Your chaotic mind caused all of that.

701
00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:09.958
Bring me the water, Tika.

702
00:47:12.291 --> 00:47:13.250
- Here, Grandma.
- Here.

703
00:47:17.333 --> 00:47:18.166
Enough.

704
00:47:22.208 --> 00:47:23.291
Drink it.

705
00:47:25.583 --> 00:47:26.875
What is that?

706
00:47:26.958 --> 00:47:29.875
What a fussy man! Just drink it!

707
00:47:29.958 --> 00:47:31.458
You don't wanna be cured?

708
00:47:32.958 --> 00:47:34.000
Drink it.

709
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.541
I can't stand the smell.

710
00:47:38.625 --> 00:47:40.666
Bear with it.

711
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.333
Drink it, Rosso.

712
00:47:48.583 --> 00:47:50.250
Is it done? Finish it!

713
00:47:55.791 --> 00:47:57.708
If you're feeling dizzy,

714
00:47:57.791 --> 00:48:00.375
that means the medicine is working.

715
00:48:05.375 --> 00:48:06.916
Have you cleaned up his room?

716
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.291
Not yet.

717
00:48:09.208 --> 00:48:11.750
He can't stand by himself if he's giddy.

718
00:48:11.833 --> 00:48:13.125
What time is it?

719
00:48:13.708 --> 00:48:15.000
It's 7 o'clock.

720
00:48:15.625 --> 00:48:17.458
I have to go to the restaurant.

721
00:48:17.541 --> 00:48:18.416
Wait up, Tika.

722
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.250
He's already unsteady.

723
00:48:20.333 --> 00:48:22.208
- Help him!
- Grandma.

724
00:48:22.291 --> 00:48:23.750
I'm not strong enough to help him!

725
00:48:24.333 --> 00:48:25.166
Hurry up!

726
00:48:26.208 --> 00:48:27.041
Hurry up!

727
00:48:29.125 --> 00:48:30.041
Slowly.

728
00:48:41.958 --> 00:48:44.791
Put me down here.

729
00:49:37.375 --> 00:49:38.208
Grandma.

730
00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:40.541
Let's eat, Rosso.

731
00:49:40.625 --> 00:49:41.666
Come here.

732
00:49:42.541 --> 00:49:43.625
Grandma.

733
00:49:47.833 --> 00:49:48.791
Here.

734
00:49:50.375 --> 00:49:51.208
Let's eat.

735
00:49:51.916 --> 00:49:53.250
Thank you, Grandma.

736
00:49:59.208 --> 00:50:00.041
For you, Grandma.

737
00:50:00.125 --> 00:50:01.250
Thank you.

738
00:50:08.083 --> 00:50:10.208
Eat up, Rosso, try it.

739
00:50:10.291 --> 00:50:11.500
I'm famished!

740
00:50:13.416 --> 00:50:14.458
Is it nice?

741
00:50:16.875 --> 00:50:17.791
It's delicious!

742
00:50:20.333 --> 00:50:21.583
You already woke up?

743
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:23.791
You slept like a dead man.

744
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.083
What do you mean?
I only slept for an hour.

745
00:50:26.166 --> 00:50:27.541
An hour?

746
00:50:27.625 --> 00:50:28.500
You're dreaming.

747
00:50:29.666 --> 00:50:30.791
I slept for an hour!

748
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:34.708
Grandma.

749
00:50:35.416 --> 00:50:37.625
Did I sleep for 25 hours?

750
00:50:38.791 --> 00:50:41.708
That means your body needs a total rest.

751
00:50:43.083 --> 00:50:45.166
Are you that stressed in Jakarta?

752
00:50:45.958 --> 00:50:48.583
He's stressed because he lies every day.

753
00:50:48.666 --> 00:50:49.750
Tika!

754
00:50:50.833 --> 00:50:51.791
I'm right, aren't I?

755
00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:53.708
She's not wrong, Grandma.

756
00:50:54.958 --> 00:50:56.833
Ever since I moved to Jakarta,

757
00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.458
I started to forget my true self.

758
00:51:02.625 --> 00:51:04.166
My mother, she changed my name...

759
00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:06.333
so I could start a new life,

760
00:51:07.541 --> 00:51:08.375
and also...

761
00:51:08.958 --> 00:51:10.333
forget my childhood trauma.

762
00:51:11.458 --> 00:51:12.458
But I don't know why,

763
00:51:12.541 --> 00:51:17.000
I always strive for the best.

764
00:51:17.083 --> 00:51:18.916
I keep chasing things...

765
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.958
even though no one asked me to.

766
00:51:22.375 --> 00:51:23.333
For me...

767
00:51:24.958 --> 00:51:26.250
that's tiring.

768
00:51:26.333 --> 00:51:28.375
Even just hearing it makes me exhausted.

769
00:51:30.708 --> 00:51:31.750
Tika!

770
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:41.000
Is that spicy?

771
00:51:41.083 --> 00:51:42.250
Yes.

772
00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:43.625
Didn't you say you lost your taste buds?

773
00:51:44.583 --> 00:51:45.958
That's a quick reaction.

774
00:51:46.708 --> 00:51:47.708
Are you really sick?

775
00:51:50.291 --> 00:51:51.458
Grandma.

776
00:51:54.083 --> 00:51:55.375
I'm cured.

777
00:51:59.833 --> 00:52:01.291
You don't believe in...

778
00:52:01.375 --> 00:52:05.041
my traditional medicine potion, do you?

779
00:52:05.125 --> 00:52:07.791
That's not true,
but usually it's not that fast.

780
00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:11.625
Each body reacts
to the potion differently.

781
00:52:13.041 --> 00:52:15.416
But, the effect isn't permanent.

782
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:16.958
You shouldn't feel relief yet.

783
00:52:17.791 --> 00:52:22.416
You might lose your taste buds again

784
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.416
if your mind is still a mess.

785
00:52:25.375 --> 00:52:29.291
The potion only helps
you to tone down the problem.

786
00:52:30.125 --> 00:52:33.083
You're the only one who knows...

787
00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:35.416
how to cure it.

788
00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:40.625
But Grandma,

789
00:52:40.708 --> 00:52:43.708
how long will the effect last?

790
00:52:44.583 --> 00:52:46.375
I have to go back to Jakarta,

791
00:52:46.458 --> 00:52:48.000
because I have to do a food tasting.

792
00:52:53.916 --> 00:52:57.500
It will only last for three days.

793
00:52:58.083 --> 00:53:01.083
But I won't stop you if
you want to go back to Jakarta.

794
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.250
But I can't do anything,

795
00:53:06.333 --> 00:53:08.708
if you lose your taste buds again.

796
00:53:15.791 --> 00:53:18.541
<i>Your Grandma's potion
is a stress reliever.</i>

797
00:53:19.583 --> 00:53:20.791
<i>It's the same thing as the antidepressant</i>

798
00:53:20.875 --> 00:53:21.791
<i>that I gave you before,</i>

799
00:53:21.875 --> 00:53:23.166
<i>but you said...</i>

800
00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:25.291
<i>it doesn't work.</i>

801
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.041
<i>There's no clinical explanation...</i>

802
00:53:29.625 --> 00:53:32.541
<i>but it's a complementary medicine,</i>

803
00:53:32.625 --> 00:53:34.750
<i>or it is called alternative treatment.</i>

804
00:53:36.083 --> 00:53:39.333
<i>I advise you to continue your stay there.</i>

805
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.250
<i>Enjoy the fresh air and the peaceful town.</i>

806
00:53:45.458 --> 00:53:46.708
<i>It might be...</i>

807
00:53:47.583 --> 00:53:50.458
<i>that you not only cure your taste buds,</i>

808
00:53:50.541 --> 00:53:53.166
<i>but also your childhood trauma.</i>

809
00:54:13.041 --> 00:54:14.083
The Mangut, a fish dish with coconut sauce

810
00:54:14.166 --> 00:54:15.333
is completely sold out!

811
00:54:15.416 --> 00:54:17.500
Ma'am, where's the Mangut?

812
00:54:19.208 --> 00:54:20.916
Please, wait a moment.

813
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.666
Alright, alright. Please wait a moment.

814
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:25.625
Please serve more Mangut.

815
00:54:25.708 --> 00:54:27.583
Tika, hurry up!

816
00:54:27.666 --> 00:54:29.833
I only have two hands!

817
00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.000
Oh My God, be careful.

818
00:54:33.083 --> 00:54:34.583
The plaster is there!

819
00:54:34.666 --> 00:54:36.458
Come on, where is it?

820
00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:39.375
- I'm very hungry!
- Where is it?

821
00:54:39.458 --> 00:54:41.333
Gareng.

822
00:54:41.416 --> 00:54:43.000
Where is it?

823
00:54:43.083 --> 00:54:44.541
Gareng.

824
00:54:44.625 --> 00:54:46.416
Please wait a moment.

825
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:47.916
Hurry up, Tika!

826
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:48.958
Wait!

827
00:54:49.041 --> 00:54:49.875
Let me help you.

828
00:54:49.958 --> 00:54:51.583
No one asked you to come here.

829
00:54:51.666 --> 00:54:53.500
Just let me help you.

830
00:54:53.583 --> 00:54:54.625
Please wait for 30 minutes.

831
00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:55.958
Where is it? We're hungry!

832
00:54:57.666 --> 00:54:58.541
- We waited a long time.
- I am hungry!

833
00:54:58.625 --> 00:55:01.708
Everyone calm down.

834
00:55:03.125 --> 00:55:06.125
I'm going to cook
Mangut with my own recipe.

835
00:55:06.208 --> 00:55:07.166
Of course,

836
00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:09.500
without changing...

837
00:55:09.583 --> 00:55:10.833
the uniqueness of this place.

838
00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:12.583
Don't try to seek attention.

839
00:55:12.666 --> 00:55:13.958
This is not an Italian restaurant!

840
00:55:15.791 --> 00:55:17.666
Alright, let's have a bet, then.

841
00:55:18.291 --> 00:55:19.708
If the taste is...

842
00:55:19.791 --> 00:55:21.000
not up to this restaurant's standard,

843
00:55:21.083 --> 00:55:22.000
or unsatisfying.

844
00:55:22.083 --> 00:55:23.250
I will pay you Rp100,000.

845
00:55:24.083 --> 00:55:26.083
But if it's on par...

846
00:55:26.166 --> 00:55:27.500
or above your standard,

847
00:55:28.083 --> 00:55:29.541
you're the one who will pay me Rp100,000.

848
00:55:30.333 --> 00:55:31.541
How about that?

849
00:55:31.625 --> 00:55:33.250
- What's going on?
- Do we agree?

850
00:55:33.333 --> 00:55:35.125
Agree!

851
00:55:35.208 --> 00:55:36.416
Calm down, Sis.

852
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.333
I will help you.

853
00:55:39.416 --> 00:55:40.958
I put my bet on you!

854
00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:42.708
Come on.

855
00:55:42.791 --> 00:55:44.458
Okay.

856
00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:46.000
Let me cut this one.

857
00:55:46.083 --> 00:55:47.625
You can work on this one.

858
00:55:47.708 --> 00:55:49.333
Please hurry up!

859
00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.916
It's still in progress.

860
00:55:52.541 --> 00:55:54.125
Please wait.

861
00:55:54.208 --> 00:55:55.833
Isn't that Chef Ressa?

862
00:55:56.916 --> 00:55:59.083
- Who?
- Really?

863
00:56:00.041 --> 00:56:02.958
I'll take a video of him!

864
00:56:03.041 --> 00:56:06.000
Do not film this!

865
00:56:06.083 --> 00:56:07.333
- Go away.
- Do not film this.

866
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Be careful. It's still hot.
Please get back in the queue.

867
00:56:55.625 --> 00:57:00.125
Please, wait in line so
that everyone could get some.

868
00:57:47.625 --> 00:57:51.958
<i>The potion only helps
you to tone down the problem.</i>

869
00:57:52.041 --> 00:57:53.833
<i>You're the only one who knows...</i>

870
00:57:53.916 --> 00:57:55.375
<i>how to cure it.</i>

871
00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:00.083
Rosso.

872
00:58:00.708 --> 00:58:01.750
Are you okay, Rosso?

873
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.333
<i>How's the Mangut?</i>

874
01:00:09.416 --> 01:00:10.750
Very delicious!

875
01:00:10.833 --> 01:00:11.958
The taste of this Mangut is different!

876
01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:13.333
It's tastier than the usual.

877
01:00:13.416 --> 01:00:15.333
Did you change the cook?

878
01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:18.791
Of course, she is.

879
01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:20.291
- Still the same person?
- Yeah, we're still on the same team.

880
01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:22.208
Everything is so delicious.

881
01:00:22.291 --> 01:00:23.166
Okay, if you want to eat it again,

882
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:24.083
you can go directly to the buffet.

883
01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:26.250
Of course I will!

884
01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:37.916
<i>Chef! Move, move!</i>

885
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.125
<i>Chef Ressa, Chef Ressa!</i>

886
01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:40.500
<i>Move, move!</i>

887
01:00:40.583 --> 01:00:41.458
<i>Do not film it.</i>

888
01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:43.833
- <i>Chef Ressa, Chef Ressa!</i>
- Chef!

889
01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:45.625
<i>It's so cool that...</i>

890
01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:47.708
<i>Chef Ressa cooks for us!</i>

891
01:00:47.791 --> 01:00:50.166
<i>My God! Do not disturb me!</i>

892
01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:52.791
<i>- Chef Ressa!
- Stop it.</i>

893
01:00:52.875 --> 01:00:54.416
<i>Chef Ressa.</i>

894
01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:00.375
I admit, I lose.

895
01:01:08.166 --> 01:01:09.000
Gareng.

896
01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:10.583
Yes?

897
01:01:14.208 --> 01:01:15.625
Thank you for your support.

898
01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:19.208
I can use it for a cooperative deposit!

899
01:01:24.041 --> 01:01:26.291
If I want to be a cook here,

900
01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:29.833
where should I send my resume?

901
01:01:37.291 --> 01:01:39.583
Or maybe I could just help around, right?

902
01:01:46.083 --> 01:01:47.208
Have you seen this?

903
01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:52.750
<i>Chef Ressa, Chef Ressa!</i>

904
01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:54.583
<i>It's so cool...</i>

905
01:02:04.583 --> 01:02:06.166
Thank you...

906
01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:07.541
for helping in the restaurant.

907
01:02:11.083 --> 01:02:13.833
And thank you, for letting me
cook in your restaurant.

908
01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:19.166
Because of you, we already
surpassed our target for this month.

909
01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:24.458
I'm sorry.

910
01:02:25.916 --> 01:02:28.375
I didn't treat you well before.

911
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:33.791
It's okay.

912
01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:37.000
I deserve it.

913
01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:43.333
I was angry because I was brokenhearted.

914
01:02:46.416 --> 01:02:47.375
You...

915
01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:50.791
who made my heart broken.

916
01:02:54.333 --> 01:02:56.208
<i>I was jealous</i>

917
01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:58.291
<i>when your Aunt came to pick you up.</i>

918
01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:00.666
<i>You had a new mom,</i>

919
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:01.791
<i>not like me.</i>

920
01:03:02.416 --> 01:03:03.291
Tika.

921
01:03:03.875 --> 01:03:05.541
Who sent that letter?

922
01:03:05.625 --> 01:03:06.958
It's a letter from Rosso, Grandma.

923
01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:08.208
Rosso?

924
01:03:08.291 --> 01:03:09.416
Yes.

925
01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:13.083
<i>I was so happy
when you sent me that letter.</i>

926
01:03:13.666 --> 01:03:15.291
<i>I even...</i>

927
01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.583
<i>replied right away
and told you my stories.</i>

928
01:03:17.666 --> 01:03:18.500
Excuse me, Ma'am.

929
01:03:22.125 --> 01:03:24.000
- Sir.
- Excuse me!

930
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.416
<i>But your letter has never come again.</i>

931
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.333
Tika!

932
01:03:32.833 --> 01:03:35.708
<i>Even when I sent you several letters.</i>

933
01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:37.250
<i>When I already forgot about you,</i>

934
01:03:37.333 --> 01:03:38.625
<i>suddenly you're everywhere.</i>

935
01:03:39.541 --> 01:03:40.500
Who is that?

936
01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:42.375
It's Rosso, Grandma.

937
01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:44.166
But...

938
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:48.625
he changed his name to Ressa Eugino.

939
01:03:51.666 --> 01:03:53.625
<i>I saw you.</i>

940
01:03:53.708 --> 01:03:54.750
<i>I watched all of your shows.</i>

941
01:04:00.458 --> 01:04:02.791
There's something weird in my chest...

942
01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:05.500
everytime I see you.

943
01:04:08.666 --> 01:04:10.166
Grandma told me that...

944
01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:12.791
what I feel is love.

945
01:04:15.541 --> 01:04:17.250
<i>I even collected all of your articles...</i>

946
01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:20.666
<i>just because I loved you dearly.</i>

947
01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:24.875
<i>Chef, me and Nat are hearing some rumours.</i>

948
01:04:24.958 --> 01:04:25.875
<i>Many people say that...</i>

949
01:04:25.958 --> 01:04:28.583
<i>you dislike local food and spices.</i>

950
01:04:28.666 --> 01:04:29.500
<i>Is that true?</i>

951
01:04:29.583 --> 01:04:30.791
<i>As a chef,</i>

952
01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:32.333
<i>you're quite discriminating, aren't you?</i>

953
01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:34.125
<i>- Yeah, how come you do that
- No, it's not like that.</i>

954
01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:37.791
<i>My speciality is Italian food,</i>

955
01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:38.958
<i>which comes from my heritage.</i>

956
01:04:39.541 --> 01:04:42.166
<i>Anyway, for everyone at home,</i>

957
01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:43.500
<i>you may already know that...</i>

958
01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:46.625
<i>Chef Ressa was born in Jakarta.</i>

959
01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:47.541
<i>Right.</i>

960
01:04:47.625 --> 01:04:50.541
<i>But you were raised
in Italy with your father,</i>

961
01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:52.333
<i>- then you came back to Jakarta.
- That's right.</i>

962
01:04:52.416 --> 01:04:54.541
<i>- Until today?
- Yes, since then I've been staying here.</i>

963
01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:56.291
<i>Okay.</i>

964
01:04:56.375 --> 01:04:58.416
<i>I think I heard when...</i>

965
01:04:59.083 --> 01:05:02.125
Why did Rosso say that?

966
01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:04.375
I know Rosso very well,

967
01:05:05.166 --> 01:05:06.708
and I'm sure he's not the Rosso we know.

968
01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:09.750
<i>I felt the jealousy that I felt before,</i>

969
01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:12.166
<i>and it started to become hatred.</i>

970
01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:19.666
<i>Since then, I never
wanted to know you again.</i>

971
01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:21.791
<i>I erased you from my life.</i>

972
01:05:33.916 --> 01:05:35.208
I'm sorry, Tika.

973
01:06:24.875 --> 01:06:27.125
What happened?

974
01:06:27.208 --> 01:06:29.416
What happened with Maharasa?

975
01:06:31.166 --> 01:06:32.625
The food is unsatisfactory...

976
01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:34.416
yet it's overpriced, Sir.

977
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:39.791
But we use Mustika Rasa recipes!

978
01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:43.208
It is supposed to be
more than just satisfactory.

979
01:06:44.666 --> 01:06:46.208
This is not about Mustika Rasa, Sir.

980
01:06:46.291 --> 01:06:47.333
Then what's wrong?

981
01:06:48.625 --> 01:06:51.916
The food doesn't rely on the recipe, Sir.

982
01:06:52.916 --> 01:06:53.958
And?

983
01:06:54.041 --> 01:06:55.583
It relies on the Chef himself.

984
01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:58.166
What's wrong with our Chef?

985
01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.166
I think you should...

986
01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:04.083
take a closer look at the Chef.

987
01:07:10.958 --> 01:07:12.000
Dinda!

988
01:07:13.416 --> 01:07:14.375
Papa!

989
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:18.666
Go home,

990
01:07:19.291 --> 01:07:20.458
Now!

991
01:07:21.291 --> 01:07:22.250
Katherine.

992
01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:24.958
Drive her home.

993
01:07:34.875 --> 01:07:36.458
Mr. Broto.

994
01:07:36.541 --> 01:07:40.083
This is Mangut
developed from Chef Alex's recipe.

995
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:43.958
Sir, I'm the executive chef,

996
01:07:44.041 --> 01:07:47.000
I should be the one who cooks it.

997
01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:49.333
If you're the Executive Chef,

998
01:07:49.416 --> 01:07:51.291
you're supposed to be in the kitchen.

999
01:07:51.375 --> 01:07:53.083
Not in my office.

1000
01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:04.458
Now, I understand...

1001
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:06.166
why Maharasa is struggling.

1002
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:09.291
- Out!
- But, Sir, I think...

1003
01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:11.125
- Out!
- But, Sir! But, Sir!

1004
01:08:11.708 --> 01:08:12.625
Out!

1005
01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:19.166
Sorry to interrupt, Sir.

1006
01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.250
Please, take a look at this.

1007
01:08:21.333 --> 01:08:23.000
<i>Grandma Wongso's Restaurant is known as</i>

1008
01:08:23.083 --> 01:08:24.416
<i>the hotest place in Magelang.</i>

1009
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.666
<i>You guys must be familiar...</i>

1010
01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:27.666
<i>with this person, right?</i>

1011
01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:29.833
<i>Hello, good afternoon, Chef.</i>

1012
01:08:29.916 --> 01:08:30.916
<i>Hello.</i>

1013
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.583
<i>We're very curious, Chef. Why exactly...</i>

1014
01:08:32.666 --> 01:08:34.333
- Ressa?
- <i>are you here?</i>

1015
01:08:34.416 --> 01:08:35.875
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>

1016
01:08:35.958 --> 01:08:38.041
<i>I've been lying for a long time.</i>

1017
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:41.291
<i>I've told everyone
that I was born in Jakarta,</i>

1018
01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:42.916
<i>but it's not true.</i>

1019
01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.750
<i>I was born in this village,</i>

1020
01:08:46.375 --> 01:08:49.000
<i>and I was raised by Grandma Wongso...</i>

1021
01:08:49.583 --> 01:08:51.541
<i>until I was eight years old.</i>

1022
01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:54.583
<i>Then I moved to
Jakarta when I was adopted.</i>

1023
01:08:55.416 --> 01:08:57.541
<i>But now, I'm back...</i>

1024
01:08:58.333 --> 01:08:59.958
<i>and would like to dedicate myself here.</i>

1025
01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:01.291
So, I can...

1026
01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:02.833
help Tika...

1027
01:09:02.916 --> 01:09:04.833
and Grandma Wongso.

1028
01:09:04.916 --> 01:09:07.250
Okay. Alright, Tika,
could you please tell us...

1029
01:09:07.333 --> 01:09:09.708
where did you get
the recipes for the menu?

1030
01:09:09.791 --> 01:09:11.875
Actually...

1031
01:09:11.958 --> 01:09:14.708
All the recipes are Grandma Wongso's,

1032
01:09:14.791 --> 01:09:18.125
since she collected many recipes...

1033
01:09:18.208 --> 01:09:19.041
from Indonesia.

1034
01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:21.791
<i>Which makes us drool, right?</i>

1035
01:09:21.875 --> 01:09:22.708
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

1036
01:09:52.541 --> 01:09:54.041
Grandma.

1037
01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.166
Try this one.

1038
01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:58.208
Okay.

1039
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:07.916
Is it nice?

1040
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.250
How is it?

1041
01:10:09.333 --> 01:10:10.666
Of course it is.

1042
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:13.958
But my tongue
can't eat this type of noodle.

1043
01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:16.291
I would love to...

1044
01:10:16.375 --> 01:10:18.916
add spices that were made by your Grandpa.

1045
01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:21.375
I could make you a new one,

1046
01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:22.333
if you want.

1047
01:10:22.416 --> 01:10:23.500
Do you want it too?

1048
01:10:23.583 --> 01:10:25.375
There's no need.

1049
01:10:25.458 --> 01:10:29.916
I'm happy to see you both get along.

1050
01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:32.166
You know...

1051
01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:35.000
A week ago, your Grandpa...

1052
01:10:35.083 --> 01:10:36.166
came to my dream.

1053
01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:39.083
- Grandpa Darsono?
- Yes.

1054
01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:41.166
Your Grandpa asked...

1055
01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:43.291
why did I...

1056
01:10:43.375 --> 01:10:46.458
I forget and leave Rosso behind.

1057
01:10:47.125 --> 01:10:48.458
Forget about me?

1058
01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:52.625
How come he knows Rosso?

1059
01:10:52.708 --> 01:10:55.458
That's what I thought.

1060
01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:58.000
Because of that,

1061
01:10:58.083 --> 01:11:00.000
I fell near the well.

1062
01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:05.166
No need to think about it.

1063
01:11:05.791 --> 01:11:07.208
Let's go, come with me.

1064
01:11:07.833 --> 01:11:10.291
I will finish it later.

1065
01:11:11.583 --> 01:11:12.708
Where are we going?

1066
01:11:12.791 --> 01:11:13.791
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1067
01:11:16.083 --> 01:11:17.083
Let me help you.

1068
01:11:33.375 --> 01:11:34.291
Be careful, Grandma.

1069
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.000
Isn't this...

1070
01:11:38.916 --> 01:11:40.416
Isn't this the road to Alas Kiwo?

1071
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.458
The haunted forest, right?

1072
01:12:05.958 --> 01:12:08.666
Your Grandpa Darsono
was buried here, Tika.

1073
01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:14.333
He was buried
along with the other victims.

1074
01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:18.791
They were accused of being communist...

1075
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:21.875
that's why they were brutally murdered.

1076
01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:29.041
That's why this place is
called Alas Kiwo, "The left hill".

1077
01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:32.541
The hill where...

1078
01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:35.708
people from the left-wing are buried.

1079
01:12:37.833 --> 01:12:39.083
So,

1080
01:12:39.166 --> 01:12:41.958
this place is really haunted?

1081
01:12:42.041 --> 01:12:44.291
They deliberately said...

1082
01:12:44.375 --> 01:12:46.333
that this forest was haunted.

1083
01:12:46.416 --> 01:12:49.666
So, no one comes
here to pray for their family.

1084
01:12:51.625 --> 01:12:53.500
Your Grandpa was
accused of being a communist...

1085
01:12:53.583 --> 01:12:56.791
by people who hated him.

1086
01:12:57.458 --> 01:12:58.708
That's cruel.

1087
01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.583
That's what happens...

1088
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.666
when you're too fanatic
with political parties.

1089
01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:10.250
Innocent people become victims.

1090
01:13:12.666 --> 01:13:14.208
But, why did...

1091
01:13:14.291 --> 01:13:16.583
Grandpa Darsono call me in your dream?

1092
01:13:17.416 --> 01:13:19.750
He wants to

1093
01:13:19.833 --> 01:13:21.458
give you and Tika something.

1094
01:13:23.458 --> 01:13:25.041
What is it?

1095
01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:30.958
A very confidential and important thing
that mustn't fall into anyone's hands.

1096
01:13:38.416 --> 01:13:41.666
<i>One day, we had guests in our house.</i>

1097
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.791
<i>They said the President sent them.</i>

1098
01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:45.750
Darsono, - I'm Major Bonar.

1099
01:13:46.333 --> 01:13:47.500
Captain Atmo.

1100
01:13:47.583 --> 01:13:48.666
Darsono.

1101
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:49.583
Lieutnant Ismet.

1102
01:13:49.666 --> 01:13:50.500
Darsono.

1103
01:13:50.583 --> 01:13:52.333
We're here because...

1104
01:13:52.416 --> 01:13:53.333
Here, Sir.

1105
01:13:55.708 --> 01:13:57.166
STATEMENT LETTER

1106
01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:58.833
Mr. President appointed you.

1107
01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:04.166
- Please, have a bite.
- This is it.

1108
01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:08.291
Thank you.

1109
01:14:09.791 --> 01:14:10.916
Please, dig in.

1110
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:14.500
<i>While eating Mangut,</i>

1111
01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:18.708
<i>they asked
your Grandpa to join their project.</i>

1112
01:14:18.791 --> 01:14:20.875
You use your own technique to cook this!

1113
01:14:20.958 --> 01:14:23.791
No, I didn't. I cook like everyone else.

1114
01:14:23.875 --> 01:14:26.875
I understand why Mr. President chose you.

1115
01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:29.833
<i>Along with 17 culturalists</i>

1116
01:14:29.916 --> 01:14:32.708
<i>and eight soldiers,</i>

1117
01:14:34.083 --> 01:14:36.583
<i>your Grandpa went to see Mr. President,</i>

1118
01:14:36.666 --> 01:14:38.500
<i>and he ordered them to...</i>

1119
01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:43.250
<i>collect 1945 food recipes...</i>

1120
01:14:43.333 --> 01:14:48.875
<i>from every city in Indonesia.</i>

1121
01:14:48.958 --> 01:14:52.000
<i>And that document is called Mustika Rasa</i>

1122
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.500
Tujuh belas Culturalists,

1123
01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:00.041
eight soldiers,

1124
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:04.041
1945 recipes.

1125
01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:05.958
Our independence day.

1126
01:15:06.708 --> 01:15:09.541
That's why Mustika Rasa...

1127
01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:12.083
became an important project
that everyone protected.

1128
01:15:12.166 --> 01:15:15.708
What about the other 945 recipes?

1129
01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:18.375
That year, there was
an uproar in our country,

1130
01:15:18.458 --> 01:15:21.875
thus, they haven't been recorded yet.

1131
01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:27.250
<i>On 30 September 1965 in the morning,</i>

1132
01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:30.291
<i>there was a coup in Lubang Buaya...</i>

1133
01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:32.083
<i>that was planned by the Communist Parties...</i>

1134
01:15:32.166 --> 01:15:36.708
<i>which resulted in
seven high-ranking soldiers dying.</i>

1135
01:15:37.416 --> 01:15:42.041
<i>Since then, the members of
communist parties and those related,</i>

1136
01:15:42.125 --> 01:15:43.583
<i>were captured and murdered.</i>

1137
01:15:43.666 --> 01:15:45.875
Put it quickly. Leave it.

1138
01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:46.916
You should save yourself.

1139
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:47.958
Alright, Sir.

1140
01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.375
Where are you going Ismet?

1141
01:15:56.541 --> 01:15:58.583
Don't you dare take Mustika Rasa...

1142
01:15:58.666 --> 01:16:00.500
out of this office.

1143
01:16:02.708 --> 01:16:04.500
Our country is in jeopardy.

1144
01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:05.875
You have to save yourself.

1145
01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:08.208
This is the key to our house.

1146
01:16:08.291 --> 01:16:09.333
There's a safe at the back of the house...

1147
01:16:09.416 --> 01:16:11.541
where I put all of our country's
confidential documents.

1148
01:16:11.625 --> 01:16:13.458
It's in the spices warehouse.

1149
01:16:13.541 --> 01:16:15.291
Protect these documents for me,

1150
01:16:15.375 --> 01:16:17.375
and never give it to anyone.

1151
01:16:18.125 --> 01:16:19.541
I can entrust this to no one but you.

1152
01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:21.166
After Ketut Arsa arrives,

1153
01:16:22.166 --> 01:16:24.041
we will follow you.

1154
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.458
<i>That day was the last
time I saw your Grandpa.</i>

1155
01:16:33.541 --> 01:16:35.208
<i>Not long after,</i>

1156
01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:36.583
<i>I heard that...</i>

1157
01:16:36.666 --> 01:16:40.250
<i>your Grandpa was killed in Alas Kiwo.</i>

1158
01:16:44.375 --> 01:16:45.833
This warehouse

1159
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.375
used to be Japan's weapons warehouse.

1160
01:16:50.458 --> 01:16:53.375
Then your Grandpa...

1161
01:16:53.458 --> 01:16:55.458
turned it into his office.

1162
01:16:56.125 --> 01:16:57.041
And then?

1163
01:17:11.208 --> 01:17:12.416
Come in.

1164
01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:24.625
Be careful, it's quite dark in here.

1165
01:17:24.708 --> 01:17:27.000
Let me turn on the lamp.

1166
01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:32.583
Careful, Grandma.

1167
01:17:38.333 --> 01:17:39.458
Come here.

1168
01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.375
Here it is. Take out
that briefcase under the table.

1169
01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:48.416
Here it is.

1170
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.791
INDEPENDENCE!

1171
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:01.625
This is the rest of
Mustika Rasa's recipes.

1172
01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:02.625
Let me see.

1173
01:18:11.375 --> 01:18:13.416
Both of you have to look after it.

1174
01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:16.416
Why does it have to be both of us?

1175
01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:21.041
Because both of you
are the inheritors of Mustika Rasa.

1176
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:26.750
But I'm not
Grandpa Darsono's descendant, like Tika.

1177
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:28.958
Here.

1178
01:18:31.375 --> 01:18:32.541
The man in the middle was...

1179
01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:36.958
Ketut Arsa.

1180
01:18:37.708 --> 01:18:39.875
<i>He was my husband's best friend,</i>

1181
01:18:39.958 --> 01:18:43.750
<i>a gastronome and a Chef.</i>

1182
01:18:44.375 --> 01:18:46.041
He was your biological Grandpa.

1183
01:18:46.916 --> 01:18:49.833
There is his blood in you.

1184
01:18:49.916 --> 01:18:51.875
That's why it didn't surprise me...

1185
01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:54.166
when you become a wonderful chef.

1186
01:18:54.791 --> 01:18:58.125
He had the same fate as Grandpa Darsono.

1187
01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:01.708
He was killed
and left two daughters behind.

1188
01:19:02.291 --> 01:19:04.166
And one of them is your mom.

1189
01:19:05.125 --> 01:19:06.083
Grandma.

1190
01:19:06.166 --> 01:19:08.833
Are these the 17
Mustika Rasa culturalists?

1191
01:19:08.916 --> 01:19:10.333
Is this him, Grandma?

1192
01:19:10.416 --> 01:19:11.750
Along with Ir. Soekarno?

1193
01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.000
Deep down I know my
mother didn't abandon me.

1194
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.208
Your mom is Tika's mother's best friend,

1195
01:19:25.916 --> 01:19:28.791
so, I know her.

1196
01:19:29.375 --> 01:19:30.208
Grandma.

1197
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:31.875
Is this my mother?

1198
01:19:31.958 --> 01:19:33.125
That's right.

1199
01:19:33.208 --> 01:19:35.125
This is your mom,

1200
01:19:35.208 --> 01:19:37.625
and this is Evi, Rosso's mother.

1201
01:19:54.291 --> 01:19:55.875
She looks like my adopted mother, Eva.

1202
01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.791
Many people mistake them for twins.

1203
01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:00.833
Evi is like your Grandpa,

1204
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:05.750
she has strong principles.

1205
01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:08.875
Where are they now?

1206
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:13.583
They are on the missing people list.

1207
01:20:15.541 --> 01:20:16.375
LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO GET ABDUCTED!

1208
01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:17.291
THE REASONS FOR
THE CLOSURE OF PRODUCTION ARE NAMED!

1209
01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:18.208
IS THIS RELATED TO
THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE COMPANY?

1210
01:20:18.291 --> 01:20:19.708
<i>Until today,</i>

1211
01:20:19.791 --> 01:20:21.000
<i>we don't know where they are.</i>

1212
01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:21.916
THE MISSING PEOPLE.

1213
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.583
THE MERGER OF TWO WORLD UNIVERSITIES
WAS SUCCESSFUL. THIS IS A NEW ROUND.

1214
01:20:23.666 --> 01:20:25.833
<i>Without me realizing it...</i>

1215
01:20:25.916 --> 01:20:31.166
<i>I lost Ratih because of
Jakarta's political situation.</i>

1216
01:20:40.416 --> 01:20:41.375
<i>Mother...</i>

1217
01:20:41.458 --> 01:20:43.750
<i>We're in danger.</i>

1218
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:46.250
<i>I need to run and hide.</i>

1219
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.916
<i>Please take care of Tika.</i>

1220
01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:51.958
<i>I'll pick her up</i>

1221
01:20:52.041 --> 01:20:54.166
<i>once the situation is safe.</i>

1222
01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:56.666
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1223
01:21:00.625 --> 01:21:02.708
<i>Two days later,</i>

1224
01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:07.125
<i>Evi gave you to Grandpa Darmo.</i>

1225
01:21:07.208 --> 01:21:10.000
<i>She followed Ratih.</i>

1226
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:14.458
<i>She said that...</i>

1227
01:21:14.541 --> 01:21:17.000
<i>later on, either she or her sister...</i>

1228
01:21:17.083 --> 01:21:20.083
<i>will pick Rosso up.</i>

1229
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:31.291
Please take care of this legacy.

1230
01:21:33.291 --> 01:21:35.750
Never hand this to other people.

1231
01:21:39.458 --> 01:21:44.500
Especially these two soldiers.

1232
01:22:08.541 --> 01:22:11.083
This is a stress ball from my doctor.

1233
01:22:14.333 --> 01:22:16.375
My stress-reliever.

1234
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.166
I didn't expect that...

1235
01:22:22.416 --> 01:22:24.166
my healing would be like this.

1236
01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:27.916
At least,

1237
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:31.583
now you know where you come from.

1238
01:22:32.208 --> 01:22:33.708
My taste buds are healed.

1239
01:22:34.708 --> 01:22:36.916
I've overcome my trauma.

1240
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:41.291
But the most important thing,

1241
01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:44.791
I have my friend back.

1242
01:22:53.291 --> 01:22:55.708
So, you don't need these now?

1243
01:23:18.083 --> 01:23:19.458
And what's next?

1244
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.666
I don't know.

1245
01:23:27.916 --> 01:23:31.000
You wouldn't be here if
you hadn't lost your taste buds.

1246
01:23:32.958 --> 01:23:33.916
That's true.

1247
01:23:35.541 --> 01:23:37.708
Successfully ran my food test...

1248
01:23:37.791 --> 01:23:41.291
and had a restaurant in Gragnano.

1249
01:23:43.833 --> 01:23:45.708
Why don't you do it now?

1250
01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:50.125
Actually, that's my father's dream.

1251
01:23:50.791 --> 01:23:52.041
It's his childhood dream...

1252
01:23:52.125 --> 01:23:53.833
to have a restaurant in his hometown.

1253
01:23:55.041 --> 01:23:57.333
When he died,

1254
01:24:00.458 --> 01:24:02.416
I promised him...

1255
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.791
I'd make his dream come true.

1256
01:24:05.875 --> 01:24:06.791
That's how it is.

1257
01:24:08.458 --> 01:24:09.583
You can make it happen.

1258
01:24:11.041 --> 01:24:12.791
I'm sure of it.

1259
01:24:13.375 --> 01:24:14.916
It's not that easy.

1260
01:24:17.125 --> 01:24:19.416
Now I know who I am.

1261
01:24:20.708 --> 01:24:23.833
Who my parents are, my Grandpa.

1262
01:24:27.375 --> 01:24:28.916
Your life is not here, Rosso.

1263
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.083
I couldn't leave you behind,

1264
01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:32.583
especially with that huge bequest!

1265
01:24:35.916 --> 01:24:38.708
It shouldn't be
your concern, don't you think?

1266
01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:43.666
How can I possibly carry out
my Father's dream in peace?

1267
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:45.333
How can I?

1268
01:24:45.416 --> 01:24:46.250
It won't be possible, unless...

1269
01:24:46.333 --> 01:24:48.291
Unless I accompany you?

1270
01:24:50.541 --> 01:24:51.541
I can't do that.

1271
01:24:52.833 --> 01:24:54.125
- Now way. I can't do that.
- Tika.

1272
01:24:54.208 --> 01:24:55.291
Why?

1273
01:24:55.916 --> 01:24:57.000
Why can't you?

1274
01:24:58.708 --> 01:25:00.333
Can't you see it?

1275
01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:02.916
My life is here.

1276
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:06.500
I can't leave Grandma behind.

1277
01:25:06.583 --> 01:25:08.458
- I didn't ask you to leave her.
- Then?

1278
01:25:10.375 --> 01:25:11.208
Then what?

1279
01:25:11.291 --> 01:25:13.041
- Maybe I'll move...
- No.

1280
01:25:14.125 --> 01:25:15.375
You'll move?

1281
01:25:15.458 --> 01:25:17.083
You'll move here permanently?

1282
01:25:19.791 --> 01:25:20.833
Don't be ridiculous!

1283
01:25:22.583 --> 01:25:24.208
Is it wrong that I wanna stay with you?

1284
01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:30.625
I will leave everything behind.

1285
01:25:36.458 --> 01:25:37.708
You're the one who said it.

1286
01:25:41.125 --> 01:25:42.166
You said it is love.

1287
01:26:00.333 --> 01:26:01.458
Yes, Gareng?

1288
01:26:03.541 --> 01:26:04.500
What?

1289
01:26:06.125 --> 01:26:07.083
By whom?

1290
01:26:23.166 --> 01:26:24.875
They seem scary.

1291
01:26:26.166 --> 01:26:27.041
Sis.

1292
01:26:29.541 --> 01:26:33.000
Tarjo forced us to
open because there's a VIP.

1293
01:26:33.083 --> 01:26:34.375
Who are they?

1294
01:26:34.458 --> 01:26:36.791
I don't know, I've never seen them.

1295
01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:54.583
Mr. Broto.

1296
01:26:56.541 --> 01:26:57.916
Ressa!

1297
01:26:58.791 --> 01:27:00.708
Where have you been?

1298
01:27:01.875 --> 01:27:04.208
I've been waiting for the food tasting

1299
01:27:04.291 --> 01:27:06.875
but you're nowhere to be seen.

1300
01:27:08.875 --> 01:27:11.791
How could you know that I'm here?

1301
01:27:14.708 --> 01:27:16.916
This restaurant...

1302
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.083
went viral.

1303
01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:23.916
The show is talking about your specialty.

1304
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.291
Mangut.

1305
01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:28.583
I see you there, and here I am.

1306
01:27:28.666 --> 01:27:32.125
So, if it possible...

1307
01:27:32.208 --> 01:27:36.875
can I try the Mangut?

1308
01:27:38.708 --> 01:27:40.125
I apologize in advance.

1309
01:27:40.958 --> 01:27:42.166
I'm Tika.

1310
01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:45.375
Subroto, you can call me Broto.

1311
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.166
Our restaurant is closed for today,

1312
01:27:51.250 --> 01:27:52.625
you can come back tomorrow.

1313
01:27:52.708 --> 01:27:55.708
I'll pay extra...

1314
01:27:55.791 --> 01:28:00.708
so you can buy
all the ingredients that you need.

1315
01:28:01.291 --> 01:28:02.250
Here's the money.

1316
01:28:02.333 --> 01:28:03.583
Please take it.

1317
01:28:04.166 --> 01:28:05.666
So, can I try the Mangut?

1318
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.375
Sir, this is not about the money...

1319
01:28:08.458 --> 01:28:11.083
We have all the ingredients,

1320
01:28:11.833 --> 01:28:13.166
we will cook it for you.

1321
01:28:13.875 --> 01:28:17.041
- You have all the ingredients, right?
- Yes, we do have it all.

1322
01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:18.708
Come on Tika, let's cook.

1323
01:28:19.416 --> 01:28:20.583
Miss.

1324
01:28:20.666 --> 01:28:22.625
Please...

1325
01:28:22.708 --> 01:28:25.000
cook the Mangut for me.

1326
01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:26.125
Please?

1327
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:36.958
We got a lot of money, Gareng.

1328
01:28:37.041 --> 01:28:38.250
Careful.

1329
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.583
How much will I get?

1330
01:28:40.666 --> 01:28:41.708
I'll give you ten percent as usual.

1331
01:28:41.791 --> 01:28:43.041
Eleven percent.

1332
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:44.666
I'll give you 15%.

1333
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:45.666
That's good!

1334
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:46.666
Let's start cooking!

1335
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:48.000
Only think about money.

1336
01:28:49.083 --> 01:28:50.708
- Help me, Sister!
- What is it?

1337
01:28:50.791 --> 01:28:52.500
- The catfish!
- Okay, I'll help you.

1338
01:28:55.375 --> 01:28:56.625
I'd like to...

1339
01:28:56.708 --> 01:28:58.291
apologize...

1340
01:28:58.375 --> 01:29:01.333
on behalf of my daughter.

1341
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.208
And as I offer my apologies,

1342
01:29:07.291 --> 01:29:10.750
I'll help you and invest...

1343
01:29:10.833 --> 01:29:14.208
in your restaurant in Italy.

1344
01:29:16.875 --> 01:29:19.500
You can tell me,

1345
01:29:19.583 --> 01:29:22.500
when and where you wanna build it.

1346
01:29:23.083 --> 01:29:25.166
We will build it together.

1347
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:26.166
Okay?

1348
01:29:26.708 --> 01:29:28.208
May I think about it first?

1349
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
The smell is very appetizing.

1350
01:29:51.833 --> 01:29:54.208
Give me the plate.

1351
01:30:02.416 --> 01:30:04.333
Let's eat!

1352
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:15.000
Woah!

1353
01:30:15.083 --> 01:30:17.166
This is so delicious!

1354
01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:22.375
The last time I at this
kind of incredible Mangut...

1355
01:30:22.458 --> 01:30:24.875
was 55 years ago.

1356
01:30:24.958 --> 01:30:28.583
Even my tongue
couldn't forget the taste of it.

1357
01:30:29.166 --> 01:30:30.916
I might be wrong but...

1358
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.875
you cook...

1359
01:30:34.958 --> 01:30:37.625
the Mangut by...

1360
01:30:37.708 --> 01:30:40.750
curing the fish with candlenut wood.

1361
01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:44.750
Do you know about curing
the fish with candlenut wood?

1362
01:30:44.833 --> 01:30:46.166
Of course, I know.

1363
01:30:46.875 --> 01:30:48.500
Aren't I amazing?

1364
01:30:48.583 --> 01:30:51.000
You're incredible, Tika.

1365
01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:53.916
The cooking technique

1366
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.833
that you're using is very unique.

1367
01:30:55.916 --> 01:30:58.875
Everyone should
know the special food that...

1368
01:30:58.958 --> 01:31:00.583
is made by this unique technique.

1369
01:31:00.666 --> 01:31:03.750
So, if you want to expand this restaurant,

1370
01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:05.541
please, do not hesitate...

1371
01:31:05.625 --> 01:31:07.166
to call me.

1372
01:31:08.125 --> 01:31:11.208
Give me that. Here is my name card.

1373
01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:12.916
Here.

1374
01:31:14.875 --> 01:31:17.250
Your restaurant is very special...

1375
01:31:17.333 --> 01:31:23.666
and every person in Indonesia has to know.

1376
01:31:27.958 --> 01:31:31.083
PRESIDENTIAL SPECIAL STAFF

1377
01:31:32.958 --> 01:31:36.000
Mr. Broto knows about
curing with candlenut wood.

1378
01:31:36.083 --> 01:31:38.083
How come he knows that?

1379
01:31:38.166 --> 01:31:39.916
He's one of the President's advisors,

1380
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.333
who's concerned about Indonesian food.

1381
01:31:42.416 --> 01:31:44.750
It's a no-brainer
that he knows a lot about that.

1382
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.541
My Grandpa made that curing method...

1383
01:31:46.625 --> 01:31:49.583
only for the family.

1384
01:31:49.666 --> 01:31:50.958
There's no way he knows that.

1385
01:31:56.791 --> 01:31:59.250
I'm sure he knows my Grandpa.

1386
01:32:01.791 --> 01:32:03.250
What if...

1387
01:32:03.333 --> 01:32:05.916
he is one of the soldiers in that photo?

1388
01:32:09.333 --> 01:32:10.291
Let's see.

1389
01:32:16.416 --> 01:32:17.583
No one resembles him,

1390
01:32:18.083 --> 01:32:19.083
I don't think he was one of them.

1391
01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:20.125
Here, you can check it thoroughly.

1392
01:32:21.291 --> 01:32:22.375
I will drive.

1393
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.500
We need to talk to
Grandma about Mr. Broto.

1394
01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:35.416
I'll go home first.

1395
01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.041
Okay, be careful.

1396
01:32:49.916 --> 01:32:51.291
May peace be upon you.

1397
01:32:51.958 --> 01:32:53.125
Grandma?

1398
01:32:53.208 --> 01:32:54.166
Grandma!

1399
01:32:54.250 --> 01:32:59.791
Grandma!

1400
01:33:05.541 --> 01:33:07.916
Mrs. Sunarti suffered
from anoxia brain injury...

1401
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.458
because of
the lack of oxygen in her brain.

1402
01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:13.000
This can occur in situations like stroke,

1403
01:33:13.083 --> 01:33:14.500
traumatic incident,

1404
01:33:14.583 --> 01:33:16.416
choking out or overdose.

1405
01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:18.666
We'll try our best.

1406
01:33:20.333 --> 01:33:21.375
Thank you.

1407
01:33:38.083 --> 01:33:39.041
Grandma.

1408
01:33:40.875 --> 01:33:42.125
Please wake up, Grandma.

1409
01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:47.625
Let's eat the spaghetti
that Rosso made again.

1410
01:33:52.333 --> 01:33:53.583
Let's...

1411
01:33:54.708 --> 01:33:57.250
visit Grandpa Darsono's
grave together again.

1412
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:12.000
I have a lot of
questions regarding Mustika Rasa.

1413
01:34:14.125 --> 01:34:15.625
You have to answer them all.

1414
01:34:22.541 --> 01:34:23.958
Grandma, please wake up.

1415
01:34:45.625 --> 01:34:47.666
So, your Grandma already...

1416
01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.958
told you about the recipe documents?

1417
01:35:03.458 --> 01:35:05.125
Why can't you...

1418
01:35:05.208 --> 01:35:06.666
give that up?

1419
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:09.250
Those cursed documents...

1420
01:35:09.333 --> 01:35:11.208
already have...

1421
01:35:11.291 --> 01:35:12.250
many casualties.

1422
01:35:12.833 --> 01:35:14.583
Why did you say that, Grandpa?

1423
01:35:19.833 --> 01:35:22.416
Mustika Rasa is a curse, Tika.

1424
01:35:23.083 --> 01:35:24.708
It is a curse for my family,

1425
01:35:24.791 --> 01:35:26.500
my brother,

1426
01:35:26.583 --> 01:35:28.916
your Grandma and her kids.

1427
01:35:29.625 --> 01:35:30.916
Including your mother.

1428
01:35:31.708 --> 01:35:33.625
Everyone becomes the victims.

1429
01:35:33.708 --> 01:35:36.958
The first time
I heard about Mustika Rasa...

1430
01:35:37.041 --> 01:35:40.000
a project that my brother was proud of,

1431
01:35:40.583 --> 01:35:42.791
I was only 12 years old.

1432
01:35:45.125 --> 01:35:48.000
<i>Darsono and your Grandpa, Ketut Arsa...</i>

1433
01:35:48.083 --> 01:35:50.583
<i>were talking very seriously.</i>

1434
01:35:50.666 --> 01:35:54.500
<i>The President asked them
to hide several numbers that...</i>

1435
01:35:54.583 --> 01:35:57.833
<i>I didn't know what it was for.</i>

1436
01:35:58.500 --> 01:35:59.791
<i>But, it turns out...</i>

1437
01:35:59.875 --> 01:36:03.541
<i>that those numbers are
coordinates of a treasure location</i>

1438
01:36:03.625 --> 01:36:08.208
<i>that is hidden randomly on</i>

1439
01:36:08.291 --> 01:36:09.958
<i>the rest of the 945 pages of Mustika Rasa.</i>

1440
01:36:10.041 --> 01:36:10.875
<i>Your Grandpa, Ressa,</i>

1441
01:36:11.625 --> 01:36:14.166
<i>he wasn't sure about this action,</i>

1442
01:36:14.250 --> 01:36:18.125
<i>he thinks that those numbers
should be placed in a safer place.</i>

1443
01:36:18.708 --> 01:36:20.791
<i>But my brother, Darsono, said that</i>

1444
01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:23.541
<i>there will be turmoil on the military base.</i>

1445
01:36:23.625 --> 01:36:26.375
<i>Thus, these maps should
be put in unexpected places.</i>

1446
01:36:26.458 --> 01:36:28.333
This is a conspiracy, Darsono.

1447
01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:31.291
This is a duty from our country, Ketut.

1448
01:36:31.375 --> 01:36:32.958
<i>A treasure map?</i>

1449
01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:35.125
<i>That's right.</i>

1450
01:36:35.208 --> 01:36:38.250
<i>The location of
the biggest mine in the world.</i>

1451
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:46.625
<i>Bigger than the gold mine
in Mimika, Central Papua.</i>

1452
01:36:46.708 --> 01:36:49.958
<i>If we're talking about
the value, how much would it be?</i>

1453
01:36:50.041 --> 01:36:53.000
<i>If the gold mine was found,</i>

1454
01:36:53.083 --> 01:36:56.416
<i>Indonesia would be
the richest country in the world.</i>

1455
01:36:59.583 --> 01:37:01.708
That's why everyone
is looking for that document.

1456
01:37:01.791 --> 01:37:05.000
People who have those documents...

1457
01:37:05.083 --> 01:37:07.208
will get cursed, including both of you.

1458
01:37:13.833 --> 01:37:15.541
Then, what should we do?

1459
01:37:16.166 --> 01:37:17.458
I think...

1460
01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:19.750
just give it back to the government.

1461
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.625
I heard that General Subroto
came to your restaurant.

1462
01:37:24.708 --> 01:37:27.208
You could give it to him,

1463
01:37:28.333 --> 01:37:29.958
as he's one of the President's advisors.

1464
01:37:31.208 --> 01:37:32.166
That's true.

1465
01:37:32.958 --> 01:37:34.916
I think we should give him the documents.
Don't you agree?

1466
01:37:38.833 --> 01:37:39.750
No.

1467
01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.833
I can't make a decision...

1468
01:37:42.916 --> 01:37:44.708
before discussing it with Grandma first.

1469
01:37:45.583 --> 01:37:49.000
Look at your Grandma's condition, Tika.

1470
01:38:05.333 --> 01:38:06.333
- Let's eat first.
- Yes.

1471
01:38:19.791 --> 01:38:20.750
Delicious.

1472
01:38:23.833 --> 01:38:25.125
In my opinion,

1473
01:38:26.625 --> 01:38:28.833
only the government has
the right to keep the document.

1474
01:38:30.916 --> 01:38:32.416
The responsibility is too extensive,

1475
01:38:33.416 --> 01:38:34.583
don't you think so?

1476
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.125
But,

1477
01:38:40.958 --> 01:38:43.625
if it's that massive...

1478
01:38:45.833 --> 01:38:48.208
why did the President
entrust it to Grandpa?

1479
01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:52.708
Why didn't he give it to Bonar or Atmo?

1480
01:39:09.958 --> 01:39:10.958
Rosso!

1481
01:39:36.666 --> 01:39:37.583
Dinda.

1482
01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:40.500
I... I didn't come here
because Papa asked me to.

1483
01:39:43.833 --> 01:39:45.666
Can we go inside to talk?

1484
01:39:50.458 --> 01:39:51.708
Rosso.

1485
01:39:51.791 --> 01:39:53.500
I'll go to the kitchen for a bit.

1486
01:40:06.416 --> 01:40:08.625
I'm here to prevent
things before it's too late.

1487
01:40:10.208 --> 01:40:12.250
You're a good man, Ressa.

1488
01:40:15.166 --> 01:40:17.833
I now realize that I was stupid

1489
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:23.708
and got fooled by Papa and Alex.

1490
01:40:23.791 --> 01:40:26.458
If you're here
because of that incident, I'm alr...

1491
01:40:26.541 --> 01:40:28.916
Please, listen to me first, Ressa.

1492
01:40:29.625 --> 01:40:30.583
Alright.

1493
01:40:34.541 --> 01:40:36.666
Papa already planned this.

1494
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:38.208
Alex and I were having an affair,

1495
01:40:38.291 --> 01:40:41.875
but I never gave him an access card.

1496
01:40:43.875 --> 01:40:45.625
Papa is the one who gave it to him.

1497
01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:48.375
Dinda...

1498
01:40:50.291 --> 01:40:52.208
It's enough, Din. Please.

1499
01:40:54.083 --> 01:40:55.875
I'm sorry Ressa.

1500
01:41:00.416 --> 01:41:03.416
Please, stop having contact with my Dad.

1501
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:07.833
What do you mean?

1502
01:41:07.916 --> 01:41:10.083
Papa must have tried to convince you...

1503
01:41:10.166 --> 01:41:12.291
about the restaurant in Gragnano, right?

1504
01:41:13.041 --> 01:41:16.583
He also offered Tika
to expand her restaurant.

1505
01:41:17.583 --> 01:41:20.166
It is all his ploy, Ressa.

1506
01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:24.916
A ploy to snatch Mustika Rasa
from you and Tika.

1507
01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:30.666
How do you know about Mustika Rasa?

1508
01:41:32.583 --> 01:41:35.000
Papa is obsessed with Mustika Rasa.

1509
01:41:35.083 --> 01:41:37.125
I heard that...

1510
01:41:37.208 --> 01:41:39.375
the President...

1511
01:41:39.458 --> 01:41:42.000
is banning the import of rice.

1512
01:41:42.875 --> 01:41:46.208
That policy is interrupting our business.

1513
01:41:47.291 --> 01:41:49.416
Finding...

1514
01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:54.833
the rest of Mustika Rasa is our only way.

1515
01:41:54.916 --> 01:41:56.916
Because inside those documents,

1516
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.125
there's a treasure map...

1517
01:42:00.208 --> 01:42:04.250
that is worth an incalculable amount.

1518
01:42:04.333 --> 01:42:05.250
Understand?

1519
01:42:05.333 --> 01:42:06.250
Yes, Sir.

1520
01:42:06.833 --> 01:42:08.000
We'll look for it.

1521
01:42:09.458 --> 01:42:11.791
Papa knows both of you are related

1522
01:42:11.875 --> 01:42:13.375
to Mustika Rasa because of your Mangut.

1523
01:42:13.458 --> 01:42:15.291
Who's your father?

1524
01:42:16.458 --> 01:42:17.666
He's Major Bonar,

1525
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:18.666
isn't he?

1526
01:42:21.833 --> 01:42:22.833
He's not.

1527
01:42:23.958 --> 01:42:26.250
I'm Captain Atmojo.

1528
01:42:27.583 --> 01:42:30.833
Subroto Sastro Atmojo.

1529
01:42:31.416 --> 01:42:33.041
Then, I changed it into...

1530
01:42:33.125 --> 01:42:35.375
Subroto Mangku Projo.

1531
01:42:35.458 --> 01:42:38.125
That's the name
you're familiar with, right?

1532
01:42:38.208 --> 01:42:40.041
Don't you dare...

1533
01:42:40.125 --> 01:42:41.666
bring Mustika Rasa out of this office.

1534
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:48.666
Ismet.

1535
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:50.416
Hurry up! We have to go out now.

1536
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.625
- What about the money, Sir?
- It's in the car.

1537
01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:54.250
- Quick.
- Alright, Sir.

1538
01:43:06.166 --> 01:43:07.500
Bastard!

1539
01:43:10.333 --> 01:43:11.708
Where's the rest?

1540
01:43:14.416 --> 01:43:16.041
Darsono, you bastard!

1541
01:43:16.875 --> 01:43:18.041
Papa!

1542
01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:20.791
Thank you Dinda...

1543
01:43:20.875 --> 01:43:22.458
for doing your part very well.

1544
01:43:22.541 --> 01:43:25.333
You said you're not here
because your Papa asked you.

1545
01:43:25.416 --> 01:43:26.750
I'm not!

1546
01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.500
Liar!

1547
01:43:29.625 --> 01:43:30.750
Take her to the car.

1548
01:43:31.333 --> 01:43:32.416
Papa!

1549
01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:34.041
Let me go!

1550
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:35.666
Papa!

1551
01:43:36.250 --> 01:43:38.250
Ressa, Tika, run!

1552
01:43:38.333 --> 01:43:39.583
Let me go, Papa.

1553
01:43:39.666 --> 01:43:41.166
Slut's son, where are you going?

1554
01:43:41.250 --> 01:43:42.125
Run, Tika!

1555
01:43:43.625 --> 01:43:44.750
Hey!

1556
01:43:58.875 --> 01:44:00.041
Get him.

1557
01:44:00.125 --> 01:44:01.208
Rosso!

1558
01:44:02.083 --> 01:44:03.208
Bastard! I'll kill you!

1559
01:44:03.291 --> 01:44:04.166
Tarjo!

1560
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:05.875
Shut up, Tika!

1561
01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:08.416
Narti, Narti.

1562
01:44:09.333 --> 01:44:12.083
You're very clever...

1563
01:44:12.166 --> 01:44:15.416
at keeping Darsono's stuff.

1564
01:44:17.208 --> 01:44:19.250
The documents that you're looking for...

1565
01:44:19.333 --> 01:44:23.000
are buried with my Grandpa in Alas Kiwo.

1566
01:44:23.083 --> 01:44:26.666
You can't fool me, I know it's not true.

1567
01:44:30.333 --> 01:44:33.708
I dug up the grave in Alas Kiwo, Tika.

1568
01:44:34.291 --> 01:44:36.875
The deeper I dug,

1569
01:44:36.958 --> 01:44:39.625
I found nothing other than
the bones of Communist Party members.

1570
01:44:40.416 --> 01:44:42.833
There's no Mustika Rasa document.

1571
01:44:43.458 --> 01:44:45.333
How much did he pay you?

1572
01:44:46.541 --> 01:44:49.041
To the point that you
betray your own family?

1573
01:44:49.916 --> 01:44:53.416
I want to save our family, Tika!

1574
01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.750
Especially you and your Grandma.

1575
01:44:56.333 --> 01:44:59.125
Mustika Rasa is cursed.

1576
01:44:59.208 --> 01:45:01.791
It's better to give it to Mr. Broto.

1577
01:45:01.875 --> 01:45:02.750
No way!

1578
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:04.833
What?

1579
01:45:06.166 --> 01:45:08.333
Too much drama.

1580
01:45:08.416 --> 01:45:09.750
Broto, you bastard!

1581
01:45:09.833 --> 01:45:10.833
Shut up!

1582
01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.208
Evil General!

1583
01:45:15.708 --> 01:45:17.500
I'll kill your boyfriend...

1584
01:45:18.375 --> 01:45:21.125
if you keep silent.

1585
01:45:22.166 --> 01:45:23.166
Where did you hide it?

1586
01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:24.291
Where?

1587
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.916
Where did you hide that document?

1588
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.375
I'll count to three,

1589
01:45:30.458 --> 01:45:32.750
then I'll blow your boyfriend's head off.

1590
01:45:32.833 --> 01:45:34.375
One!

1591
01:45:34.458 --> 01:45:35.666
- Two!
- Don't!

1592
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:38.500
- Thre...
- The spices store room!

1593
01:45:39.958 --> 01:45:40.875
What?

1594
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:43.916
The spices store room.

1595
01:45:50.666 --> 01:45:52.541
The spices store room!

1596
01:45:59.291 --> 01:46:00.750
Thank you!

1597
01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:18.208
Rosso!

1598
01:46:18.291 --> 01:46:20.250
There's no need to be dramatic,
just give it to us!

1599
01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:22.500
Come on!

1600
01:46:23.625 --> 01:46:24.458
Where is it?

1601
01:46:26.541 --> 01:46:28.000
Why are you standing still? Hurry up!

1602
01:46:28.625 --> 01:46:29.500
Tika!

1603
01:46:29.583 --> 01:46:31.625
Where's that document?

1604
01:46:32.208 --> 01:46:33.916
Do not prolong it!

1605
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.083
I'll kill your boyfriend
if you keep slowing us down!

1606
01:46:37.875 --> 01:46:39.000
Lead us, Tika!

1607
01:46:40.083 --> 01:46:43.166
Why did you open that jar?

1608
01:46:44.625 --> 01:46:45.916
Where is it exactly?

1609
01:46:51.333 --> 01:46:55.250
Darsono, Darsono!

1610
01:46:55.333 --> 01:46:57.125
Lead the way, Tika!

1611
01:46:57.750 --> 01:47:00.416
Darsono, what a clever man!

1612
01:47:02.375 --> 01:47:03.416
Wow.

1613
01:47:06.333 --> 01:47:07.958
It's just like this.

1614
01:47:09.333 --> 01:47:10.833
Hurry up!

1615
01:47:12.375 --> 01:47:13.416
Where?

1616
01:47:14.916 --> 01:47:15.958
What a slow person!

1617
01:47:16.041 --> 01:47:18.125
Search it!

1618
01:47:20.041 --> 01:47:21.208
Got it?

1619
01:47:25.791 --> 01:47:27.958
Where do you keep the documents?

1620
01:47:32.375 --> 01:47:33.625
Where is it?

1621
01:47:34.666 --> 01:47:35.916
Wait, Sir.

1622
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.333
Here it is!

1623
01:47:38.875 --> 01:47:40.000
Open it up!

1624
01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:41.708
You Moron!

1625
01:47:41.791 --> 01:47:43.916
Give it to her! She knows the code!

1626
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:44.958
Go on.

1627
01:47:46.916 --> 01:47:47.916
Open it!

1628
01:47:48.875 --> 01:47:49.875
Open it!

1629
01:48:10.875 --> 01:48:12.041
Amazing.

1630
01:48:19.541 --> 01:48:21.541
DIRECTIONS

1631
01:48:21.625 --> 01:48:23.291
CLEAN THE BEANS

1632
01:48:23.375 --> 01:48:25.125
Darsono,

1633
01:48:25.208 --> 01:48:27.583
you're a genius!

1634
01:48:29.291 --> 01:48:30.458
Katherine, keep it!

1635
01:48:32.291 --> 01:48:33.291
Yes, Sir.

1636
01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:36.333
Sir. Is that all, Sir?

1637
01:48:36.416 --> 01:48:37.875
Where's the gold?

1638
01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:39.875
Alex!

1639
01:49:10.041 --> 01:49:11.083
Tika!

1640
01:49:12.416 --> 01:49:14.583
Pa, please, Pa.

1641
01:50:22.375 --> 01:50:24.500
Dinda!

1642
01:50:26.875 --> 01:50:27.875
Dinda!

1643
01:50:30.125 --> 01:50:31.083
Dinda!

1644
01:50:32.208 --> 01:50:34.000
Dinda!

1645
01:50:34.083 --> 01:50:35.041
Dinda!

1646
01:50:36.583 --> 01:50:38.041
Dinda!

1647
01:50:39.291 --> 01:50:41.916
Dinda!

1648
01:50:45.875 --> 01:50:47.000
Dinda!

1649
01:50:48.666 --> 01:50:50.291
Dinda!

1650
01:51:02.958 --> 01:51:05.000
Dinda!

1651
01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.750
Do not move!

1652
01:51:14.833 --> 01:51:16.541
Put down your gun!

1653
01:52:11.375 --> 01:52:12.500
Tika, wake up!

1654
01:52:13.625 --> 01:52:14.833
Wake up, Tika!

1655
01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.083
Tika!

1656
01:53:15.875 --> 01:53:17.333
Good morning, Sir.

1657
01:53:18.666 --> 01:53:19.916
Good morning, Katherine.

1658
01:53:21.083 --> 01:53:23.333
These are the Mustika Rasa documents.

1659
01:53:32.125 --> 01:53:33.333
Thank you.

1660
01:53:33.416 --> 01:53:34.833
Yes, Sir. Please, I'll excuse myself.

1661
01:53:35.458 --> 01:53:36.416
Ah, right!

1662
01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:37.791
Please inform Ressa that...

1663
01:53:37.875 --> 01:53:40.000
Mr. President will come

1664
01:53:40.083 --> 01:53:43.791
to his restaurant's grand opening
to show his gratitude since...

1665
01:53:43.875 --> 01:53:46.083
he returned these very important
and confidential documents.

1666
01:53:46.750 --> 01:53:47.750
Yes, Sir.

1667
01:53:47.833 --> 01:53:49.166
I'll inform them.

1668
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:50.083
Please excuse me.

1669
01:53:50.166 --> 01:53:51.208
Go ahead.

1670
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:11.833
Here it is...

1671
01:54:12.791 --> 01:54:14.916
the Indonesian fusion pasta.

1672
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.250
Please enjoy it.

1673
01:54:21.375 --> 01:54:22.958
Please eat.

1674
01:54:23.958 --> 01:54:24.791
Woah...

1675
01:54:24.875 --> 01:54:27.000
- Are you okay, Grandma?
- I'm fine.

1676
01:54:27.083 --> 01:54:28.041
Do you feel uncomfortable?

1677
01:54:28.125 --> 01:54:29.666
I'm okay.

1678
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:31.583
Here it is, Grandma.

1679
01:54:31.666 --> 01:54:32.541
Try it.

1680
01:54:32.625 --> 01:54:33.833
I want to try it.

1681
01:54:33.916 --> 01:54:34.958
Is there any left?

1682
01:54:35.041 --> 01:54:36.083
Yes.

1683
01:54:36.166 --> 01:54:37.500
- There is a lot more.
- Okay.

1684
01:54:38.625 --> 01:54:41.208
I can see from the presentation
that it will taste good.

1685
01:54:41.291 --> 01:54:42.750
Let me try it.

1686
01:54:47.541 --> 01:54:48.541
How is it?

1687
01:54:48.625 --> 01:54:49.583
It is delicious!

1688
01:54:51.041 --> 01:54:51.958
Thank you, Grandma.

1689
01:54:53.250 --> 01:54:56.916
Both of you deserve this.

1690
01:54:57.708 --> 01:55:00.041
Take good care of it, okay?

1691
01:55:02.416 --> 01:55:03.333
Of course, Grandma.

1692
01:55:05.666 --> 01:55:07.625
Tika, Ressa.

1693
01:55:07.708 --> 01:55:10.958
Mr. President is very sorry
that he couldn't attend...

1694
01:55:11.041 --> 01:55:12.958
because he has to go to Papua
to inaugurate the toll road.

1695
01:55:13.625 --> 01:55:16.666
But he sends you a video.

1696
01:55:17.375 --> 01:55:19.125
<i>On behalf of this country,</i>

1697
01:55:19.208 --> 01:55:22.250
<i>I'd like to thank...</i>

1698
01:55:22.333 --> 01:55:26.041
<i>Chef Ressa and Chef Tika,</i>

1699
01:55:26.125 --> 01:55:28.333
<i>who were brave enough to protect</i>

1700
01:55:28.416 --> 01:55:30.166
<i>our country's confidential documents.</i>

1701
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.416
Here's your drink, Sir.

1702
01:56:54.083 --> 01:56:59.083
Sir, may I come to the Rahasia Rasa cafe?
