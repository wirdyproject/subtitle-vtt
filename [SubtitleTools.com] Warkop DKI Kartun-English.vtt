IN LOVING MEMORY OF WARKOP DKI FAMILY

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.958
BAKWAN
LATEST AND SOPHISTICATED NEWS

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.708
The city is under threat from nail traps.

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.500
Nails are scattered all over,

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:01.541
disturbing activities
and endangering the public.

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:05.125
It remains unclear
who is behind this terror,

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:08.375
whether it was done alone
or by a professional group.

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:10.166
Oh, no. Seriously?

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:18.541
Forget a flat tire, it was the car itself!
Gosh! What now?

00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:22.666
What? Oh, no.

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:29.416
Why am I the one going flat?

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.125
No flat Earth!

00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:38.583
No flat Earth!

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:42.250
That raises the question,
what will the government do

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.083
to combat this situation?

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.291
Commander, your thoughts?

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:53.500
At Chiips, we've put together
a special team

00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:58.875
made up of quick, reliable
and alert personnel,

00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.666
and, above all, anti-hoax.

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:13.708
That's the nail. Huh?

00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:17.083
It's alive?

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.166
Come here.

00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:25.208
So outdated.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.666
Bare hands in this day and age?

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.750
Use a tool, like me. Look!

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:33.166
A nail-attracting magnet stick!

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:42.291
Safe roads, comfy back.

00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:45.666
Make way!

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:54.458
Whoa!

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:57.833
Get on my level, I'm with the times.

00:02:57.916 --> 00:03:01.333
Sparkling roads, no worries, no stress,

00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:03.458
and no need to call Andy Lau.

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:09.125
It's all a mess again,
just like your face.

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:10.791
SEPTIC TANK CLEANING

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:13.750
Are we gonna pick up nails forever?

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.000
We won't finish until the end of time.

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:32.083
Why don't we make something?

00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:35.458
-Make chaos?
-A TikTok video?

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:38.458
No!

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.791
I mean build a robot.

00:03:43.083 --> 00:03:44.625
NAIL-REMOVER BOT

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:53.958
I can't see the door!

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:55.083
Ouch!

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:01.208
Sip coffee to stay awake.

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.041
Ouch!

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:22.416
I'm so thirsty.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.833
OIL

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:38.041
-I still can't believe it.
-It looks good.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.708
Don, are you done? Hurry!

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.708
Just hang on. It's done.

00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:46.750
Whoa!

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:50.666
Check it out. See?

00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:55.708
That face looks familiar.

00:04:57.291 --> 00:04:59.791
-Guess who?
-That's yourself!

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:02.333
Should've used my face.
It's better than yours.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.833
Your face isn't up to SNI certification.

00:05:06.916 --> 00:05:09.291
Besides, I made the head myself.

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:12.041
Making this robot unique,
eye-catching, charismatic--

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.458
It's antique, Dro.

00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:17.833
You call that face unique? It's the teeth!

00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:20.041
Exactly!

00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:22.375
There's a reason for these teeth.

00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:24.750
Listen closely. This is the password.

00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:34.625
Its neck is spinning.
You sure it's not broken?

00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:39.500
Didn't think anything else could stand out
besides your teeth.

00:05:40.416 --> 00:05:44.791
I also built a remote
to make things easier.

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:45.916
Here.

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:52.375
Is this robot on? Bot? Hello?

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:53.583
FRIEND

00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:00.375
-Woo-hoo!
-This feels like a carousel!

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:12.583
-Don, help! Your robot is acting up!
-What?

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.500
It just needs some oil.

00:06:21.541 --> 00:06:22.916
It caught a cold?

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.875
Maybe the robot isn't that smart.

00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.458
How come?

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:31.416
Smart robots don't catch cold.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.250
Whoosh, cold out!

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.958
Time to test the robot. Turn it on.

00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:48.500
Wow!

00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:54.875
It's full right away.
Not bad. It's good to go!

00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.833
Time to get the work done.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.333
Come on, let's go!

00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:01.416
NAIL TRAP REMOVAL
IN PROGRESS

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.625
Life's good.

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:22.125
WANTED: NAIL SCAVENGER

00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:30.250
"THE ROADS ARE FINALLY NAIL-FREE"

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:31.958
"BUT EXTORTION CONTINUES"

00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:40.875
PRESS CONFERENCE: CHIIPS ROBOT LAUNCH
"MULTI-PURPOSE NAIL TRAPS REMOVAL ROBOT"

00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:45.666
Thanks to the special team
formed by Chiips,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.625
the public can get back on their feet.
Standing with me now…

00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:56.666
Naturally, it's thanks to my guidance
as their commander.

00:07:57.916 --> 00:08:02.041
What they needed
was a dedicated leader and…

00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:03.250
Trash.

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:06.625
We recycled household waste
into parts for this robot.

00:08:06.708 --> 00:08:08.875
The public is pleased
because their homes are…

00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:09.958
Destroyed.

00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:13.333
This robot is armed to combat crime.

00:08:13.416 --> 00:08:15.500
If there's danger, this robot will…

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:16.583
Whistle.

00:08:16.666 --> 00:08:22.958
If you see a nail trap, just whistle.
The robot will arrive and clean it up.

00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:25.500
-What else?
-Please give the mic back.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
It does a great job removing nail traps,

00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:35.041
but is that all it can do?

00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:38.208
Oh, yes! Not at all.

00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:08.416
Another one.

00:09:15.458 --> 00:09:17.291
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

00:09:21.791 --> 00:09:22.916
So funny!

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:24.750
Another one.

00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:31.666
WASTE SUCTION
EXPRESS

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.625
Amazing!

00:09:33.708 --> 00:09:37.416
This robot's more capable than I thought.

00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:42.833
Robots just follow orders.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.708
The creator holds the real skill.

00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:46.708
FRIEND
FOE

00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:47.666
FRIEND

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.791
What kind of robot do you need?

00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:52.666
This one right here
can do chores at home too.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.583
FOE

00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:54.500
Really?

00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:57.708
I can make another robot if you want.

00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:01.291
This thing's a piece of cake.

00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:02.375
FOE

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:04.666
I can build a better one for you.

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:10.916
It took the remote! Soap opera time?

00:10:13.916 --> 00:10:16.583
-It ate it!
-What's wrong with the robot?

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:25.958
Watch out! Poop truck!

00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:27.583
Brown truck?

00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:29.666
-No, no.
-A shitty truck?

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.666
No, no, no!

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.000
-A truck-shaped poop?
-Almost there.

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:47.458
Don! Turn off the robot!

00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:48.875
You turned it on!

00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:52.166
How do I turn it off?

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.541
You're asking us? We're doomed!

00:10:56.375 --> 00:11:00.083
Dono, Kasino, Indro.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.958
What, Boss?

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.791
Don't just stand there and talk, fix it!

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958
This mess is on you!

00:11:09.041 --> 00:11:14.541
Surely this is the result of your guidance
as their commander,

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.833
just like you said.

00:11:16.916 --> 00:11:19.458
So, the reason
my subordinates are like this

00:11:19.541 --> 00:11:22.666
even though I… Well…

00:11:24.791 --> 00:11:28.916
You think this is a talk show?
Go do your job!

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.958
It's getting dangerous.

00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:38.708
-We better hide for now to stay safe.
-Is that so?

00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:48.208
Run!

00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:04.250
Did you make an emergency button?

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:05.666
Obviously…

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.750
Great!

00:12:06.833 --> 00:12:07.833
…not.

00:12:07.916 --> 00:12:09.166
-What?
-Oh, no.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.583
We need to get the robot out
before it completely wrecks the office!

00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:27.083
Hey, scrap metal!

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:31.041
Crushing dreams is all you've got?
Bring it on if you dare!

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.875
What are you, a leaky gas pipe?

00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.875
One tiny crack and you go off!

00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.000
Gosh.

00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:40.375
Don't be so mean.

00:12:40.458 --> 00:12:42.083
-Can't you…
-Hold on tight!

00:12:42.166 --> 00:12:44.416
-Floor it!
-All in!

00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:07.916
Commander, is it safe now?

00:13:09.083 --> 00:13:11.375
No, we better keep hiding.

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.833
Something's definitely wrong.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.750
Bot, please hang in there.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.666
Excuse me!

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:26.875
That was close.

00:13:33.416 --> 00:13:34.541
Bot!

00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:42.291
-What was that?
-That's out of line.

00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:52.791
I can't see, Don!

00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.666
-Watch out!
-Traffic ahead.

00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:58.791
-Don! Hold on tight! We're going up!
-Okay, Kasino.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.333
Where's the robot?

00:14:07.416 --> 00:14:08.708
Where is it?

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:13.083
Looks like we're clear, Dro.

00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:20.541
FOE

00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:23.583
THIS LAND BELONGS TO THE ALMIGHTY

00:14:29.791 --> 00:14:31.375
POPULATION: THREE PEOPLE

00:14:58.583 --> 00:15:00.458
-Listen, Don, Dro.
-What?

00:15:00.541 --> 00:15:02.625
-Let's set up a decoy.
-What do you mean?

00:15:02.708 --> 00:15:04.791
Dro, you climb up there.

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:08.916
When the robot comes,
it'll try to grab the decoy.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.250
And then I'll drop the load on it.

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:12.333
Okay.

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:28.333
Got you!

00:15:29.791 --> 00:15:30.791
Wait.

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:32.583
WET PAINT!

00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:34.041
Seriously, Dro?

00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:37.250
Kas! Did I miss?

00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:39.500
Blame the wind, not me!

00:15:39.583 --> 00:15:41.500
Oh, Bot!

00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:46.416
Calm down, Bot. Breathe a little.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.208
Hurry up, Dro! You're close!

00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:52.333
Wait. I need to grab more.

00:15:52.416 --> 00:15:55.541
Try talking to it. Maybe it'll listen.

00:15:55.625 --> 00:15:56.625
Gosh!

00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:07.583
How about we make peace, Bot?

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:10.500
Peace? Robots don't know peace!

00:16:12.833 --> 00:16:15.416
Sorry, Mr. Bot, I've only got this much.

00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:21.250
You don't like cash?

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:23.500
Maybe it needs vitamin K.

00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:28.791
Robots don't need vitamin K.
For what, stronger immunity?

00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:30.833
Not that vitamin K.

00:16:30.916 --> 00:16:32.500
It's vitamin Kiss.

00:16:33.708 --> 00:16:35.125
You can't be serious.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.916
You think a forehead kiss
is gonna calm it down?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.583
You're gonna make it worse!

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:41.791
Let's just run!

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:44.000
What do we do, Kas?

00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:50.166
Let's make it chase us
to run down the battery.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.833
You go first, I'll hide for now.
Then we switch.

00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:58.500
-You promise?
-Don't you trust your friend?

00:17:01.458 --> 00:17:03.041
1 LIFE - SCORE 0003

00:17:13.416 --> 00:17:15.541
Kas! Time to switch!

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.375
What? Let me sleep in peace.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.416
Dro!

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.541
Hey, help your friend out!

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:36.083
Good job, Dro! Keep going! No mercy!

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.125
It climbed over?

00:17:40.208 --> 00:17:42.125
How do I let go?

00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:48.000
He's bringing the robot closer!

00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:50.416
Don, your friend is making it worse.

00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:01.583
Bot.

00:18:09.208 --> 00:18:10.708
What's happening?

00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:14.583
Hold on tight, Don. You're safe.

00:18:15.416 --> 00:18:16.416
All thanks to me.

00:18:30.666 --> 00:18:31.666
Bot.

00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:34.208
Please calm down.

00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:37.416
Remember when you first powered on?

00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:42.875
When you tried to walk and fell,

00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:47.625
who was there to help you back up?

00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:54.375
When you hurt your back,

00:18:54.458 --> 00:18:58.125
who gave you your favorite oil?

00:18:58.208 --> 00:18:59.541
FOE

00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:01.625
FRIEND

00:19:02.916 --> 00:19:04.166
Dro!

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.416
Dro! Hey!

00:19:07.916 --> 00:19:09.166
Dro!

00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:12.333
What about Dono?

00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:14.208
Dono…

00:19:18.166 --> 00:19:19.625
RELEASE ONE ROPE

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.583
Dono-Bot!

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.958
Why is he holding on?

00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:53.250
FRIEND

00:19:55.458 --> 00:19:57.458
Just let it go, Don!

00:19:57.541 --> 00:20:02.125
No! Dono-Bot is a good robot.

00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:04.250
Don't listen to them.

00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:05.833
Gosh.

00:20:06.416 --> 00:20:07.416
Let it go!

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.208
That robot's out of control.

00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:11.250
FOE

00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:16.416
FRIEND AND FOE

00:20:18.791 --> 00:20:19.833
Ouch!

00:20:23.625 --> 00:20:27.500
Dono-Bot!

00:20:39.583 --> 00:20:41.291
Dono-Bot.

00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:57.875
Calm down, Don. We'll make another one.

00:20:57.958 --> 00:21:01.708
Just not with your face,
it might glitch again.

00:21:01.791 --> 00:21:04.833
It probably glitched itself
out of disgust.

00:21:06.583 --> 00:21:09.791
Let's build the next robot from baby mode.

00:21:09.875 --> 00:21:12.625
Teach it to pray, so it has morals.

00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:15.583
Send it to a top school,

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.666
so it memorizes Pancasila
and the Constitution.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.125
-Right?
-Yeah. And teach it to respect parents.

00:21:21.208 --> 00:21:25.375
Raise it right, no drugs,
no nightlife, no street racing.

00:21:25.458 --> 00:21:30.541
Maybe even send it into Kumon
so it can count like rice seller agents.

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:34.583
But Dono-Bot is a good kid!

00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:37.250
Easy, easy.

00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:04.333
CHEATING EVERYWHERE

00:22:05.416 --> 00:22:07.458
-Come on, don't be late.
-Yes, Mom.

00:22:07.541 --> 00:22:10.750
-Keep going.
-I win! You're too slow!

00:22:10.833 --> 00:22:13.583
Wait for me! You're cheating.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.083
You snatched it without thinking.

00:22:17.166 --> 00:22:19.458
I was just following Dono.

00:22:19.541 --> 00:22:22.375
I didn't know it'd end up like this!

00:22:25.041 --> 00:22:27.083
BUDIMAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:22:30.291 --> 00:22:33.250
CASE NO. 6161:
NATIONAL EXAM LEAKAGE

00:22:34.208 --> 00:22:35.250
Hello, Boss.

00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:36.750
-Excuse me, Boss.
-Pardon me.

00:22:36.833 --> 00:22:39.375
Please, sit down.

00:22:44.458 --> 00:22:45.583
A kid's chair?

00:22:52.291 --> 00:22:54.791
Go ahead, drink up.

00:22:57.208 --> 00:22:58.833
That's rare, he served us drinks.

00:22:58.916 --> 00:23:02.666
Right. He's up to something for sure.

00:23:03.208 --> 00:23:05.291
There's a shrimp under the pole.

00:23:05.375 --> 00:23:10.708
You're wrong.
It's a shrimp… is the loudest.

00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:12.500
Idiots, all of you.

00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:15.458
It's rippling water is full of shrimps.

00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:18.083
Just have a sip.

00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:22.500
What are you waiting for? Enjoy it.

00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:25.333
Okay, Boss.

00:23:25.416 --> 00:23:27.375
-We're still on the clock.
-Right.

00:23:28.416 --> 00:23:31.791
How about we hear you out first?

00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:34.166
He's right.

00:23:34.708 --> 00:23:37.333
The drinks can wait.

00:23:38.666 --> 00:23:43.666
Your next mission is to uncover
the mafia syndicate in education.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.083
The bachelor's degree mafia? Cum laude?

00:23:47.166 --> 00:23:48.458
What is he talking about?

00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:51.458
Enough. Pay attention.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.500
NATIONAL EXAM LEAKAGE

00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:00.791
I see.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.041
Come closer.

00:24:11.458 --> 00:24:12.666
Closer.

00:24:15.458 --> 00:24:19.750
You'll be going undercover
as secret agents.

00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:20.833
A secret agent?

00:24:24.458 --> 00:24:26.458
What kind of secret?

00:24:29.083 --> 00:24:31.583
Your mission is to expose

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:36.291
the national exam answer smugglers

00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:39.916
before… it's too late.

00:24:42.333 --> 00:24:43.750
Define "too late", Boss.

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.875
Here's to a successful mission. Cheers!

00:25:05.166 --> 00:25:07.208
-Let's toast.
-Yes, Boss.

00:25:07.291 --> 00:25:08.541
Cheers. Yeah.

00:25:14.833 --> 00:25:15.666
Come on.

00:25:16.833 --> 00:25:18.583
-Yes, Boss.
-Okay.

00:25:19.416 --> 00:25:20.875
Looks like I have to do it.

00:25:20.958 --> 00:25:21.791
Okay, okay.

00:25:23.708 --> 00:25:25.333
To a successful mission.

00:25:32.583 --> 00:25:36.458
You'll be going undercover
as elementary school kids.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.583
Never thought I'd say
you're adorable, Boss.

00:25:44.666 --> 00:25:45.708
Such a baby face!

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.791
You played yourself.

00:25:50.375 --> 00:25:51.708
This looks good.

00:25:51.791 --> 00:25:53.375
-Let me have some.
-Me too.

00:26:06.541 --> 00:26:10.125
You thought it was just the drink?

00:26:12.125 --> 00:26:14.125
Forget this cake,

00:26:14.208 --> 00:26:18.250
even licking the wall
would turn you into kids!

00:26:20.708 --> 00:26:23.458
Hook, line and sinker!

00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:29.916
Mister! I want some.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.083
One tempe, please.

00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:33.625
Dilan!

00:26:33.708 --> 00:26:35.208
Our prince!

00:26:35.291 --> 00:26:36.625
Dilan!

00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:42.916
We got a celeb over here.

00:26:45.333 --> 00:26:46.625
Alpha Bravo, get down.

00:26:48.791 --> 00:26:53.250
A general's kid!
You'd think it's a military op.

00:26:53.333 --> 00:26:55.458
Probably served in the army
for nine years.

00:26:55.541 --> 00:26:57.041
Come on, it's just school.

00:26:57.125 --> 00:26:59.458
That kid's barely nine.

00:26:59.541 --> 00:27:01.666
No way he's been training since birth.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.583
I'm sure this is the Pharaoh's kid.

00:27:04.666 --> 00:27:08.208
Yeah, right. Pharaoh's kids
would be homeschooled.

00:27:08.291 --> 00:27:09.666
What about them?

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.416
Must be Bekasi kids.
They're camping so they won't be late.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.791
Study well, my grandchild.

00:27:18.458 --> 00:27:20.250
Might as well throw a party.

00:27:26.666 --> 00:27:28.750
Lucky me. I'm hungry.

00:27:29.541 --> 00:27:30.666
Let's grab a snack.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.833
-Agreed!
-Let's go!

00:27:37.708 --> 00:27:38.791
How much for this?

00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:40.416
750,000.

00:27:41.916 --> 00:27:43.125
750,000?

00:27:44.291 --> 00:27:46.208
It's worth a motorcycle down payment!

00:27:46.916 --> 00:27:48.208
How'd you know?

00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:50.250
I'm trying to do that.

00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:52.750
If you want to get rich, be a TikTok star,

00:27:52.833 --> 00:27:56.291
post dance clips
and go viral to get brand deals!

00:27:56.375 --> 00:27:57.458
Not sell fritters.

00:27:57.541 --> 00:28:00.958
My tofu is filled with knowledge.
It's priceless.

00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:04.750
My banana fritters
are straight from Raja Ampat.

00:28:05.833 --> 00:28:07.708
You guys eat like it's nothing.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.291
I still have the company's money.

00:28:11.208 --> 00:28:13.250
-Give it to me, Dro.
-Here.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.958
-It's not enough.
-Here.

00:28:17.208 --> 00:28:18.416
Just this much?

00:28:20.333 --> 00:28:23.000
I lost my money. My pockets were torn.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.250
Kas, it's the cashless era now.

00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:29.958
Cashless? We're already have less cash!

00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:33.208
I accept cashless.

00:28:35.666 --> 00:28:36.791
Wow, cashback.

00:28:38.041 --> 00:28:40.458
We went from cash-less to cash back!

00:28:41.625 --> 00:28:43.375
Dro, look.

00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:46.500
What's up with students these days?

00:28:46.583 --> 00:28:48.416
SCIENCE

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.500
What is he doing?

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.958
SUNDANESE DICT
BASIC-QUICK MATH

00:28:52.041 --> 00:28:53.750
Wow, he blended it!

00:28:55.458 --> 00:28:57.041
A steak-book?

00:28:57.625 --> 00:28:58.458
FLOOR PAINT

00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:00.541
-Hey, look.
-What is it, Kas?

00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:05.208
Don, Dro.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:09.208
-That must be the culprit.
-Where?

00:29:15.458 --> 00:29:19.125
This restroom's got
Affandi-style expressionism.

00:29:19.208 --> 00:29:21.458
Hello, culprit?

00:29:22.541 --> 00:29:23.583
Wow.

00:29:24.333 --> 00:29:26.250
This must be a secret code.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.833
What?

00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:35.708
It means someone switched underwear
because their poop was runny.

00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:38.083
Kids these days are pretty clever.

00:29:44.958 --> 00:29:46.958
You're too young to be a criminal!

00:29:47.041 --> 00:29:49.125
What? You're interrupting me.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.625
He's painting a rainbow.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.375
You must be Grand.

00:29:56.208 --> 00:29:57.833
-How'd you know?
-Well…

00:29:58.416 --> 00:30:02.208
Your painter is Grand, who could it be?

00:30:03.375 --> 00:30:05.291
-Who?
-It's Grand, of course!

00:30:06.125 --> 00:30:07.208
Right.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.791
I paint before exams
to keep the stress away!

00:30:11.875 --> 00:30:16.000
If he's got time to stress out,
he's got time to study.

00:30:16.083 --> 00:30:17.125
Right.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.958
-Do you have it?
-Here.

00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:25.500
-This better be the right one.
-Not bad.

00:30:29.583 --> 00:30:30.583
Hey!

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:40.750
After her!

00:31:07.583 --> 00:31:10.375
You're not going anywhere now. Ouch!

00:31:22.833 --> 00:31:23.833
I'm sorry.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.666
Where are you going?

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.916
You're too young for this!

00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:30.541
Are you a dealer?

00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:33.708
I'm sorry. No, I'm not.

00:31:34.416 --> 00:31:39.750
This country's future is grim
if kids like you are selling cheat sheets.

00:31:40.708 --> 00:31:43.541
No, I gave her fake cheat sheet.

00:31:43.625 --> 00:31:45.041
What do you mean?

00:31:45.125 --> 00:31:47.791
She used to bully me in kindergarten.

00:31:47.875 --> 00:31:53.208
So I gave her a fake cheat sheet
as payback.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.791
She's held a grudge since kindergarten.

00:31:57.875 --> 00:32:02.208
And it's still going strong.
Until death do you part.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.125
Amen.

00:32:07.041 --> 00:32:08.250
Dro, Don.

00:32:09.541 --> 00:32:14.541
We need a more effective way
to find the culprit.

00:32:14.625 --> 00:32:18.458
Yes. We must catch them
before the exam starts.

00:32:18.541 --> 00:32:19.541
I agree.

00:32:19.625 --> 00:32:21.750
So? Any questions?

00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:23.916
Anyone got any questions?

00:32:25.125 --> 00:32:27.875
Brats! What are you doing there? Get down!

00:32:27.958 --> 00:32:29.333
You want some of this?

00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:32.375
Ouch! We're sorry.

00:32:32.458 --> 00:32:33.916
You're gonna rip it off!

00:32:36.291 --> 00:32:37.916
Why are you pinching mine?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
One gets pinched,
we all get pinched. Ouch!

00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:41.041
Now that's fair.

00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:43.541
Get inside. Now!

00:32:44.666 --> 00:32:45.750
Or else I'll go.

00:32:46.333 --> 00:32:47.916
Is this a military school?

00:32:48.916 --> 00:32:51.041
KEEP QUIET. EXAM IN PROGRESS

00:32:52.458 --> 00:32:53.458
CLASS 6-A

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:58.041
DO NOT CHEAT!

00:32:58.125 --> 00:32:59.500
Good morning, everyone.

00:33:00.583 --> 00:33:03.208
Nice to meet you, I'm a teacher here.

00:33:04.458 --> 00:33:07.041
Well, obviously. I'm not a minibus driver.

00:33:11.041 --> 00:33:12.958
KEEP QUIET! EXAM IN PROGRESS

00:33:15.083 --> 00:33:17.458
Sorry. Your minibus is in the way.

00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:19.541
Give me the keys so I can move it.

00:33:25.833 --> 00:33:28.708
That's just a hobby to earn extra cash.

00:33:29.375 --> 00:33:32.625
Keep in mind, I'm your proctor here.

00:33:32.708 --> 00:33:36.291
No cheating! If I see you cheat,

00:33:36.375 --> 00:33:40.208
I'll rip your lips off
and give them to your friend.

00:33:40.291 --> 00:33:41.791
Sharing is caring, right?

00:33:43.875 --> 00:33:48.625
Pass it around,
make sure everyone gets one.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:52.416
The back row's still waiting,
there you go.

00:33:53.416 --> 00:33:56.125
This is our last chance
before it's too late.

00:33:56.916 --> 00:33:59.583
Seems like there's an insider
leaking answers.

00:33:59.666 --> 00:34:02.833
How hard can the test be
that people are selling answers?

00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:06.666
How can we answer this?

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.666
"In the song Ambilkan Bulan,
do they end up taking the moon?"

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.166
What's the answer?

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.833
"What's the gap
between dark and light green?"

00:34:13.916 --> 00:34:15.458
Everyone got their sheets?

00:34:16.125 --> 00:34:18.125
Sit tight, sit straight.

00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:21.875
You've got 120 minutes

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:23.875
starting from…

00:34:26.916 --> 00:34:28.625
Any guesses?

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.208
From Cinere? Gandul?

00:34:32.875 --> 00:34:35.000
Starting from now!

00:34:48.708 --> 00:34:52.541
Geez. You had to break your arm
just to cheat?

00:34:56.541 --> 00:34:58.541
That guy's abused his forehead.

00:35:00.541 --> 00:35:01.833
He took off his pants?

00:35:08.625 --> 00:35:09.666
Her hair fell off!

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.041
Miss, it's backwards.

00:35:12.583 --> 00:35:13.958
That's some high-tech.

00:35:28.416 --> 00:35:31.041
Piece of cake.
Glad I went to a cram school.

00:35:32.916 --> 00:35:34.583
Damn it.

00:35:36.208 --> 00:35:37.500
Wait.

00:35:40.666 --> 00:35:41.750
Fritters?

00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:44.708
Eating mid-exam?

00:35:45.958 --> 00:35:47.291
Greasy paper?

00:35:48.166 --> 00:35:49.250
Greasy?

00:35:54.291 --> 00:35:56.625
This is the cheat sheet!

00:35:57.541 --> 00:35:58.666
Where did you get it?

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:02.208
Should've said so earlier!
My hair's falling out from thinking.

00:36:02.291 --> 00:36:03.291
Hey!

00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:08.333
You three better not cheat,
or I'll poke your eyes!

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.125
Over there! The dealer is running away!

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.250
Hey! Stop running!

00:36:23.875 --> 00:36:24.958
Am I busted?

00:36:26.416 --> 00:36:30.250
The exam isn't over yet! Don't run off!

00:36:31.583 --> 00:36:35.166
Good luck when it's God testing you.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.958
Hey! Stop running!

00:36:37.541 --> 00:36:41.041
-Hey, fritter-face! Get back here!
-Wait, you tofu-filled fraud!

00:36:42.958 --> 00:36:44.166
Gosh!

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:47.625
They ran off. Stop!
How am I gonna catch them?

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:51.833
I can use that.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.916
Stop running!

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.416
Mister, can you go faster?

00:36:57.416 --> 00:36:58.458
Full throttle!

00:36:58.541 --> 00:37:00.375
Come on, Kas, Dro!

00:37:00.458 --> 00:37:02.250
-Hurry!
-Worry about yourself.

00:37:02.333 --> 00:37:03.166
After him!

00:37:03.791 --> 00:37:05.291
-This way.
-I know, Kas.

00:37:05.375 --> 00:37:06.208
Wait up!

00:37:07.166 --> 00:37:08.000
Transform!

00:37:09.916 --> 00:37:12.041
-What?
-No way!

00:37:13.291 --> 00:37:15.791
-That's impressive.
-It turned into a robot?

00:37:26.666 --> 00:37:29.166
-Mister, stop!
-I've got a leg cramp.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.875
-Hey! Stop!
-Stop!

00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:34.208
Stop running!

00:37:39.916 --> 00:37:42.541
Have a taste of my fritters' oil!

00:37:46.291 --> 00:37:47.500
It's slippery, Kas!

00:37:47.583 --> 00:37:48.791
-I'm getting dizzy.
-Hey!

00:37:52.958 --> 00:37:55.500
Thank goodness. I survived.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.541
Hey! Wait up!

00:38:08.958 --> 00:38:11.291
-A car!
-Excuse me!

00:38:21.791 --> 00:38:23.041
You missed!

00:38:23.125 --> 00:38:24.250
Can I get a tempe?

00:38:30.791 --> 00:38:31.708
Where's the chili?

00:38:39.208 --> 00:38:42.083
-It's a mess!
-All my stuff's destroyed!

00:38:44.791 --> 00:38:45.833
I can't see!

00:38:53.708 --> 00:38:55.083
Catch me if you can!

00:39:01.458 --> 00:39:04.000
Ouch! Again?

00:39:06.125 --> 00:39:08.625
That damn fritter seller!

00:39:13.833 --> 00:39:15.000
What's this?

00:39:17.166 --> 00:39:18.208
I see.

00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:19.833
I got it.

00:39:21.416 --> 00:39:22.458
Let's try that.

00:39:23.916 --> 00:39:26.875
Kas, Dro! Let's stop for a bit.

00:39:29.208 --> 00:39:30.791
He's gonna get away.

00:39:33.041 --> 00:39:34.333
What's up, Don?

00:39:34.416 --> 00:39:35.416
Wait.

00:39:38.083 --> 00:39:39.583
Okay, and…

00:39:41.791 --> 00:39:45.083
Kas, Dro, follow me. Come on.

00:39:46.708 --> 00:39:49.666
Pedal faster! Let's go! Faster!

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:55.875
Crash into the car! One, two, jump!

00:40:07.875 --> 00:40:10.041
Enjoy the show with a drink.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:22.750
DOOR OPENS

00:40:25.875 --> 00:40:26.875
It's open!

00:40:37.666 --> 00:40:40.166
What happened to my nose?

00:40:41.541 --> 00:40:43.125
It missed, Don.

00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:44.791
Relax. It's not over yet.

00:41:09.666 --> 00:41:12.875
Ouch! Something got into my eye!

00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:15.416
My eye! It stings!

00:41:21.458 --> 00:41:23.083
So, you had it in you, Don.

00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:25.916
Gotcha.

00:41:29.875 --> 00:41:33.000
We caught up. I'm heading home now.

00:41:33.083 --> 00:41:34.666
Thanks, mister.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:37.041
Wow! Where do you work out?

00:41:38.166 --> 00:41:39.750
Where is this?

00:41:40.666 --> 00:41:43.125
Hey, you delinquents!

00:41:44.208 --> 00:41:48.208
What delinquents? We're after him,
the cheat sheet dealer!

00:41:48.833 --> 00:41:52.458
Ouch, my eye still hurts!

00:41:52.541 --> 00:41:53.833
Fine, I admit it!

00:42:00.125 --> 00:42:02.250
Thanks for the help, Boss Chiips.

00:42:02.333 --> 00:42:04.208
You may be small, but…

00:42:05.416 --> 00:42:06.375
Bald!

00:42:09.208 --> 00:42:15.208
It's really thanks to
my subordinates' hard work and maturity.

00:42:16.375 --> 00:42:19.125
Now that this has come to light,

00:42:19.208 --> 00:42:21.833
the National Exam will be rescheduled!

00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:25.000
Hurry, Kas!

00:42:26.833 --> 00:42:28.416
Good idea, sir.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.166
-But…
-Kas.

00:42:31.416 --> 00:42:33.833
-Let's make them pay.
-What do we do, Dro?

00:42:33.916 --> 00:42:35.916
It's about time for us to go.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.333
There's an even bigger threat. Excuse us.

00:42:40.708 --> 00:42:42.333
Run!

00:42:42.416 --> 00:42:44.583
Don, Dro! Full speed ahead!

00:42:50.416 --> 00:42:55.250
BACK AND FORTH OFFSIDE

00:42:56.375 --> 00:42:59.708
Good afternoon,
viewers from across Indonesia.

00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:03.291
Today is the World Cup playoff match.

00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:06.333
-The match that will decide…
-Indonesia!

00:43:06.416 --> 00:43:09.625
…who qualifies for
the 2036 World Cup finals,

00:43:09.708 --> 00:43:14.000
West Korea vs. Indonesia!

00:43:14.083 --> 00:43:17.375
This is a live broadcast
from West Korea Stadium,

00:43:17.458 --> 00:43:21.708
and I'm just as excited as all of you

00:43:21.791 --> 00:43:25.291
because we're about to witness our team

00:43:25.375 --> 00:43:28.958
give their body and soul for victory.

00:43:29.041 --> 00:43:30.541
Give it your all, Garuda!

00:43:32.166 --> 00:43:34.083
-Hey!
-They can't hear you.

00:43:34.166 --> 00:43:35.750
Try louder, Commander.

00:43:35.833 --> 00:43:38.791
I am loud. It's not me, they're just deaf.

00:43:38.875 --> 00:43:39.875
That's true.

00:43:43.333 --> 00:43:46.875
Is this a stadium or a zoo?
What's with the wildlife noises?

00:43:52.583 --> 00:43:53.583
Hey!

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:59.916
Okay! Do your job seriously!

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.458
Don't embarrass us!

00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:03.916
-Yes, Boss.
-Yes, Boss.

00:44:08.458 --> 00:44:10.000
SECURITY

00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:19.250
I have a bad feeling about them.

00:44:19.333 --> 00:44:20.541
They're scary.

00:44:38.125 --> 00:44:39.250
-He's burnt.
-Yeah.

00:44:41.416 --> 00:44:42.958
What, even a tank?

00:44:48.416 --> 00:44:52.541
Relax. He's all muscle, no skill.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:55.541
Look at our team.

00:44:57.041 --> 00:44:58.041
See?

00:45:02.916 --> 00:45:06.416
It's spinning around
like someone dodging an inspection.

00:45:07.166 --> 00:45:09.833
Is this football or circus?

00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:16.666
-Is the goalie on his phone?
-Must be a pro.

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:18.125
Probably to post on TikTok.

00:45:18.208 --> 00:45:19.708
Is the goal a brand deal?

00:45:20.875 --> 00:45:23.083
I believe Indonesia can win.

00:45:24.333 --> 00:45:27.333
But if they don't,
are we gonna get attacked?

00:45:27.416 --> 00:45:31.708
What are you saying?
We're not getting jumped if they lose.

00:45:31.791 --> 00:45:34.041
-Maybe a fine for the field.
-Right.

00:45:34.125 --> 00:45:36.958
This is world-class, not class meet.

00:45:40.791 --> 00:45:41.875
Who are they?

00:45:41.958 --> 00:45:44.083
Their sharp looks can cut you.

00:45:44.666 --> 00:45:46.583
He's built like a Murtabak cart.

00:45:49.583 --> 00:45:52.416
Get ready for an intense match.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:56.125
Don't even try to resist,

00:45:56.208 --> 00:45:57.625
or we'll come for you.

00:46:03.166 --> 00:46:04.125
Got it?

00:46:04.208 --> 00:46:05.208
Yes, sir.

00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:13.791
Excuse me, what did he say?

00:46:14.416 --> 00:46:17.541
All I heard is, if we win,

00:46:17.625 --> 00:46:19.750
they'll invade Indonesia.

00:46:19.833 --> 00:46:20.791
What?

00:46:20.875 --> 00:46:22.375
And…

00:46:22.458 --> 00:46:25.291
Honestly, I don't really know.

00:46:25.375 --> 00:46:27.375
I learned foreign languages from movies.

00:46:27.458 --> 00:46:28.875
What movie?

00:46:29.625 --> 00:46:31.083
Warkop movies.

00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:36.000
Them? They can barely speak
proper Indonesian.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.750
I feel like something shady is going on.

00:46:42.666 --> 00:46:44.666
Let's report it to the commander!

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.541
Hold up, don't go reporting just yet.

00:46:48.625 --> 00:46:51.541
Let's investigate first,
find the evidence,

00:46:51.625 --> 00:46:53.583
then report to the commander.

00:46:53.666 --> 00:46:55.708
I agree. What do you think, Don?

00:46:55.791 --> 00:46:57.458
All right. Where do we start?

00:47:05.166 --> 00:47:06.458
What's wrong, Kas?

00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:07.916
-A hostage?
-Electrocuted?

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.375
It's empty. Wrong room.

00:47:13.416 --> 00:47:15.208
-Kas, hurry.
-I know, Dro.

00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:16.333
Stay still.

00:47:17.125 --> 00:47:18.916
I smell something fishy.

00:47:20.416 --> 00:47:23.583
Like a fish market? What do you see?

00:47:24.333 --> 00:47:25.500
Let me see.

00:47:25.583 --> 00:47:27.083
Me too.

00:47:28.166 --> 00:47:31.041
Just be patient. I'll tell you later.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.166
Focus on your breathing.

00:47:38.375 --> 00:47:39.541
Oh, my God!

00:47:47.541 --> 00:47:49.458
Don, is your phone buzzing?

00:47:50.583 --> 00:47:51.625
Not me, Kas.

00:47:52.208 --> 00:47:53.250
Is it Indro's?

00:47:54.166 --> 00:47:56.458
No, it's my legs.

00:48:00.208 --> 00:48:02.833
Damn it, they scored again!

00:48:02.916 --> 00:48:04.166
Unbelievable!

00:48:04.875 --> 00:48:06.458
Kas, get a grip!

00:48:08.666 --> 00:48:11.083
Yeah, sorry. I was shocked.

00:48:11.875 --> 00:48:14.041
Hang on. This could be critical.

00:48:16.875 --> 00:48:18.125
Understood?

00:48:18.208 --> 00:48:19.291
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:48:19.791 --> 00:48:20.791
Up.

00:48:33.666 --> 00:48:36.291
You're here? Then who's holding us up?

00:48:43.708 --> 00:48:46.875
Hey, Dro! Are you kidding me?

00:48:47.666 --> 00:48:49.125
If you're tired, just say so!

00:48:49.208 --> 00:48:51.000
I've been saying it this whole time!

00:48:51.083 --> 00:48:53.250
Calm down.

00:48:53.333 --> 00:48:54.583
So, what did you see?

00:48:54.666 --> 00:48:57.541
This is bad, we can't let this happen.

00:48:57.625 --> 00:49:02.000
I've been thinking of a way to stop it.

00:49:02.083 --> 00:49:06.458
If we report it to the commander now,
he won't believe us.

00:49:06.541 --> 00:49:10.000
The thing is, you haven't told us
what the problem is!

00:49:11.541 --> 00:49:13.250
Right. Sorry, Dro.

00:49:15.958 --> 00:49:17.000
Listen up.

00:49:17.791 --> 00:49:22.750
I saw five West Korean generals
having a meeting.

00:49:22.833 --> 00:49:26.041
Their President was among them.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.750
One general is presenting
in front of a screen with the TV,

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:35.333
showing a missile launch simulation,

00:49:35.416 --> 00:49:38.916
triggered by Indonesia's goal.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.333
The more we win,
the more missiles they fire.

00:49:42.416 --> 00:49:44.375
Do you get it?

00:49:45.375 --> 00:49:46.916
What?

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.708
What should we do now, Kas?

00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:53.708
I think we should run.

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:59.500
Running? Seriously? We're Chiips.
We're supposed to be brave.

00:50:00.125 --> 00:50:01.333
Not that, Kas.

00:50:01.875 --> 00:50:03.083
Look.

00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:05.458
Run away!

00:50:09.083 --> 00:50:12.625
Guys! Don't leave me behind!

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.500
Looking for someone? No one's here. Bye.

00:50:26.166 --> 00:50:29.625
BP sends the ball right towards the goal,

00:50:29.708 --> 00:50:32.125
takes the shot, and…

00:50:32.208 --> 00:50:34.583
So close! The crowd's not happy.

00:50:34.666 --> 00:50:38.041
Indonesia is in a tight spot.

00:50:38.125 --> 00:50:44.041
Moving up and down, back and forth,
dodging opponents!

00:50:44.125 --> 00:50:49.875
The struggle continues
as they're still being chased down!

00:50:49.958 --> 00:50:51.833
They were once level on the scoreboard,

00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:55.958
but now Indonesia is giving their all
to maintain the lead.

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:11.916
The chase goes on,
Korea is right behind them!

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.875
But Indonesia finds an opening!

00:51:19.916 --> 00:51:23.166
All right, viewers,
that wraps up the first half.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:29.750
Indonesia is ahead of West Korea, 2 to 0.

00:51:29.833 --> 00:51:30.958
Back to the studio.

00:51:38.416 --> 00:51:42.000
Kas, let's tell them.

00:51:42.083 --> 00:51:45.625
No, Don.
You think they're gonna believe us?

00:51:45.708 --> 00:51:46.958
So what now?

00:51:50.375 --> 00:51:51.750
I have an idea.

00:51:51.833 --> 00:51:54.000
We'll make Indonesia lose.

00:51:54.083 --> 00:51:56.458
-Lose?
-So we don't get nuked?

00:52:04.625 --> 00:52:05.708
Unique, isn't it?

00:52:14.708 --> 00:52:18.875
-Settle down. Kasino's here.
-Kas. You didn't change your name?

00:52:18.958 --> 00:52:20.416
You can do Ikar Kasino.

00:52:22.375 --> 00:52:25.458
No way. My name sounds like
a foreigner already.

00:52:25.541 --> 00:52:28.583
Cappuccino, Italiano, Kasino.

00:52:29.583 --> 00:52:30.708
Right.

00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:37.291
We know.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.625
Don't be like that, you rude referee.

00:52:43.125 --> 00:52:44.500
What a blockhead.

00:52:45.291 --> 00:52:48.000
We're back for the second half,

00:52:48.083 --> 00:52:51.791
and Indonesia's coach
has made a bold call,

00:52:51.875 --> 00:52:55.833
subbing in three players
of unknown origin.

00:52:55.916 --> 00:52:58.125
-You sure about this, Kas?
-100%.

00:52:59.208 --> 00:53:02.750
Don't worry,
we'll come out of this as heroes.

00:53:03.791 --> 00:53:06.083
Goodbye, World Cup.

00:53:09.541 --> 00:53:12.541
Wait, what? Commander, look!

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:20.000
Oh, my God. What are they doing?
Go find out, quick!

00:53:20.083 --> 00:53:23.125
They'll ruin everything!

00:53:23.208 --> 00:53:25.208
-Okay. Yes, Commander.
-Go!

00:53:25.833 --> 00:53:28.666
Excuse me.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.583
They're looking for trouble.

00:53:31.833 --> 00:53:34.541
By the way, where'd they get
those jerseys?

00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:36.625
Looks awesome.

00:53:39.291 --> 00:53:42.083
-Everyone, gather around.
-Okay.

00:53:42.166 --> 00:53:44.666
-What is it?
-Listen closely.

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:48.291
Everyone, my dear teammates.

00:53:48.375 --> 00:53:50.958
You all did great in the first half.

00:53:52.208 --> 00:53:55.125
Now it's time to…

00:53:55.208 --> 00:53:56.333
What?

00:53:56.416 --> 00:53:57.833
Take it easy.

00:53:57.916 --> 00:54:01.125
-What is he saying?
-Is he joking?

00:54:01.208 --> 00:54:03.208
-We can't win like that!
-Right!

00:54:03.291 --> 00:54:05.375
Hey, forget about it.

00:54:05.958 --> 00:54:08.833
If you get the ball, pass it to me or him.

00:54:08.916 --> 00:54:10.625
-Who?
-Him.

00:54:10.708 --> 00:54:13.500
This guy's softer than Rafathar's pudding!

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.041
I'm a tofu.

00:54:17.625 --> 00:54:20.000
Don't worry. We're in this together.

00:54:20.708 --> 00:54:23.041
It's the coach's secret plan, got it?

00:54:25.541 --> 00:54:28.083
-Who are they?
-What?

00:54:28.166 --> 00:54:31.708
I thought they were
your secret trump card.

00:54:33.625 --> 00:54:34.708
Secret trump card?

00:54:35.625 --> 00:54:38.000
So secret not even I know who they are.

00:54:50.625 --> 00:54:52.791
-And there's the whistle!
-Kas!

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:57.041
And there's Kasino
dribbling the ball on his own.

00:54:58.333 --> 00:54:59.375
Pass!

00:55:02.375 --> 00:55:05.666
Sorry, I slipped. Just testing the waters.

00:55:07.333 --> 00:55:09.166
There was a miscommunication.

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:12.666
Let's leave that behind
and get back to the field.

00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:16.208
Indonesia's got the ball again,

00:55:16.291 --> 00:55:19.416
BP takes the shot, a header and…

00:55:21.041 --> 00:55:23.333
Goal! Fantastic!

00:55:23.416 --> 00:55:25.083
But what is this, viewers?

00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:30.875
-What now? Offside?
-What do you mean?

00:55:30.958 --> 00:55:36.458
An Indonesian player
is having meatballs mid-game!

00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:38.666
He's the troublemaker!

00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:39.791
Sorry.

00:55:41.708 --> 00:55:46.250
The referee reaches a decision,
it's offside!

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.583
Get a grip!

00:55:51.291 --> 00:55:57.416
Match resumes, BP charges alone,
facing two defenders.

00:55:58.125 --> 00:56:01.000
-Is there support ahead?
-I'm open!

00:56:01.083 --> 00:56:02.166
Pass here!

00:56:03.833 --> 00:56:06.083
-He seems to avoid the left side.
-Hey!

00:56:06.166 --> 00:56:07.625
Hey! Pass the ball!

00:56:08.291 --> 00:56:09.541
Hey! Coo-coo.

00:56:12.583 --> 00:56:16.333
Slick one-two play! BP's in the clear.

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.041
The nerve! He must think I'm a rookie.

00:56:21.125 --> 00:56:22.375
You know what to do.

00:56:23.666 --> 00:56:24.666
Okay.

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:29.333
BP's on the move, charging alone
toward West Korea's defense,

00:56:29.416 --> 00:56:31.375
facing two defenders.

00:56:34.333 --> 00:56:35.833
What was that?

00:56:35.916 --> 00:56:38.833
What did he just do to his own teammate?

00:56:38.916 --> 00:56:41.166
That guy again?

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:44.750
Sorry, I didn't mean to.
Your jersey looks the same.

00:56:44.833 --> 00:56:47.291
Same how? It's different!

00:56:47.375 --> 00:56:49.833
He meant the same tailor.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:51.750
Don, kick the ball!

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:54.416
Kick it? All right.

00:57:08.083 --> 00:57:11.458
That idiot. He scored an own goal.

00:57:15.916 --> 00:57:16.958
Did you find them?

00:57:17.041 --> 00:57:18.416
I think they're hiding.

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:19.458
What now?

00:57:20.833 --> 00:57:23.083
We scored a goal!

00:57:26.708 --> 00:57:27.708
Wait!

00:57:30.333 --> 00:57:31.375
That's them.

00:57:34.458 --> 00:57:37.875
Indonesia has returned
to full defensive mode.

00:57:37.958 --> 00:57:42.666
West Korean players
are trying to break through.

00:57:43.166 --> 00:57:44.833
But it won't be that easy.

00:57:54.916 --> 00:57:58.500
Mr. Kim Chi! Pass it to me!

00:57:59.208 --> 00:58:00.250
He asking me to pass?

00:58:00.333 --> 00:58:03.000
Two Indonesian defenders move in.

00:58:03.083 --> 00:58:05.166
Hurry! Pass it to me!

00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:07.416
He kicked the ball!

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.250
Maradono takes it and…

00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:13.291
He scored the wrong way!

00:58:21.041 --> 00:58:22.458
Dono!

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:26.583
You got it wrong again.

00:58:28.083 --> 00:58:33.833
Here we go again,
another quick attack from Indonesia!

00:58:33.916 --> 00:58:36.875
One defender passed,
the ball's well distributed,

00:58:36.958 --> 00:58:42.291
and BP is now one-on-one with the keeper!

00:58:42.375 --> 00:58:48.541
He goes straight in! And kicks it! And…

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:50.583
No!

00:58:50.666 --> 00:58:53.333
Why is Indro guarding that goal?

00:58:53.416 --> 00:58:55.416
That's not ours!

00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.958
Sorry, reflex kicked in.

00:58:58.541 --> 00:59:00.041
I thought it was my post.

00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:04.000
-Now you blundered too?
-Damn brat!

00:59:04.083 --> 00:59:07.916
How does a keeper forget their own goal?

00:59:08.708 --> 00:59:10.041
Good job, Dro.

00:59:12.458 --> 00:59:16.375
The West Korean goalie
prepares for the free kick.

00:59:17.666 --> 00:59:19.416
No defenders ahead.

00:59:20.166 --> 00:59:21.208
He shoots!

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:23.333
Hey! Where are you going?

00:59:23.416 --> 00:59:25.958
Hurry up! Your goalpost is empty!

00:59:27.583 --> 00:59:31.583
The ball's flying high! So high!
What's going on?

00:59:31.666 --> 00:59:33.625
-Oh, my God!
-They scored.

00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:35.541
Where's the goalie?

00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:37.583
That's you, Dro.

00:59:39.916 --> 00:59:42.291
Sorry, Kas. It was on purpose.

00:59:52.708 --> 00:59:56.750
Korea starts gaining momentum,

00:59:56.833 --> 01:00:00.333
but Indonesia's determination to win
hasn't wavered.

01:00:00.416 --> 01:00:04.083
Indonesia is back on the attack,
BP takes the ball smoothly.

01:00:07.291 --> 01:00:10.291
BP breaks through the defense alone!

01:00:10.375 --> 01:00:12.541
He got past three players!

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:18.250
Now he's one-on-one with the goalkeeper.
He's going for the kick!

01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:19.458
For Indonesia.

01:00:21.208 --> 01:00:23.416
Ouch!

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:36.500
Kas, what's wrong?

01:00:36.583 --> 01:00:38.458
-Code?
-The code!

01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:40.708
The code!

01:00:40.791 --> 01:00:42.125
-The code?
-What code?

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:44.750
I know.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.833
Medic!

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.083
Over here.

01:00:51.166 --> 01:00:53.666
Gosh. I'm getting dizzy.

01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:58.166
Kas. Kasino!

01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:02.583
-My leg feels numb!
-Kas!

01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:05.208
Why are you here?

01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:06.791
What about yourself?

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:08.833
You've been a let down!

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.541
-Let me tell you.
-What?

01:01:16.083 --> 01:01:18.875
-Cut the nonsense, Kas.
-You don't trust me?

01:01:18.958 --> 01:01:20.875
-Ask Dono.
-Is it true?

01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:24.833
How would I know? Only Kasino saw it.

01:01:24.916 --> 01:01:27.375
Please, you were just with me earlier.

01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:31.000
But it was only you who saw it.

01:01:32.083 --> 01:01:34.083
You want a taste of these hands?

01:01:34.166 --> 01:01:35.583
Don't fight.

01:01:35.666 --> 01:01:37.708
Fine, I'll look into it.

01:01:38.375 --> 01:01:42.583
But if there's no evidence,
you better be ready to face the commander.

01:01:44.666 --> 01:01:47.291
-Commander, this is Minati reporting.
-What?

01:01:48.916 --> 01:01:50.458
You're sure about this, right?

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.291
Yeah.

01:01:54.416 --> 01:01:57.125
Or am I? Maybe I saw it wrong.

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:59.083
What?

01:01:59.166 --> 01:02:02.083
Kas! Your eyes are working, right?

01:02:03.666 --> 01:02:08.458
Looks like West Korea
is making a substitution.

01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:13.000
And not just one,
but three players at once!

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.166
This is bad!

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:21.250
Don't worry about it.

01:02:21.333 --> 01:02:23.833
You two stay focused on the mission.

01:02:23.916 --> 01:02:25.958
I'll deal with this rookie.

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:37.000
What the hell? Do they even know
how to play soccer?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.250
We're not playing tag!

01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:41.875
Don, help me!

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:44.458
Indro! Hey! Don't just stand there!

01:02:51.375 --> 01:02:54.416
That's the ball! Why are you chasing me?

01:03:02.416 --> 01:03:04.083
INDONESIA
WORLD CUP IS A MUST

01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:07.875
Now you're chasing me?

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:09.708
Help!

01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:12.166
Missed me.

01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:17.416
You missed.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.916
It's a knockout. Time to run.

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:34.500
A miscommunication.

01:03:34.583 --> 01:03:38.000
Indonesia seizes the ball,
a clean play and…

01:03:38.083 --> 01:03:39.791
Goal!

01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:45.166
Garuda leads again. The spark is back,
they're feeling the momentum again.

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:46.375
And he scores!

01:03:51.916 --> 01:03:53.833
Goal!

01:03:53.916 --> 01:03:55.916
PRESS TO SCORE A GOAL

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:06.125
What a turnaround! Indonesia is back!

01:04:06.208 --> 01:04:08.416
No mercy, no holding back!

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.458
General. Come here.

01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:14.458
Deal with them.

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:16.208
Yes, sir.

01:04:21.875 --> 01:04:22.916
Come on, run.

01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:29.041
Hey, come back here.

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:31.166
Look, it's my mom.

01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:36.458
Mommy.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.708
Mommy.

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:42.625
That's my mom.

01:04:42.708 --> 01:04:45.375
Mommy.

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:58.375
Mommy!

01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:06.125
Death or victory?

01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:23.125
The whistle's blown, the match resumes.

01:05:23.208 --> 01:05:25.166
West Korea now controls the ball.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:28.833
The player who was in tears earlier
takes the shot!

01:05:28.916 --> 01:05:33.875
It's straight to the goal! Paid in full,
no cashback from West Korea!

01:05:38.958 --> 01:05:40.291
It's safe, Commander.

01:05:45.166 --> 01:05:49.875
Min, do you trust their report?

01:05:49.958 --> 01:05:54.708
If those three idiots made a mistake,

01:05:55.916 --> 01:05:59.083
it won't just be their heads,

01:05:59.916 --> 01:06:03.041
Chiips itself could be…

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.500
Hold on, Commander.

01:06:05.833 --> 01:06:07.666
We're doomed.

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:09.750
The end is near.

01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:25.625
And another goal!

01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:31.208
What is this? West Korea
is playing like madmen!

01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:33.750
I feel bad for the others.

01:06:34.666 --> 01:06:36.375
Does it have to be this way?

01:06:54.041 --> 01:06:55.083
Kasino!

01:06:57.791 --> 01:06:59.250
-Kasino!
-A girl's voice?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.291
Right.

01:07:01.375 --> 01:07:02.708
IT'S ALL UNDER CONTROL

01:07:02.791 --> 01:07:03.833
Under control?

01:07:04.791 --> 01:07:07.166
"Now finish them. Good luck."

01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:12.041
Okay!

01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:16.333
Everyone, gather around!

01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:18.791
What now?

01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:20.583
What?

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.250
We can't mess around anymore.

01:07:23.791 --> 01:07:26.083
We? It's just you and your friends.

01:07:26.166 --> 01:07:30.041
Let it go. It's behind us now.

01:07:30.125 --> 01:07:31.791
Don't you guys want to win?

01:07:32.541 --> 01:07:34.958
-Of course.
-Anyone else?

01:07:36.083 --> 01:07:37.250
We do.

01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:41.625
It sounds like you're unsure.
Do you want it or not?

01:07:41.708 --> 01:07:43.750
Yes, we do.

01:07:43.833 --> 01:07:46.208
Seriously, do you want it or not?

01:07:46.291 --> 01:07:48.250
Yes, we do!

01:07:48.333 --> 01:07:50.666
Again, do you want it or not?

01:07:51.166 --> 01:07:52.583
Yes, we do!

01:07:52.666 --> 01:07:54.708
That's the spirit.

01:07:55.458 --> 01:07:58.625
Back to plan A. Let's crush them!

01:08:08.541 --> 01:08:09.375
Sorry.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:10.833
Let's go!

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.125
Rapid attack from Maradono,

01:08:14.208 --> 01:08:18.250
cutting through West Korea's defense,
completely unstoppable!

01:08:25.458 --> 01:08:29.875
A daring run by Maradono
continues with a direct shot…

01:08:34.333 --> 01:08:38.833
Unfortunately, the goalie
was ready for it!

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:52.833
And Maradono scores!

01:08:52.916 --> 01:08:55.791
A goal full of flair and surprise!

01:09:02.083 --> 01:09:04.958
-Excuse me.
-Kasino snatched the ball!

01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:12.041
Twist them.

01:09:25.875 --> 01:09:28.166
Take that, so cute it hurts.

01:09:31.791 --> 01:09:35.083
It's the final minutes on the clock.

01:09:35.166 --> 01:09:39.458
But the referee
has just added three more minutes.

01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:43.750
It's not over yet!
Come on, Garuda. Triumph!

01:09:49.208 --> 01:09:50.250
What is that?

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:54.250
Where are the defenders?

01:09:55.041 --> 01:09:58.000
Gosh. They're gonna score.

01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:01.416
Hey, someone help!

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:05.250
A sudden strike from West Korea
exposes Indonesia's defense.

01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:08.958
This is getting scary, please don't score!

01:10:09.041 --> 01:10:10.125
What now?

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:17.375
A desperate and risky tackle from BP.

01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:20.666
Let's hope it's not a penalty
or a red card.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:26.791
What a tragic error
at such a critical moment.

01:10:26.875 --> 01:10:30.541
And it happened.
A red card from the referee.

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:32.666
BP. Thanks a lot.

01:10:33.666 --> 01:10:34.708
I was so nervous.

01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:37.958
A huge loss at a critical moment.

01:10:38.041 --> 01:10:39.666
BP is out.

01:10:44.291 --> 01:10:47.708
It's unfortunate at a time like this.

01:10:47.791 --> 01:10:52.750
Without Budi Pekerti,
things look grim for Indonesia.

01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:58.125
From the bottom of my heart,

01:10:59.333 --> 01:11:02.791
thank you, BP. Thank you, Budi.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:09.750
The ball is set at the penalty mark.

01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:14.333
Stand tall, Indonesia.
Don't let BP's sacrifice go to waste.

01:11:14.416 --> 01:11:18.416
Indronaldo, our hopes
rest on your shoulders.

01:11:33.583 --> 01:11:36.083
What a bold move by Indronaldo!

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:41.041
He sends it flying straight toward
the opponent's goal.

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:43.583
Is this the hope we've been waiting for?

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.958
Will victory finally be ours?

01:11:46.041 --> 01:11:47.625
This is our last chance.

01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:50.041
With this ball, I will make history.

01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:53.208
The ball is a friend.
Friends fill the void.

01:11:53.291 --> 01:11:56.375
Wherever you might be…

01:11:56.458 --> 01:11:58.291
Don, hurry up and kick it!

01:11:58.375 --> 01:12:00.916
Don't go into slow motion. Time's ticking.

01:12:01.625 --> 01:12:02.958
Okay!

01:12:03.041 --> 01:12:08.875
Take this, Cisewu Tiger Kick!

01:12:18.458 --> 01:12:19.666
Ouch!

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:21.166
What just happened?

01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:24.833
That breathtaking flip-kick
couldn't pass into the net!

01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:26.500
What a shame.

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:32.000
Now that's a faceplant.

01:12:32.541 --> 01:12:34.041
He passed out?

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:52.875
The ref's ready to call it…

01:12:52.958 --> 01:12:54.125
But what's this?

01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:56.708
A wave of grass
is heading toward the ball!

01:12:56.791 --> 01:12:58.666
Could this change everything?

01:13:02.916 --> 01:13:04.166
It went in.

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:05.125
It went in!

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:12.375
Indonesia scores at the last minute!

01:13:16.791 --> 01:13:21.333
Amazing! And there's the final whistle.

01:13:21.416 --> 01:13:22.750
Congratulations, Indonesia!

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:24.833
Yes! We win, Commander!

01:13:26.833 --> 01:13:29.250
It's all part of my plan, Minati.

01:13:47.958 --> 01:13:49.333
Don, Kas, look!

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:05.416
I told you
we'd come out of this as heroes.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.333
I believed you from the start.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.291
Say hello to the World Cup!

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:45.083
I'm Dono, the unstoppable scoring machine.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.625
I'm Kasino, team leader and coordinator.

01:14:58.916 --> 01:15:02.833
I'm Indro,
the guardian of this sacred goal.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:07.666
We eat Somay Sausages!

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:11.458
SOMAY SAUSAGE

01:15:13.333 --> 01:15:15.416
Go ahead, drink up.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.125
But if there's no evidence,
you better be ready to face the commander.

01:15:20.208 --> 01:15:22.958
Brats! What are you doing there? Get down!

01:15:23.041 --> 01:15:24.791
Sharing is caring, right?

01:15:26.041 --> 01:15:27.083
Right?

01:15:27.166 --> 01:15:30.416
That raises the question,
what will the government do

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.208
to combat this situation?
