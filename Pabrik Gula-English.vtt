1
00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:28.750
So, how is it?

2
00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:31.208
Hang on. The radiator is still too hot.

3
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:33.666
Hurry up. We're late already.

4
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.083
I'll get scolded by the factory people!

5
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.833
-Come on, hurry up! Fix it quickly!
-Yes, sir.

6
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.458
Come on!

7
00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:50.708
Get on!

8
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:51.875
Chop-chop!

9
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.250
Come on, hurry! We're late! Come on!

10
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.666
Wait!

11
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.083
How could you leave the leader behind?

12
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.500
Come on.

13
00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:02.791
Wait, sir.

14
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:06.541
-Thank you.
-Fadhil, come here.

15
00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:07.708
Okay.

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.458
Just stand here.

17
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:13.666
Naning, I'm standing next to you, okay?

18
00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:17.250
If you feel sleepy,

19
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.041
you can rest your head
on my strong shoulder.

20
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.541
Okay?

21
00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.541
My shoulder was made just for you.

22
00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:28.125
Naning, don't turn down his offer.

23
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:31.625
This is your chance
to lean on an ancient statue.

24
00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.875
-What did you say?
-I'm helping you.

25
00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:37.833
-Wati!
-Come on!

26
00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:41.500
Wait for me! Wait, sir!

27
00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:42.875
Wait for me.

28
00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.291
Hendra, help me.

29
00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.500
-You're coming?
-I am.

30
00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:48.875
-In God's name.
-Your mother gave her blessing?

31
00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.000
She finally did.

32
00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:53.375
I convinced Mother
that I wanted to help you out.

33
00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:58.416
We're the ones getting married.
I want to contribute to the cost.

34
00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:01.500
Okay, then. Give that to me.

35
00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:02.708
Honey!

36
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.625
Your hand.

37
00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:06.916
What?

38
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.250
I know that smile.

39
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.875
Now that your fiancée is coming.

40
00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:15.458
You must have dirty plans.

41
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:18.458
I suspect you two are going to--

42
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:20.791
-Do some cowboy camping.
-What the…

43
00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:22.500
Shut your mouth!

44
00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:24.500
You don't get it. Don't butt in.

45
00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:25.916
Going to sleep around?

46
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.291
Watch your mouth!

47
00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:29.750
-Honey, stop it.
-I'll put you to sleep!

48
00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:31.666
Naning…

49
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.833
Stop it.

50
00:02:32.916 --> 00:02:34.583
Be careful, Naning.

51
00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:36.041
Not me!

52
00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:37.875
-Let's pray.
-It was Endah.

53
00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:41.791
Pray first.

54
00:02:53.166 --> 00:03:00.166
EAST JAVA, 2003

55
00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:18.583
Damn it!

56
00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:20.125
You're drooling!

57
00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:22.583
Your drool smells rancid.

58
00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:24.291
Why are you wiping it on me? Hey!

59
00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:25.750
Calm down, will you?

60
00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:29.875
Calm down? He's drooling all over me
and it smells like a corpse.

61
00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958
Just ignore it.

62
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:33.208
Don't overreact, Franky.

63
00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:35.916
I'll have to burn this shirt.

64
00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:40.166
Is that the factory?

65
00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:51.166
Yes, that's the factory.

66
00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.916
It's unlike the ones on TV.

67
00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:56.208
Don't believe TV commercials.

68
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:57.916
This is the real thing.

69
00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.500
Those who have received
their lodge numbers,

70
00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:44.125
go straight to your assigned rooms.

71
00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:51.333
Dinner's ready.

72
00:06:51.416 --> 00:06:53.583
Finally!

73
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:57.875
Hey, miss. Come, join us.

74
00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:58.958
-It's okay.
-Sit.

75
00:06:59.041 --> 00:07:02.500
It's fine. There's plenty of food.
I'll get another plate.

76
00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:03.625
Thanks.

77
00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:05.291
Don't mention it.

78
00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:07.708
We haven't been introduced.

79
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:10.041
-I'm Endah.
-I'm Rani.

80
00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:13.125
Nice to meet you, Rani.

81
00:07:13.208 --> 00:07:14.208
Rani.

82
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:16.583
I'm Naning. Please don't be shy around us.

83
00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:17.875
That's right.

84
00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.625
I'm Wati.

85
00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:22.208
The three of us
come from the same village.

86
00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:33.583
What is that sound?

87
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.916
I think it's the alarm to go to bed.
It was explained earlier.

88
00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:49.666
Endah, what are you looking at?

89
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.166
Let's eat.

90
00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:54.875
Come on.

91
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.083
Let's eat, Endah.

92
00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:00.375
Fine, I'm coming.

93
00:09:17.416 --> 00:09:18.833
Oh, my God.

94
00:10:27.916 --> 00:10:29.083
Wati?

95
00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:32.875
Naning?

96
00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:37.166
Rani?

97
00:16:53.083 --> 00:16:54.250
I'm leaving, Wati.

98
00:16:54.333 --> 00:16:55.333
-Okay.
-See you.

99
00:16:55.416 --> 00:16:56.541
Take care.

100
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.875
Wati, where's Naning?

101
00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.083
That's the thing.

102
00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:06.333
Naning!

103
00:17:06.416 --> 00:17:08.333
Naning, don't take too long!

104
00:17:08.416 --> 00:17:10.166
Or else we'll be late!

105
00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:13.625
Yes. Coming.

106
00:17:13.708 --> 00:17:15.666
How pretty.

107
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.041
But of course.

108
00:17:17.125 --> 00:17:19.416
Who knows? Might meet the one here.

109
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.833
Only you can think like that.

110
00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.250
Come on, then.

111
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:26.125
Cover up.

112
00:17:26.208 --> 00:17:30.333
Naning, Wati,
either of you went out last night?

113
00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:31.541
No.

114
00:17:31.625 --> 00:17:33.958
Nope. Slept like a baby.

115
00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:36.000
Why do you ask?

116
00:17:36.083 --> 00:17:37.250
Nothing.

117
00:17:38.166 --> 00:17:40.500
I heard someone opening the door.

118
00:17:40.583 --> 00:17:42.583
I thought someone left our lodge.

119
00:17:42.666 --> 00:17:44.208
I must have heard wrong.

120
00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:48.791
Peace be upon you.

121
00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:50.708
Naning.

122
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:52.875
You look so cute this morning.

123
00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.625
Just like me when I was a baby.

124
00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:58.666
For those who arrived late yesterday,
I'm Marni.

125
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.833
I'm in charge of the seasonal workers
at this factory.

126
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.125
This is Mr. Samin.

127
00:18:06.791 --> 00:18:11.791
We also have Rano and Karno,
the security guards here.

128
00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:17.000
And the foremen
who will oversee your work.

129
00:18:18.125 --> 00:18:21.500
I must tell you about the curfew.

130
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.208
You must've heard it last night.

131
00:18:25.791 --> 00:18:29.875
The sound of the slit drum after dusk

132
00:18:30.708 --> 00:18:33.541
signifies the beginning
of the yellow hours.

133
00:18:34.333 --> 00:18:35.750
During the yellow hours,

134
00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:41.333
all workers have to be within
the vicinity of their respective lodges.

135
00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:47.750
And the sound of the steam whistle
at 9:00 p.m.

136
00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:52.083
signifies the beginning of the red hours.

137
00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:55.333
During the red hours,

138
00:18:55.416 --> 00:19:00.333
you are not allowed
to leave your lodges at all.

139
00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:06.416
Keep this rule without any exception.

140
00:19:09.125 --> 00:19:12.625
In three days, the milling will start.

141
00:19:13.458 --> 00:19:19.416
Now, please go with the foremen
as they call your name.

142
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.041
The explanation about your tasks
will be given at each post.

143
00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:28.291
Understand?

144
00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:30.750
-Let's start.
-Yes, ma'am.

145
00:19:30.833 --> 00:19:32.750
Listen carefully, all of you.

146
00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:34.208
Listen for your name.

147
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.708
Andi Bintaro.

148
00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:38.625
Sarwendah!

149
00:19:38.708 --> 00:19:39.708
Reno!

150
00:19:39.791 --> 00:19:41.333
Where's Sarwendah?

151
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.458
Mulyono Suparji.

152
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.541
Are you Mulyono?

153
00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:51.125
He's Mulyono Suparji,
son of an anchovy farmer.

154
00:19:51.208 --> 00:19:53.666
-Mackerel.
-Son of a mackerel farmer, sir.

155
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.916
Come here.

156
00:19:59.375 --> 00:20:01.041
Dwi Adrianto.

157
00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:03.416
-Me, sir.
-Sir…

158
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.958
Just call me Franky.

159
00:20:05.666 --> 00:20:07.166
Mul-yo-no.

160
00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:12.666
Come with me to the office.

161
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:18.791
Angga.

162
00:20:19.416 --> 00:20:20.791
Hendra.

163
00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:21.916
Noval.

164
00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:24.583
Muhammad Fadhil.

165
00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:32.625
You will work in my office.

166
00:20:32.708 --> 00:20:35.375
I'll explain your tasks to you. Okay?

167
00:20:35.458 --> 00:20:36.458
Okay.

168
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.541
-Go on.
-Forward!

169
00:22:51.333 --> 00:22:52.791
Good deeds

170
00:22:54.333 --> 00:22:56.625
will bring you good rewards.

171
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Oh, my God!

172
00:23:41.458 --> 00:23:42.916
Oh, my God!

173
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:55.375
Do you know, Dil?

174
00:23:56.083 --> 00:23:57.458
This factory

175
00:23:58.458 --> 00:23:59.916
caught on fire once.

176
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.250
Where did you hear that?

177
00:24:04.333 --> 00:24:05.791
Franky told me.

178
00:24:06.958 --> 00:24:08.125
Really?

179
00:24:08.208 --> 00:24:09.958
Hang on.

180
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:11.750
You all don't believe me?

181
00:24:15.041 --> 00:24:16.375
It happened…

182
00:24:17.083 --> 00:24:18.583
Seven years ago.

183
00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:21.916
A big fire at the warehouse.

184
00:24:22.583 --> 00:24:24.500
Everyone who was trapped…

185
00:24:24.583 --> 00:24:27.083
Died. Perished.

186
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.291
They were all seasonal workers?

187
00:24:29.375 --> 00:24:30.750
That's right, Eko.

188
00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:32.750
It was because

189
00:24:33.625 --> 00:24:37.041
they wandered outside at night.

190
00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:41.791
They were drunk.

191
00:24:41.875 --> 00:24:42.958
Intoxicated.

192
00:24:43.875 --> 00:24:46.083
How do you know they were drunk?

193
00:24:46.708 --> 00:24:48.333
That's what the rumors say.

194
00:24:48.875 --> 00:24:51.375
The warehouse was suddenly locked.

195
00:24:51.458 --> 00:24:53.625
And there was a big explosion. Boom!

196
00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:55.458
Bang!

197
00:24:55.541 --> 00:24:56.541
Boom!

198
00:24:59.166 --> 00:25:02.583
Everyone tried to escape,
but they couldn't.

199
00:25:04.541 --> 00:25:06.166
The fire started to spread.

200
00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:11.125
Those inside were burned alive.

201
00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:13.791
They screamed.

202
00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:17.583
"It's hot!"

203
00:25:20.125 --> 00:25:21.625
After the incident,

204
00:25:22.916 --> 00:25:25.916
the yellow and red hour rules
were implemented.

205
00:25:30.583 --> 00:25:31.750
Rumor has it,

206
00:25:32.541 --> 00:25:33.833
every night

207
00:25:35.791 --> 00:25:38.208
their spirits wander around the factory.

208
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:40.958
"Hot."

209
00:25:42.083 --> 00:25:43.791
"Hot."

210
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.166
"Hot."

211
00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:49.250
Nonsense!

212
00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:50.375
Wait.

213
00:25:50.458 --> 00:25:51.625
Why are you mad?

214
00:25:51.708 --> 00:25:54.083
Hey, where are you going?

215
00:25:54.166 --> 00:25:57.458
Why are you running away? Boo! Coward!

216
00:25:58.125 --> 00:25:59.208
Hendra!

217
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.166
-Damn you!
-Scared, huh?

218
00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:32.375
Rani?

219
00:27:36.791 --> 00:27:37.958
Rani?

220
00:27:40.791 --> 00:27:41.791
Rani?

221
00:27:47.208 --> 00:27:49.000
Rani, what are you doing here?

222
00:27:58.208 --> 00:27:59.833
Rani, I have a question.

223
00:28:01.875 --> 00:28:03.875
What do you want to ask?

224
00:28:07.458 --> 00:28:08.583
Last night,

225
00:28:09.291 --> 00:28:11.083
did you slip out of the lodge?

226
00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:49.291
Go back to your lodge and get some rest.

227
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.083
Endah? What's going on?

228
00:28:57.625 --> 00:28:59.041
What happened?

229
00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:00.333
Endah?

230
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.625
Let's go back.

231
00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:09.083
Rani, just come with us.

232
00:29:15.583 --> 00:29:17.666
Who wouldn't want to work at this factory?

233
00:29:18.375 --> 00:29:19.708
Big salary.

234
00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.250
And we get a place to stay.

235
00:29:24.333 --> 00:29:25.500
Right.

236
00:29:25.583 --> 00:29:29.083
But the locals
don't want to work here anymore.

237
00:29:29.833 --> 00:29:33.000
That's why the factory
hires people from other cities.

238
00:29:33.083 --> 00:29:34.625
Like you guys.

239
00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:41.125
Because of the ghost sightings?

240
00:29:46.708 --> 00:29:47.750
Yes.

241
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.958
The spirits of the fire victims.

242
00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:58.000
But there's something even scarier.

243
00:29:58.875 --> 00:30:02.666
Back in colonial times,
this factory had everything.

244
00:30:03.541 --> 00:30:06.208
Tennis court, they had it.

245
00:30:06.291 --> 00:30:07.958
-School.
-They had it.

246
00:30:08.041 --> 00:30:10.041
-Barbershop?
-They had it.

247
00:30:10.125 --> 00:30:12.083
-Beggars that walked backwards?
-Sure.

248
00:30:12.166 --> 00:30:14.875
It's common at a sugar factory.
What else, Franky?

249
00:30:14.958 --> 00:30:16.583
I was just asking.

250
00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:23.208
Mental hospital? They had it.

251
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:25.458
-What for?
-For your friend here.

252
00:30:28.291 --> 00:30:29.291
Go on.

253
00:30:32.083 --> 00:30:33.416
But rumor has it,

254
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:35.958
at this hour,

255
00:30:37.791 --> 00:30:40.000
a spirit wanders around.

256
00:30:40.875 --> 00:30:43.291
A mental hospital patient.

257
00:30:45.125 --> 00:30:46.833
She always appears

258
00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:49.333
with her back to us.

259
00:30:51.666 --> 00:30:53.666
If we turn our back and run away,

260
00:30:54.708 --> 00:30:56.833
she will reappear in front of us.

261
00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:01.375
If we run away again, she will reappear.

262
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:03.833
If we run away again…

263
00:31:03.916 --> 00:31:05.291
She will reappear.

264
00:31:05.375 --> 00:31:06.541
Hang on.

265
00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:08.666
She will reappear.

266
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.375
What should we do then?

267
00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:17.000
You have to politely say…

268
00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:19.958
"Excuse me."

269
00:31:20.041 --> 00:31:21.583
Only then will she leave.

270
00:31:22.208 --> 00:31:25.541
Hear that?
Even a ghost appreciates courtesy.

271
00:31:25.625 --> 00:31:26.833
Enough!

272
00:31:26.916 --> 00:31:28.250
Go back to your lodge.

273
00:31:28.333 --> 00:31:29.875
It's almost 9:00 p.m.

274
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.500
Red hour.

275
00:31:33.833 --> 00:31:36.041
Time for the spirits to wander about.

276
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.208
Don't forget.

277
00:31:39.916 --> 00:31:41.083
"Excuse me."

278
00:31:41.875 --> 00:31:43.125
"Excuse me."

279
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.541
Excuse me.

280
00:31:51.333 --> 00:31:52.875
I'm not the ghost!

281
00:31:55.083 --> 00:31:56.125
Dwi!

282
00:32:05.208 --> 00:32:06.291
Dwi!

283
00:32:08.333 --> 00:32:09.625
What's the hurry?

284
00:32:11.375 --> 00:32:12.416
Come on!

285
00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:17.208
You must've been circumcised by a jinn
when you were little.

286
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.583
Coward!

287
00:32:20.791 --> 00:32:22.000
Don't be so slow.

288
00:32:23.916 --> 00:32:25.125
Look at me.

289
00:32:25.958 --> 00:32:27.666
Calm and relaxed.

290
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:30.291
In control of any situation.

291
00:32:31.875 --> 00:32:33.291
Hurry up, Franky!

292
00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:52.625
Mulyono, wait!

293
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.208
Franky!

294
00:32:56.333 --> 00:32:59.166
Don't leave me, Franky!

295
00:33:14.291 --> 00:33:16.791
Mulyono! Franky! Open!

296
00:33:21.791 --> 00:33:23.833
What are you thinking about, Wati?

297
00:33:26.666 --> 00:33:27.833
Hendra.

298
00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:32.583
Is he burdened by my mother's request?

299
00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:36.750
I feel bad.

300
00:33:39.875 --> 00:33:42.916
Maybe I should postpone the wedding.

301
00:33:44.125 --> 00:33:45.375
I wouldn't feel good

302
00:33:45.916 --> 00:33:47.833
if he paid for everything.

303
00:33:50.583 --> 00:33:53.416
What would you do if you were me, Naning?

304
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.625
If it was me,

305
00:33:54.708 --> 00:33:57.833
if I wasn't financially ready,
I wouldn't get married.

306
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.375
But that's me.

307
00:34:01.458 --> 00:34:03.541
-Where are you going?
-The bathroom.

308
00:34:03.625 --> 00:34:04.708
-Wanna come?
-No.

309
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:05.833
"No."

310
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.625
What would you do if you were me, Endah?

311
00:34:21.833 --> 00:34:23.041
Endah?

312
00:34:26.583 --> 00:34:27.708
Endah?

313
00:34:29.125 --> 00:34:30.291
Endah?

314
00:34:31.625 --> 00:34:33.250
You've been daydreaming.

315
00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:36.458
What did you say, Wati?

316
00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:38.541
Are you okay?

317
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:43.875
Endah, if something happened,
don't keep it to yourself.

318
00:34:43.958 --> 00:34:47.166
Naning and I are here. Tell us. Okay?

319
00:34:49.166 --> 00:34:50.500
I'm okay.

320
00:34:53.416 --> 00:34:55.500
What were you saying about your wedding?

321
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.750
What's going on?

322
00:36:46.916 --> 00:36:47.916
It's dark.

323
00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:49.541
The light went out.

324
00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:52.750
It did?

325
00:36:55.333 --> 00:36:56.416
It's fine.

326
00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:01.750
In the name of Allah.

327
00:39:12.791 --> 00:39:13.791
Help.

328
00:39:31.291 --> 00:39:34.625
Last night I heard Hendra…

329
00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:37.708
Did you ask him?

330
00:39:37.791 --> 00:39:39.875
-Should I?
-Ask him.

331
00:39:39.958 --> 00:39:41.166
Hendra.

332
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.541
-What?
-Were you dreaming last night?

333
00:39:43.625 --> 00:39:45.750
I heard you talking in your sleep.

334
00:39:45.833 --> 00:39:47.541
You heard it?

335
00:39:47.625 --> 00:39:49.875
I had a nightmare.

336
00:39:51.708 --> 00:39:53.791
Couldn't go back to sleep?

337
00:39:53.875 --> 00:39:55.250
I couldn't.

338
00:39:56.375 --> 00:39:57.875
What did you dream about?

339
00:39:59.916 --> 00:40:00.958
It was unclear.

340
00:40:01.833 --> 00:40:03.625
Tell me about it.

341
00:40:06.291 --> 00:40:09.708
-Answer me, what did you dream about?
-Forget about it!

342
00:40:09.791 --> 00:40:10.958
I'm fine.

343
00:40:11.958 --> 00:40:13.333
Stop nagging.

344
00:40:14.083 --> 00:40:15.500
It's embarrassing.

345
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.000
We are here to work. That's it!

346
00:40:23.875 --> 00:40:26.041
Don't listen to him.

347
00:40:26.625 --> 00:40:27.750
It's fine, Wati.

348
00:40:28.958 --> 00:40:33.666
Wati, it was just a dream.

349
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.458
Don't make too much of it.

350
00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:38.458
You're wrong.

351
00:40:39.208 --> 00:40:41.416
I can't stop thinking about my dream.

352
00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:45.791
Because it was a beautiful dream.

353
00:40:46.416 --> 00:40:48.625
I dreamed about marrying Naning.

354
00:40:49.416 --> 00:40:51.541
It was beautiful for you.

355
00:40:51.625 --> 00:40:53.250
For me, it's…

356
00:40:53.333 --> 00:40:54.750
-What?
-Happy?

357
00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:56.000
Horrible!

358
00:41:01.291 --> 00:41:04.708
Franky, from now on, don't sleep again.

359
00:41:04.791 --> 00:41:05.958
I feel for Naning.

360
00:41:06.875 --> 00:41:09.000
Do you want me to die quickly, Dwi?

361
00:41:09.083 --> 00:41:10.625
Not too quickly.

362
00:41:10.708 --> 00:41:11.958
Do it slowly.

363
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:13.750
So we can be prepared.

364
00:41:13.833 --> 00:41:16.250
Prepared, huh?

365
00:41:16.333 --> 00:41:17.583
Let me check.

366
00:41:24.125 --> 00:41:25.125
This one.

367
00:41:25.666 --> 00:41:27.583
Bring it to the weigh station.

368
00:41:27.666 --> 00:41:28.916
Yes, sir.

369
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.541
-Thank you, sir.
-Okay.

370
00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:35.583
Endah.

371
00:41:35.666 --> 00:41:37.083
Hey, Rani.

372
00:41:37.166 --> 00:41:38.375
Where are you going?

373
00:41:38.458 --> 00:41:42.166
To deliver documents to the crane station
and the weigh station.

374
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.500
Let me help you.

375
00:41:43.583 --> 00:41:45.791
I'm on my way to the weigh station.

376
00:41:45.875 --> 00:41:47.750
It's okay, Rani, I can do it myself.

377
00:41:47.833 --> 00:41:50.000
It's okay. I'm heading there anyway.

378
00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:52.083
Okay, then.

379
00:41:52.875 --> 00:41:54.208
-Thanks.
-Yes.

380
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:55.708
-See you.
-Take care.

381
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.291
Rani!

382
00:42:37.416 --> 00:42:38.458
Rani!

383
00:42:39.041 --> 00:42:40.166
Rani!

384
00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:44.708
Rani!

385
00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:46.250
Rani!

386
00:42:48.375 --> 00:42:49.333
Rani!

387
00:42:50.166 --> 00:42:51.416
Rani!

388
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.541
Rani!

389
00:43:01.375 --> 00:43:03.666
Rani!

390
00:43:13.583 --> 00:43:16.125
Why didn't you bring
the document yourself?

391
00:43:16.208 --> 00:43:17.583
That was your job!

392
00:43:18.583 --> 00:43:20.000
I'm sorry, ma'am.

393
00:43:21.083 --> 00:43:23.958
Rani offered to help.

394
00:43:24.041 --> 00:43:25.833
What's wrong with you?

395
00:43:28.375 --> 00:43:31.666
I'm sorry, ma'am. It's my fault.

396
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.416
Forgive me, ma'am.

397
00:43:36.375 --> 00:43:37.583
Now what?

398
00:43:43.583 --> 00:43:44.666
What is it?

399
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:45.875
Ma'am.

400
00:43:45.958 --> 00:43:48.541
Shouldn't we postpone the milling?

401
00:43:49.541 --> 00:43:50.875
We can't.

402
00:43:50.958 --> 00:43:54.333
I just reported to the higher-ups
that everything is on track.

403
00:43:54.416 --> 00:43:56.458
How can I ask for a postponement?

404
00:43:56.541 --> 00:43:59.166
I need a little bit of time.

405
00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:03.916
Jinah and I need to make sure
this is a normal work accident.

406
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.583
The next Legi day is not until next week.

407
00:44:06.666 --> 00:44:09.250
If we postpone, the loss will be too big.

408
00:44:11.125 --> 00:44:13.333
I'm sorry. It's out of the question.

409
00:44:16.458 --> 00:44:18.041
This is too risky.

410
00:45:04.791 --> 00:45:06.541
I think my hunch was right.

411
00:45:07.625 --> 00:45:09.708
It wasn't a normal accident.

412
00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:12.750
Calm yourself.

413
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.625
This afternoon,
we have to prepare the offering ceremony.

414
00:45:22.416 --> 00:45:26.625
What do you think made them angry?

415
00:45:30.166 --> 00:45:31.375
I have no idea.

416
00:45:33.833 --> 00:45:35.166
All I know is

417
00:45:35.791 --> 00:45:38.500
we need to be calm in handling this.

418
00:45:55.625 --> 00:45:56.666
Endah.

419
00:45:58.916 --> 00:46:00.291
Are you okay, Endah?

420
00:46:02.791 --> 00:46:05.208
I heard about the accident.

421
00:46:07.416 --> 00:46:08.666
I'm scared.

422
00:46:10.833 --> 00:46:13.375
I'm afraid that
it wasn't a normal accident.

423
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.083
What do you mean?

424
00:46:16.625 --> 00:46:17.666
To be honest,

425
00:46:19.458 --> 00:46:22.041
I've been experiencing
strange things here.

426
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.916
On our first night here,

427
00:46:25.458 --> 00:46:28.125
I went out of the lodge
during the red hours.

428
00:46:29.416 --> 00:46:31.708
Oh, dear. Does Mrs. Marni know?

429
00:46:33.833 --> 00:46:37.625
No one knows except you.
I don't want to get fired.

430
00:46:40.458 --> 00:46:41.458
Endah…

431
00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:44.666
that night, who were you with?

432
00:46:47.625 --> 00:46:49.208
I followed someone

433
00:46:50.291 --> 00:46:52.750
who went out of the lodge to the factory.

434
00:46:54.458 --> 00:46:56.416
But I lost track of that person.

435
00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.708
That night…

436
00:47:01.625 --> 00:47:03.583
I saw a wayang performance.

437
00:47:04.833 --> 00:47:05.875
In the factory?

438
00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:08.541
Are you sure?

439
00:47:14.708 --> 00:47:16.916
I feel like something is off.

440
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:24.208
The accident had nothing to do
with what I saw, right?

441
00:47:24.791 --> 00:47:25.750
Endah.

442
00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:27.291
Calm down.

443
00:47:27.833 --> 00:47:30.041
Right now, you need to calm yourself.

444
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:34.208
Be alert.

445
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.916
Don't forget to pray.

446
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:39.250
Let's hope our offerings are accepted

447
00:48:41.041 --> 00:48:43.041
and there'll be no more accidents.

448
00:48:43.916 --> 00:48:44.916
Yes.

449
00:49:31.333 --> 00:49:32.500
Rani?

450
00:49:39.416 --> 00:49:40.625
Rani?

451
00:49:42.958 --> 00:49:44.291
Rani?

452
00:49:56.708 --> 00:49:57.958
Excuse me.

453
00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:05.208
Rani, I want to apologize.

454
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.958
I'm sorry.

455
00:50:11.666 --> 00:50:13.083
It was my mistake.

456
00:50:15.958 --> 00:50:17.708
How are you feeling?

457
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.500
Endah!

458
00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:05.916
Oh, my God!

459
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Endah.

460
00:51:08.666 --> 00:51:09.958
What happened?

461
00:51:12.833 --> 00:51:14.458
Ask forgiveness from Allah.

462
00:51:21.208 --> 00:51:23.000
Are you feeling guilty, Endah?

463
00:51:26.791 --> 00:51:28.291
Rani is fine.

464
00:51:29.666 --> 00:51:31.333
They've sent her home.

465
00:51:52.083 --> 00:51:53.958
Wati.

466
00:51:54.041 --> 00:51:56.500
Weren't you going to take this to Hendra?

467
00:51:57.875 --> 00:51:59.666
It's almost 9:00 p.m.

468
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:02.041
I haven't put on my hijab.

469
00:52:02.125 --> 00:52:03.875
Let me do it.

470
00:52:03.958 --> 00:52:05.750
-Do you mind?
-No.

471
00:52:05.833 --> 00:52:06.666
Thank you.

472
00:52:12.875 --> 00:52:14.041
Who is it?

473
00:52:20.833 --> 00:52:22.000
Naning.

474
00:52:30.333 --> 00:52:31.791
Is this a dream?

475
00:52:33.875 --> 00:52:35.000
Dwi!

476
00:52:37.541 --> 00:52:38.750
Dwi!

477
00:52:43.708 --> 00:52:45.708
-What is it, Franky?
-Hit me, bro.

478
00:52:47.333 --> 00:52:49.458
Hey! What have you done?

479
00:52:52.416 --> 00:52:53.791
Damn you!

480
00:52:54.916 --> 00:52:56.500
Without any warning?

481
00:52:56.583 --> 00:52:57.458
Again?

482
00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:03.500
But it's okay.

483
00:53:03.583 --> 00:53:05.333
This isn't a dream, then.

484
00:53:06.916 --> 00:53:08.416
Look, Dwi.

485
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.125
My effort is fruitful.

486
00:53:11.208 --> 00:53:12.875
Naning came to see me.

487
00:53:15.041 --> 00:53:16.583
Naning,

488
00:53:16.666 --> 00:53:20.875
I didn't expect you to come to me.

489
00:53:23.458 --> 00:53:26.416
I also didn't expect Naning
to be far-sighted.

490
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:30.708
-I'll poke your eyes out!
-What's going on here?

491
00:53:30.791 --> 00:53:33.416
Here, Wati asked me to bring this to you.

492
00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.125
-Thanks, Naning.
-Okay.

493
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:41.041
Hendra, what do I have to do
to be loved that much?

494
00:53:42.166 --> 00:53:43.916
I lack nothing.

495
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.583
You lack a shower, Franky.

496
00:53:45.666 --> 00:53:47.208
Dirty from head to toe.

497
00:53:52.333 --> 00:53:56.333
Naning, the red hour alarm
will go off soon.

498
00:53:56.416 --> 00:53:59.083
You're not allowed
to be out of your lodge.

499
00:53:59.166 --> 00:54:00.583
Yes. Okay, then.

500
00:54:00.708 --> 00:54:01.708
Hey, Naning.

501
00:54:01.791 --> 00:54:03.208
How is Endah?

502
00:54:04.083 --> 00:54:05.125
She's fine.

503
00:54:05.833 --> 00:54:07.708
-Good night, boys.
-Naning.

504
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:09.750
Let me walk you back.

505
00:54:10.458 --> 00:54:13.000
Take care of that nosebleed,
why don't you?

506
00:54:15.583 --> 00:54:16.791
Hey!

507
00:54:16.875 --> 00:54:18.750
This is not a nosebleed.

508
00:54:18.833 --> 00:54:21.625
This is the snort of a fool in love.

509
00:54:21.708 --> 00:54:22.833
Naning!

510
00:54:23.833 --> 00:54:25.916
Wow, she walks so fast.

511
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:45.333
Wait…

512
00:55:57.333 --> 00:55:58.583
Wait…

513
00:56:01.333 --> 00:56:04.916
What's going on here?
Why didn't they take the offerings?

514
00:56:06.833 --> 00:56:09.291
Looks like we have a ritual to perform.

515
00:56:12.708 --> 00:56:14.666
I have a bad feeling about this.

516
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.583
Aren't you scared, Rano?

517
00:57:24.666 --> 00:57:28.541
Samin and Jinah's offerings
weren't accepted.

518
00:57:28.625 --> 00:57:32.625
Maybe the spirits don't like beef.

519
00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:37.625
They should try the trotters,
it's the best part.

520
00:57:37.708 --> 00:57:40.708
Stop joking about it.
It can bring us bad luck.

521
00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:43.333
A security guard
shouldn't be superstitious.

522
00:57:51.541 --> 00:57:53.958
Who's drawing water this late at night?

523
00:57:55.916 --> 00:57:57.375
Maybe it's Jinah?

524
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:00.000
Jinah!

525
00:58:03.333 --> 00:58:04.458
It must be a ghost.

526
00:58:04.541 --> 00:58:06.083
Damn it!

527
00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:08.375
Your baton!

528
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.375
I'll get it tomorrow!

529
01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:26.166
Oh, my God!

530
01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:27.500
I'm late!

531
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.916
-Rano!
-Let's go.

532
01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:42.208
-Ma'am.
-Where?

533
01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:45.958
Jinah. Samin.

534
01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:16.333
Postpone the milling, ma'am.
Don't do it today.

535
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:21.541
Rano, Karno, come with me.

536
01:01:21.625 --> 01:01:23.125
Yes, ma'am.

537
01:01:23.208 --> 01:01:24.375
Sir.

538
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:52.458
Oh, my God!

539
01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:56.958
Sir.

540
01:02:00.666 --> 01:02:02.291
He's from your village?

541
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.583
No, sir.

542
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:10.166
I think his name is Eko.

543
01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:13.500
Do not cause panic.

544
01:02:23.958 --> 01:02:25.333
Sorry, sir.

545
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:30.708
I don't mean to be impudent,

546
01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:34.125
but how could this happen?

547
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:38.291
Is this your first time here
as a seasonal worker?

548
01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:52.750
You're not an ordinary guy.

549
01:02:55.458 --> 01:02:57.708
What have you experienced here?

550
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:03.208
Don't hide what you know.

551
01:03:04.166 --> 01:03:06.916
It won't help with the situation.

552
01:03:12.916 --> 01:03:14.208
Your hand, child.

553
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.250
Give her your hand.

554
01:03:53.958 --> 01:03:55.958
What did you see that night?

555
01:04:04.791 --> 01:04:06.500
What's going on here, ma'am?

556
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:11.500
Be honest.

557
01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:14.416
So it won't be painful.

558
01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:19.625
It's okay, Endah.

559
01:04:20.375 --> 01:04:22.041
They know.

560
01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:31.166
A wayang show, ma'am.

561
01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.041
Why did you go there?

562
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.750
That night…

563
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.666
I saw someone leave the lodge.

564
01:04:44.833 --> 01:04:46.583
I tried to follow the person.

565
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:49.916
I thought it was one of my friends.

566
01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:53.583
But I lost them.

567
01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:56.291
And then,

568
01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.041
I saw a crowd.

569
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.083
Who was it?

570
01:05:04.958 --> 01:05:06.583
I don't know, ma'am.

571
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.500
I'm sorry, all of you.

572
01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:22.625
Maybe it was Rani?

573
01:05:22.708 --> 01:05:24.833
The worker who met with an accident.

574
01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:30.041
I met Rani after the accident.

575
01:05:31.125 --> 01:05:35.333
She's just another victim
of the spirit's anger.

576
01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:43.583
Actually, the curfew was implemented

577
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:47.416
so the workers don't see them.

578
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:51.083
The inhabitants of this sugar factory.

579
01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:56.166
Just like what you saw
at that wayang show.

580
01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:00.458
But

581
01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:04.541
the reason the workers were harmed…

582
01:06:06.208 --> 01:06:08.416
is not because you saw them.

583
01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:13.791
There's a bigger violation
that we don't know about yet.

584
01:06:25.125 --> 01:06:28.000
You said something about a dream.

585
01:06:28.083 --> 01:06:29.583
What did you see?

586
01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:43.750
Someone with your ability…

587
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.250
their dreams usually reveal something.

588
01:06:48.083 --> 01:06:51.000
Your dream might be a clue.

589
01:06:56.666 --> 01:06:58.541
What did you dream about?

590
01:07:05.625 --> 01:07:07.041
On the first night,

591
01:07:08.833 --> 01:07:10.500
I dreamed…

592
01:07:16.458 --> 01:07:20.375
When Endah said that she left her lodge,

593
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:25.000
I thought it was her in my dream.

594
01:07:28.833 --> 01:07:30.916
Did you go to the west warehouse?

595
01:07:33.541 --> 01:07:34.666
No, ma'am.

596
01:07:36.666 --> 01:07:38.166
I saw the wayang show

597
01:07:39.958 --> 01:07:42.458
in the warehouse
next to the main building.

598
01:07:44.208 --> 01:07:48.666
That means there were two other people
who went to the west warehouse.

599
01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:56.875
Maybe it was them
who made the bigger violation.

600
01:07:59.625 --> 01:08:00.875
Jinah.

601
01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:07.291
Are you sure this has something to do
with the forbidden warehouse?

602
01:08:09.625 --> 01:08:10.916
Forbidden warehouse?

603
01:08:16.875 --> 01:08:21.583
This west warehouse
is where the big fire happened.

604
01:08:23.125 --> 01:08:28.083
It is forbidden
for anyone to enter the warehouse.

605
01:10:26.458 --> 01:10:32.208
Humans and jinn
live together on this land.

606
01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:37.208
We have promised to live harmoniously.

607
01:10:38.791 --> 01:10:42.166
Whoever breaks the promise will die.

608
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:44.666
Die!

609
01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:47.500
Die!

610
01:10:48.375 --> 01:10:49.458
Die!

611
01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:51.291
Die!

612
01:10:52.083 --> 01:10:54.458
Die!

613
01:13:35.333 --> 01:13:36.458
Ma'am.

614
01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:37.958
What is this place?

615
01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:44.750
In the past, during the colonial era,
accidents often happened here.

616
01:13:47.083 --> 01:13:50.666
They finally made a pact with Maharatu,

617
01:13:51.416 --> 01:13:53.083
Queen of the Spirit Kingdom,

618
01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:56.291
to not bother each other.

619
01:13:58.041 --> 01:13:59.250
Since then,

620
01:14:00.083 --> 01:14:02.541
this warehouse has become a sacred place.

621
01:14:03.625 --> 01:14:04.916
Seven years ago,

622
01:14:05.625 --> 01:14:07.625
a group of seasonal workers

623
01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.791
did something reckless here.

624
01:14:11.916 --> 01:14:17.583
That mistake angered the spirits

625
01:14:18.875 --> 01:14:21.041
and a big fire broke out.

626
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:23.333
After that,

627
01:14:24.625 --> 01:14:26.916
this warehouse was closed completely.

628
01:14:27.708 --> 01:14:32.291
I didn't expect someone would trespass…

629
01:14:36.875 --> 01:14:40.250
and break this supernatural barrier.

630
01:14:41.583 --> 01:14:43.041
Not only that,

631
01:14:43.791 --> 01:14:47.583
someone has stolen Maharatu's belongings.

632
01:14:49.041 --> 01:14:50.500
What belongings?

633
01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.000
I don't see anything.

634
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.666
Only people with special abilities
can see it.

635
01:14:58.375 --> 01:14:59.541
What do you see?

636
01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:03.416
The thing is, I also don't see anything.

637
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.500
I knew it.

638
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.041
There was gold jewelry,
invisible to the common eye,

639
01:15:17.125 --> 01:15:19.041
belonging to Maharatu.

640
01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:25.208
But somehow,
someone was able to see it and took it.

641
01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:28.708
We're in serious danger now.

642
01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:31.750
-We--
-Jinah.

643
01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.750
-Mrs. Marni.
-Ma'am?

644
01:15:50.125 --> 01:15:51.750
Mrs. Marni.

645
01:16:02.333 --> 01:16:03.958
Mrs. Marni.

646
01:16:04.041 --> 01:16:05.125
Ma'am.

647
01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:19.208
Rano, Karno,

648
01:16:20.333 --> 01:16:22.500
take her home.

649
01:16:22.583 --> 01:16:23.791
Yes, ma'am.

650
01:16:32.541 --> 01:16:34.750
The missing gold

651
01:16:35.916 --> 01:16:39.166
was probably taken
by the two people in your dream.

652
01:16:41.916 --> 01:16:43.125
Please help me

653
01:16:44.041 --> 01:16:45.541
find out who they are.

654
01:16:47.375 --> 01:16:48.458
Yes, ma'am.

655
01:16:49.583 --> 01:16:50.625
Let's go.

656
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.833
The door! Where is it?

657
01:17:39.541 --> 01:17:41.250
Endah?

658
01:17:41.333 --> 01:17:42.916
Endah!

659
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.166
Endah!

660
01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:47.708
Wati!

661
01:17:47.791 --> 01:17:49.041
Wati!

662
01:17:56.833 --> 01:17:58.541
No!

663
01:18:04.375 --> 01:18:06.000
Forgive me!

664
01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:35.208
Hey, Naning!

665
01:18:35.291 --> 01:18:38.250
Naning! It's me, Hendra.

666
01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:39.375
Hey!

667
01:18:41.875 --> 01:18:43.166
What happened?

668
01:18:45.166 --> 01:18:47.250
Hey! Naning!

669
01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:50.333
It's all because of this!

670
01:18:58.083 --> 01:19:00.041
God damn you!

671
01:19:00.125 --> 01:19:02.125
Why is this here? Huh?

672
01:19:03.458 --> 01:19:05.000
I told you not to take it!

673
01:19:05.083 --> 01:19:07.416
I couldn't resist!

674
01:19:13.125 --> 01:19:14.416
Damn it.

675
01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.791
We must return it.

676
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:19.958
If the others find out,
we will be screwed!

677
01:19:20.041 --> 01:19:21.125
Let's go!

678
01:19:37.333 --> 01:19:39.083
Stop it. Come on!

679
01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:00.416
What? You're scared?

680
01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:02.916
This is all your fault.

681
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.833
And now you're scared?

682
01:20:08.958 --> 01:20:10.750
Naning!

683
01:20:10.833 --> 01:20:12.083
Naning!

684
01:20:15.041 --> 01:20:16.458
Naning, snap out of it.

685
01:20:16.541 --> 01:20:18.708
Let's go. Come on!

686
01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:26.666
Let's go.

687
01:20:28.166 --> 01:20:30.958
What were Endah and Fadhil doing
in Mrs. Marni's house?

688
01:20:31.041 --> 01:20:32.375
I don't know.

689
01:20:34.833 --> 01:20:38.041
Maybe it has something to do with Eko,
the missing guy.

690
01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:41.291
-Your workmate at the crane station?
-Yep.

691
01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:45.541
His roommate said he was in his room
long before the red hours.

692
01:20:47.958 --> 01:20:50.666
Why is Hendra not back yet?
He was getting Naning.

693
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:52.541
The food is getting cold.

694
01:21:08.541 --> 01:21:11.250
-Franky, Dwi!
-That's Fadhil and Endah.

695
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.125
Fadhil.

696
01:21:20.666 --> 01:21:21.750
Endah?

697
01:21:25.833 --> 01:21:27.000
Endah! Fadhil!

698
01:21:28.875 --> 01:21:31.458
What's going on? Where's Hendra?

699
01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:32.875
-Naning?
-Hendra?

700
01:21:32.958 --> 01:21:38.583
-Hendra!
-Naning!

701
01:21:43.166 --> 01:21:44.291
Naning!

702
01:21:47.583 --> 01:21:50.666
Are you sure Hendra and Naning
aren't at the lodge?

703
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:51.833
They aren't there.

704
01:21:51.916 --> 01:21:53.291
We were just there.

705
01:21:54.875 --> 01:21:59.541
The two people in your dream,
were they a man and a woman?

706
01:22:02.458 --> 01:22:05.583
Maybe Hendra and Naning did it.

707
01:22:05.666 --> 01:22:07.000
Hang on.

708
01:22:07.083 --> 01:22:08.750
Did what?

709
01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:11.583
What is happening?

710
01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:22.333
Whose gold is this?

711
01:22:23.625 --> 01:22:26.083
And why did you get called
to Mrs. Marni's house?

712
01:22:26.166 --> 01:22:27.333
It's a long story.

713
01:22:28.458 --> 01:22:29.958
One thing's for sure,

714
01:22:30.041 --> 01:22:33.750
all the strange happenings here
are because someone stole this.

715
01:22:34.333 --> 01:22:36.375
This is sacred, it belongs to the spirits.

716
01:22:36.916 --> 01:22:38.041
Spirits?

717
01:22:38.791 --> 01:22:40.875
-You mean ghosts?
-Hang on.

718
01:22:40.958 --> 01:22:42.750
What are you talking about?

719
01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:43.875
Stole what?

720
01:22:46.083 --> 01:22:48.583
Are you accusing
Hendra and Naning of stealing?

721
01:22:51.791 --> 01:22:53.333
Based on your dream?

722
01:22:54.666 --> 01:22:56.750
Hendra would never steal anything.

723
01:22:57.916 --> 01:22:59.208
Let's go find them.

724
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.208
We still have time before the red hours.

725
01:23:03.083 --> 01:23:04.583
Dwi, Franky.

726
01:23:05.333 --> 01:23:08.583
Find Rano and Karno. Ask them to help us.

727
01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:10.416
Okay?

728
01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.500
Endah.

729
01:23:11.583 --> 01:23:13.791
Please go back to the west warehouse.

730
01:23:13.875 --> 01:23:17.666
Bring that gold and tell Jinah
that our two friends are missing.

731
01:23:19.208 --> 01:23:21.041
And where are you going to go?

732
01:23:21.125 --> 01:23:22.625
I'll search the lodges.

733
01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:27.125
Maybe someone saw Hendra and Naning.

734
01:23:29.041 --> 01:23:30.666
Fadhil, I'm going with you.

735
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:31.791
Wait. Dwi?

736
01:23:31.875 --> 01:23:34.375
-Fadhil! Can I? Please?
-What's wrong?

737
01:23:34.458 --> 01:23:35.708
Let's go.

738
01:23:35.791 --> 01:23:37.250
I should go with Fadhil.

739
01:23:37.333 --> 01:23:40.666
Forget him. You're safer with me.
I know this area best.

740
01:23:55.416 --> 01:23:57.000
Help. My friend is inside.

741
01:23:57.083 --> 01:23:58.083
Your friend?

742
01:23:58.166 --> 01:23:59.541
-Help.
-What's going on?

743
01:24:03.208 --> 01:24:05.375
Help. In here.

744
01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:08.833
In there. In that room.

745
01:24:10.291 --> 01:24:11.875
Help.

746
01:24:11.958 --> 01:24:13.166
Just go in.

747
01:24:16.875 --> 01:24:18.416
Peace be upon you.

748
01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:33.583
Sir?

749
01:24:34.541 --> 01:24:36.250
The one outside?

750
01:24:36.333 --> 01:24:38.125
The one outside isn't human.

751
01:25:25.083 --> 01:25:29.458
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Satan.

752
01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:33.916
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Satan.

753
01:26:01.916 --> 01:26:03.125
Oh, my God.

754
01:26:03.208 --> 01:26:04.625
Sir?

755
01:26:08.791 --> 01:26:10.208
Naning?

756
01:26:10.291 --> 01:26:11.541
Hendra?

757
01:26:13.125 --> 01:26:14.166
Naning?

758
01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:15.416
Hendra?

759
01:26:17.625 --> 01:26:19.041
Naning!

760
01:26:19.125 --> 01:26:20.458
Hendra!

761
01:26:21.458 --> 01:26:24.833
Why are you mimicking me?
Your tone is exactly the same as mine.

762
01:26:24.916 --> 01:26:27.166
Well, all you do is call for Naning.

763
01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:28.625
So what?

764
01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:30.833
Judging from past experience,

765
01:26:30.916 --> 01:26:33.833
the more you call her,
the more she will run away.

766
01:26:33.916 --> 01:26:35.500
Not always!

767
01:26:35.583 --> 01:26:37.041
But, okay.

768
01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:39.375
-Hendra!
-Naning!

769
01:26:39.458 --> 01:26:41.500
-Hendra!
-Naning!

770
01:26:43.375 --> 01:26:44.375
Hendra!

771
01:26:44.458 --> 01:26:45.625
Naning!

772
01:27:17.125 --> 01:27:18.500
Damn it!

773
01:27:18.583 --> 01:27:20.041
He's got a hole in his face!

774
01:27:22.375 --> 01:27:24.625
Mulyono, wait for me!

775
01:27:28.875 --> 01:27:31.166
There's no way. Hendra is not a thief.

776
01:27:32.875 --> 01:27:33.958
Endah!

777
01:27:36.375 --> 01:27:37.833
This place is not right.

778
01:27:46.208 --> 01:27:48.208
Let's go. Don't look back.

779
01:28:03.583 --> 01:28:05.416
Wait here, okay?

780
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.625
Franky, wait for me!

781
01:29:02.541 --> 01:29:03.708
Franky!

782
01:29:06.791 --> 01:29:08.041
What now?

783
01:29:11.875 --> 01:29:13.708
I'll count to 17.

784
01:29:14.833 --> 01:29:16.875
And then we run, okay?

785
01:29:16.958 --> 01:29:20.333
Not 17. I'll wet myself before then.

786
01:29:20.416 --> 01:29:22.583
One, two…

787
01:29:22.666 --> 01:29:23.916
Seventeen!

788
01:29:37.708 --> 01:29:38.708
Franky.

789
01:29:39.375 --> 01:29:41.291
remember what Karno said?

790
01:29:42.916 --> 01:29:47.958
He said if we didn't politely
excuse ourselves, she wouldn't go away.

791
01:29:48.041 --> 01:29:49.458
Hurry up and do it then!

792
01:29:49.541 --> 01:29:50.666
Why me?

793
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:52.041
You're in front.

794
01:29:52.125 --> 01:29:53.375
Wait.

795
01:29:53.458 --> 01:29:55.791
Franky!

796
01:29:55.875 --> 01:29:57.083
Just do it, Dwi!

797
01:29:58.583 --> 01:29:59.750
Miss…

798
01:30:00.791 --> 01:30:02.208
excuse me.

799
01:30:02.291 --> 01:30:03.416
My apologies.

800
01:30:05.208 --> 01:30:06.541
Good evening.

801
01:30:08.083 --> 01:30:10.375
She's not responding. Franky!

802
01:30:10.458 --> 01:30:13.000
Not every ghost originates from Java.

803
01:30:13.083 --> 01:30:14.208
Try again!

804
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:16.750
Miss…

805
01:30:17.416 --> 01:30:18.958
peace be upon you.

806
01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:23.875
Franky, you do it.

807
01:30:25.041 --> 01:30:26.541
Dwi!

808
01:30:26.625 --> 01:30:27.625
Miss…

809
01:30:28.166 --> 01:30:29.708
excuse me.

810
01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.625
It's not that we're arrogant,

811
01:30:32.208 --> 01:30:34.041
or don't want to chat with you,

812
01:30:34.666 --> 01:30:37.750
-but we're very busy.
-That's right.

813
01:30:39.041 --> 01:30:40.208
Excuse…

814
01:30:47.833 --> 01:30:48.875
Dwi,

815
01:30:48.958 --> 01:30:51.125
did she just wet herself?

816
01:30:51.208 --> 01:30:53.708
I think the ghost is scared of you.

817
01:31:05.916 --> 01:31:06.958
Hey!

818
01:31:07.041 --> 01:31:08.625
Dwi! Franky!

819
01:31:08.708 --> 01:31:09.791
Damn you!

820
01:31:09.875 --> 01:31:10.916
You startled us!

821
01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:13.958
Have you found Naning and Hendra?

822
01:31:14.041 --> 01:31:17.083
Not yet,
but we found a ghost who wet herself.

823
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:21.375
When the ghost saw Franky, she--

824
01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:25.750
Where else are you going?

825
01:31:26.583 --> 01:31:28.500
I'm going to the west warehouse.

826
01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:30.500
I'm scared for Endah and Wati.

827
01:31:30.583 --> 01:31:31.708
Okay, then.

828
01:31:31.791 --> 01:31:33.416
Let's not split up again.

829
01:31:34.666 --> 01:31:36.083
-Come.
-Fadhil, in front.

830
01:31:36.166 --> 01:31:37.166
Let's go.

831
01:31:50.541 --> 01:31:51.583
Sir.

832
01:31:53.166 --> 01:31:54.708
Where are you going?

833
01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:56.750
It's red hour.

834
01:31:58.041 --> 01:31:59.250
We want to…

835
01:32:02.875 --> 01:32:04.333
return something.

836
01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:09.500
All right, go ahead.

837
01:32:11.333 --> 01:32:12.583
Thank you.

838
01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:15.708
Excuse me.

839
01:32:25.166 --> 01:32:26.291
Rano?

840
01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:27.708
Are they the thieves?

841
01:32:29.250 --> 01:32:31.208
Jinah has got some serious magic.

842
01:32:32.125 --> 01:32:36.916
We haven't even looked for the thieves,
but they're already turning themselves in.

843
01:32:38.416 --> 01:32:40.291
Imagine if Ms. Jinah was a cop.

844
01:32:40.375 --> 01:32:42.041
Jails would be full.

845
01:32:42.125 --> 01:32:44.541
She would make a super policewoman.

846
01:32:46.416 --> 01:32:48.041
But she'd be too old, I think.

847
01:32:53.708 --> 01:32:55.375
This is not everything.

848
01:32:59.583 --> 01:33:00.708
Ma'am…

849
01:33:01.958 --> 01:33:03.875
I found this at the lodge.

850
01:33:18.291 --> 01:33:19.750
Did you steal this?

851
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.041
Huh?

852
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:25.375
Why did you have to steal?

853
01:33:26.333 --> 01:33:28.208
Because of my mother's demands?

854
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.916
Just forget about the wedding reception!

855
01:33:33.083 --> 01:33:34.416
Oh, God!

856
01:33:36.666 --> 01:33:39.166
What did you do here

857
01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:42.916
that gave you the ability
to see Maharatu's belongings?

858
01:33:49.875 --> 01:33:51.875
It's better for you to come clean.

859
01:33:52.708 --> 01:33:54.750
This can bring harm to everyone.

860
01:33:55.791 --> 01:33:57.166
Including both of you.

861
01:34:00.666 --> 01:34:02.375
What did you do?

862
01:34:06.583 --> 01:34:08.375
On the first night,

863
01:34:09.625 --> 01:34:12.208
we came to this factory…

864
01:34:16.708 --> 01:34:18.083
We…

865
01:36:38.666 --> 01:36:40.500
I hate this.

866
01:36:40.583 --> 01:36:42.708
Why did Wati have to come here?

867
01:36:42.791 --> 01:36:46.500
It makes it hard for us.
Have to meet discreetly, late at night.

868
01:36:48.541 --> 01:36:50.541
But this is more exciting, right?

869
01:36:51.875 --> 01:36:53.041
Don't mind her.

870
01:36:54.333 --> 01:36:56.500
Stop making a long face.

871
01:36:58.125 --> 01:36:59.541
You have a pretty face.

872
01:37:00.625 --> 01:37:01.625
Come here.

873
01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:13.791
Naning?

874
01:37:27.250 --> 01:37:28.375
Naning?

875
01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:31.291
Hey.

876
01:37:32.041 --> 01:37:33.166
Hey, Naning!

877
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Naning!

878
01:38:15.416 --> 01:38:16.416
Naning!

879
01:38:18.833 --> 01:38:20.541
Hendra, look.

880
01:38:24.833 --> 01:38:27.291
Hey! Don't take it!

881
01:38:31.291 --> 01:38:33.416
I have a bad feeling about this.

882
01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.916
This place is strange.

883
01:38:36.416 --> 01:38:38.125
Come on, let's just go back.

884
01:38:41.708 --> 01:38:45.833
You know! You know she's my best friend!

885
01:38:45.916 --> 01:38:49.166
Naning! You know I'm going to marry him!

886
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:52.166
Oh, God!

887
01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:53.625
How could you?

888
01:38:53.708 --> 01:38:55.583
You piece of shit!

889
01:38:58.125 --> 01:39:01.750
You know how much I like Naning.

890
01:39:02.416 --> 01:39:04.250
And you had to have her, too?

891
01:39:04.333 --> 01:39:06.541
You're engaged to be married!

892
01:39:14.083 --> 01:39:17.541
You committed a sin in this place.

893
01:39:19.833 --> 01:39:24.166
That gave you the ability
to see Maharatu's gold.

894
01:39:26.166 --> 01:39:30.958
That's because adultery
is Satan's favorite sin.

895
01:39:31.875 --> 01:39:35.375
And it will open the gate to other sins.

896
01:39:36.416 --> 01:39:40.166
I thought all of this happened
because of me.

897
01:39:42.625 --> 01:39:44.458
It was you all along!

898
01:39:48.083 --> 01:39:49.625
Forgive me.

899
01:39:52.958 --> 01:39:55.083
I'm sorry.

900
01:39:58.833 --> 01:40:00.333
Wati.

901
01:40:00.416 --> 01:40:02.625
It's my fault.

902
01:40:04.875 --> 01:40:08.083
Don't!

903
01:40:08.875 --> 01:40:09.958
Wati!

904
01:41:42.166 --> 01:41:44.083
-Wati!
-Wati!

905
01:41:44.166 --> 01:41:46.041
-Wati!
-Wati!

906
01:41:51.208 --> 01:41:53.166
Rano, what's happening to her?

907
01:43:00.958 --> 01:43:02.666
Help me hold them off!

908
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:03.875
Hurry!

909
01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:35.666
Wati…

910
01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:26.208
Endah?

911
01:44:53.541 --> 01:44:56.416
A long time ago,

912
01:44:56.500 --> 01:45:00.250
this was a sacred place.

913
01:45:01.833 --> 01:45:04.916
A quiet and dense forest.

914
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.791
Animals came and died.

915
01:45:07.875 --> 01:45:11.125
Men came, and only their names
would leave the place.

916
01:45:11.208 --> 01:45:12.458
However,

917
01:45:12.541 --> 01:45:17.083
after greedy humans came,

918
01:45:18.083 --> 01:45:24.166
the beautiful shady trees

919
01:45:24.250 --> 01:45:29.708
And that became a huge problem.

920
01:45:29.791 --> 01:45:31.750
Therefore,

921
01:45:31.833 --> 01:45:36.875
don't blame the ancestors for asking
for a human blood sacrifice!

922
01:46:23.083 --> 01:46:24.333
The offerings.

923
01:46:30.083 --> 01:46:31.291
The bride and groom.

924
01:47:04.708 --> 01:47:05.708
Are you okay?

925
01:47:10.666 --> 01:47:11.666
Endah?

926
01:47:13.625 --> 01:47:15.375
Endah! Oh, God!

927
01:47:15.458 --> 01:47:16.500
Endah.

928
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.916
We have to prepare them, Jinah.

929
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.916
We have no other choice.

930
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.833
They took advantage of this incident
to demand another human sacrifice.

931
01:47:31.625 --> 01:47:32.750
You're right.

932
01:47:33.333 --> 01:47:36.208
We should comply
with the spirits' demands.

933
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:40.625
Or everyone's lives will be in danger.

934
01:47:42.333 --> 01:47:44.333
They have to be sacrificed.

935
01:47:45.791 --> 01:47:48.875
They're the bride and groom
the spirits have chosen.

936
01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.291
-What?
-Ma'am.

937
01:47:53.166 --> 01:47:55.625
Forgive me, ma'am.

938
01:47:56.458 --> 01:47:58.750
We know we made a mistake.

939
01:47:58.833 --> 01:48:01.791
We will do anything.

940
01:48:01.875 --> 01:48:05.541
But don't make us the sacrifice.

941
01:48:05.625 --> 01:48:08.250
I don't want to die, ma'am.

942
01:48:08.916 --> 01:48:10.333
Help us.

943
01:48:13.291 --> 01:48:15.750
Forgive me.

944
01:48:15.833 --> 01:48:17.875
-Rano.
-Yes, ma'am.

945
01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:20.000
Take them to Mrs. Marni's house.

946
01:48:20.875 --> 01:48:25.583
Tell Mrs. Marni they have to be prepared
as the sugarcane ritual bride and groom.

947
01:48:26.541 --> 01:48:27.541
Yes, ma'am.

948
01:48:27.625 --> 01:48:28.666
Karno.

949
01:48:30.333 --> 01:48:32.375
Help me prepare the ritual.

950
01:48:33.125 --> 01:48:34.541
-Okay.
-Let's go.

951
01:48:35.583 --> 01:48:37.250
Wait!

952
01:48:37.333 --> 01:48:39.375
Is there no other way, ma'am?

953
01:48:39.458 --> 01:48:41.250
Wati!

954
01:48:41.333 --> 01:48:43.916
You saw it yourself, didn't you?

955
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.875
The sugarcane wedding ritual.

956
01:48:46.958 --> 01:48:49.958
Your two friends
have to become the bride and groom.

957
01:48:50.041 --> 01:48:52.750
Why do we have to comply
with the spirits' demand?

958
01:48:52.833 --> 01:48:55.208
Since this sugar factory was built,

959
01:48:55.291 --> 01:48:57.333
before every milling started,

960
01:48:57.416 --> 01:49:00.583
the sugarcane wedding ritual
has been conducted.

961
01:49:04.875 --> 01:49:06.250
Wati!

962
01:49:06.333 --> 01:49:12.000
Ma'am, forgive me!

963
01:49:12.083 --> 01:49:14.000
Wati!

964
01:49:20.791 --> 01:49:26.333
A couple is paraded
to be buried in the sugarcane field

965
01:49:26.416 --> 01:49:29.875
as offerings
to the original inhabitants of this land.

966
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.666
The ruler of the Spirit Kingdom.

967
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:35.083
Let's pray.

968
01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.291
And hope this is for the best.

969
01:49:44.291 --> 01:49:46.625
We tried everything

970
01:49:46.708 --> 01:49:49.708
so we wouldn't
have to sacrifice humans anymore.

971
01:49:51.041 --> 01:49:52.333
Until finally,

972
01:49:52.416 --> 01:49:55.458
they accepted a pair of oxen
and other offerings

973
01:49:55.541 --> 01:49:57.041
as a replacement.

974
01:49:57.833 --> 01:49:59.208
Unfortunately,

975
01:49:59.291 --> 01:50:01.833
the mistakes that your friends made

976
01:50:01.916 --> 01:50:05.708
has resulted in the demand
for the sugarcane wedding ritual again

977
01:50:05.791 --> 01:50:08.083
with human sacrifice.

978
01:51:40.458 --> 01:51:43.916
This is our offering to you.

979
01:53:43.416 --> 01:53:44.416
The offerings.

980
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:54.041
These are the two humans
that have committed the biggest sin.

981
01:53:59.458 --> 01:54:01.750
Forgive us, Maharatu.

982
01:54:07.083 --> 01:54:09.250
Accept our offerings.

983
01:54:12.041 --> 01:54:13.333
The bride and groom.

984
01:54:33.458 --> 01:54:34.833
Mr. Samin.

985
01:54:38.541 --> 01:54:39.750
Mr. Samin.

986
01:55:46.583 --> 01:55:52.083
HENDRA
SON OF SUNARYO

987
01:56:42.583 --> 01:56:47.250
They must stay inside the salt circle
during the ritual.

988
01:57:01.166 --> 01:57:02.625
I cannot believe

989
01:57:03.791 --> 01:57:05.958
they sacrificed humans back then.

990
01:57:21.625 --> 01:57:24.291
Endah, Dwi, let's go.

991
01:57:26.958 --> 01:57:28.291
Let's go.

992
01:57:38.875 --> 01:57:40.041
Wati…

993
01:57:43.208 --> 01:57:46.458
If you don't want me anymore,
I understand.

994
01:57:48.583 --> 01:57:49.875
I just hope

995
01:57:51.208 --> 01:57:54.000
that one day you can forgive me.

996
01:57:59.041 --> 01:58:01.750
I pray you will always be happy, Wati,

997
01:58:03.083 --> 01:58:05.333
with whoever you marry in the future.

998
01:58:07.625 --> 01:58:09.916
I only ask for your forgiveness, Wati.

999
01:58:11.833 --> 01:58:13.916
I hate myself for letting you down.

1000
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.541
Wati!

1001
01:58:15.625 --> 01:58:17.541
-Wati!
-Forgive us, Wati!

1002
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:21.250
Wati!

1003
01:58:24.458 --> 01:58:26.583
Wati.

1004
01:58:42.916 --> 01:58:46.458
Have they completed the ritual?

1005
01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:55.041
This is our first time.

1006
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:22.625
Wati…

1007
01:59:39.041 --> 01:59:40.083
Wati?

1008
01:59:44.083 --> 01:59:45.125
What's going on?

1009
01:59:45.208 --> 01:59:46.208
Hendra!

1010
01:59:46.291 --> 01:59:47.416
-Open up!
-What is this?

1011
01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:48.375
-Hendra!
-Open!

1012
01:59:52.875 --> 01:59:54.666
Hendra!

1013
01:59:54.750 --> 01:59:56.375
Why is the door closed?

1014
01:59:56.458 --> 01:59:58.458
Help! Just break down the door!

1015
02:00:00.875 --> 02:00:02.375
-Naning!
-Hendra!

1016
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.375
Open! Break down the door!

1017
02:00:08.458 --> 02:00:13.000
Come on, push the door harder!

1018
02:00:15.583 --> 02:00:16.583
Wati!

1019
02:00:16.666 --> 02:00:17.666
What's going on?

1020
02:00:18.291 --> 02:00:19.750
What's going on?

1021
02:00:19.833 --> 02:00:23.916
-Hendra!
-Naning!

1022
02:00:25.541 --> 02:00:28.333
Move!

1023
02:00:28.416 --> 02:00:29.500
Come on, Rano!

1024
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:56.333
The field.

1025
02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.166
Let's go!

1026
02:00:58.250 --> 02:01:00.958
-What's going on?
-Let's go, Wati!

1027
02:01:01.041 --> 02:01:03.875
Stop the ritual!

1028
02:01:03.958 --> 02:01:05.625
Stop, Ms. Jinah!

1029
02:01:07.166 --> 02:01:10.791
Move! Ms. Jinah!

1030
02:01:14.166 --> 02:01:15.625
Move!

1031
02:01:15.708 --> 02:01:17.250
What's going on here?

1032
02:01:17.333 --> 02:01:19.000
What's going on?

1033
02:01:20.125 --> 02:01:25.458
-Naning!
-Hendra!

1034
02:01:28.125 --> 02:01:30.708
Naning!

1035
02:02:06.916 --> 02:02:10.291
Human's dirty trickery

1036
02:02:10.375 --> 02:02:14.416
cannot deceive Maharatu!

1037
02:02:29.916 --> 02:02:31.333
Naning!

1038
02:02:31.416 --> 02:02:33.125
Naning!

1039
02:02:37.375 --> 02:02:40.291
-Naning!
-Hendra!

1040
02:02:50.166 --> 02:02:53.000
Get them out!

1041
02:02:53.083 --> 02:02:54.583
Naning!

1042
02:03:45.041 --> 02:03:48.083
We came here full of hope,

1043
02:03:49.583 --> 02:03:51.666
only to return full of grief.

1044
02:03:53.166 --> 02:03:56.125
Our two best friends lost their lives.

1045
02:03:57.541 --> 02:04:01.375
In the end, there was nothing I could do,

1046
02:04:01.458 --> 02:04:05.750
but to take this as a lesson.

1047
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:10.375
Those who sow will reap.

1048
02:04:11.166 --> 02:04:14.750
Those who do wrong
will have to pay the price.

1049
02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.291
We are sorry

1050
02:04:18.333 --> 02:04:20.875
that we were unable to save your friends.

1051
02:04:22.625 --> 02:04:25.958
Just like good deeds
will bring you good rewards,

1052
02:04:26.958 --> 02:04:31.375
bad deeds result in punishment.

1053
02:04:32.458 --> 02:04:35.333
Let's hope they're at peace
on the other side.

1054
02:12:27.916 --> 02:12:29.916
