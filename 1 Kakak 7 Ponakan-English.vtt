1
00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:07.583
-Moko.
-Yes?

2
00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:11.583
-Are you almost done?
-Almost. I just washed my hair.

3
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.208
I mean, I'm about to.

4
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.166
You can't even remember?

5
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.708
-Now what?
-I'm washing my hair.

6
00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:19.791
Please hurry.

7
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.458
-All right, just a second.
-Moko, please hurry.

8
00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:28.000
-Get in line.
-The line starts here.

9
00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:31.375
-Yes, after Woko.
-I really need to poop. Woko!

10
00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.666
Get in line!

11
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.666
Okay. One second. Almost done.

12
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:41.333
See, I'm out.

13
00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:42.458
I was first.

14
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:44.458
I intended to knock before you.

15
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:46.833
"Intended"? Ask the door who was first.

16
00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:48.958
I intended it first, God knows!

17
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:52.333
-Ano!
-I really had to go.

18
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.708
-What?
-Rude!

19
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:58.500
But it's worse to poop in my pants.

20
00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:00.333
Oh, gosh.

21
00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:04.125
And I have an exam today.

22
00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:07.458
If you let me shower first,
I'll finish faster.

23
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:11.041
Faster? You usually take
two hours to shower.

24
00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:12.291
Two hours?

25
00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:16.916
I'm serious. I've repainted this wall
while waiting for you.

26
00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:20.000
You didn't even do it right.

27
00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:21.583
-Stop.
-I was joking.

28
00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:23.791
It's just that you take forever to shower.

29
00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:25.208
Not two hours, though.

30
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.666
I've always given in.
I always let you go first.

31
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.583
But today, I have an exam, Moko.

32
00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:33.500
-I haven't studied yet.
-Who told you not to study?

33
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:36.208
No one. I just haven't.

34
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.875
All right. Do your shower
in stages then. Come on.

35
00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.125
That's better than being late. Come on.

36
00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:43.250
-You've got soap all over.
-Where?

37
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:45.750
You want to be quick, right? Do it here.

38
00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:47.041
No. I'll do it inside.

39
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.541
-In stages.
-Not good enough.

40
00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:53.416
What are you up to?

41
00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:56.083
Where's my watch?

42
00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:01.208
Here, Atmo. Take your medicine.

43
00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:05.666
Agnes, help me with the tie.

44
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.166
Someone is about to graduate from college.

45
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.500
Stay calm, okay? Focus.

46
00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:18.291
You can do it. I'm proud of you, Moko.

47
00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:23.000
-What are you trying to do?
-What? This isn't done yet.

48
00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:26.208
The knot you made is too thick.

49
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:29.333
-Twice. Left and right.
-No. Look.

50
00:03:29.416 --> 00:03:32.041
Twice left and right knots
are for old men.

51
00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:35.666
He's a college student.
People might mistake him for a professor.

52
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.583
Moko may look young,
but inside, he's like a professor.

53
00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:40.500
No, not like a professor.

54
00:03:40.583 --> 00:03:42.083
-What?
-He's just old.

55
00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:44.875
-Here it is. Look.
-No way.

56
00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.708
My tie looks better
because it's neat and more formal.

57
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.250
That's how I tie yours too.

58
00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:54.375
That's because I'm an old man.
Now just tuck it in.

59
00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:56.708
-Moko!
-Yes!

60
00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:58.083
He's coming.

61
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:02.208
Slow down. Don't run.

62
00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:05.666
I'm going, Agnes.

63
00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:08.125
Bye, Ima.

64
00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:10.375
-You can do it, Uncle Moko.
-"Big brother."

65
00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.625
Fine. Big brother. He prefers that.

66
00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:13.875
Atmo.

67
00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:15.916
-Mom, Dad. We're going.
-Stay focused.

68
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.750
-Take care, Woko. Ano.
-Wish me luck, okay?

69
00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:20.000
-Bye.
-Uncle, Aunty. We're going.

70
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.583
Bye!

71
00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:26.083
-Bye!
-Bye!

72
00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:30.083
Bye!

73
00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:31.375
Say bye to the baby.

74
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:37.625
-Look how big he is.
-Yeah. Look at him.

75
00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:41.333
Bye!

76
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.000
Where is Ima? Oh, wow!

77
00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:14.875
Moko.

78
00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:17.500
-Hi.
-Hi.

79
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:20.208
-Are you ready?
-Yes. You?

80
00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:24.250
Try them on.

81
00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:27.125
-Try what?
-Just try them on.

82
00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:29.375
Is it the right size?

83
00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:31.041
Maurin?

84
00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:35.791
It's okay. Just once in a while, Moko.
Here, try these.

85
00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:38.250
Come on. Put them on.

86
00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:41.250
-I'm being an inconvenience.
-No, it's fine.

87
00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:43.416
-Rin.
-Come on, put them on.

88
00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:05.541
-Do they fit?
-Yes.

89
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.416
Thanks.

90
00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:28.333
You shouldn't be worried
about the thesis defense.

91
00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:33.416
You're the top student in our class.
Got a scholarship for grad school.

92
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.625
-But when it comes to scholarships--
-You have no reason to be nervous.

93
00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:39.958
If the examiners ask--

94
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:43.166
Moko, if you're nervous,
what about the others?

95
00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:46.083
Stop that.

96
00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:13.208
You're scared?

97
00:07:19.416 --> 00:07:20.333
Pretty much.

98
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.791
Imagine graduate school, right?

99
00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.041
It will be hard.

100
00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:32.125
So they say.

101
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.125
Because it will challenge
what we've learned.

102
00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:39.791
-Really?
-Yeah, but it will be exciting.

103
00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:47.333
After graduate school,
will you start your own firm?

104
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.708
Let's get a job first.

105
00:07:50.791 --> 00:07:53.041
Yeah, that's what I meant.
Get a job first.

106
00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:55.208
For a year or two.

107
00:07:55.833 --> 00:08:00.041
Once we've gained the knowledge,
then we can start our own firm.

108
00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.333
It won't be easy.

109
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:09.375
I agree. It won't.

110
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.875
But to imagine doing it with you…

111
00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:17.500
I'm willing to do it.

112
00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.166
Me too.

113
00:08:33.541 --> 00:08:36.750
-Hello. Agnes?
-Hello? Maurin?

114
00:08:38.791 --> 00:08:41.458
-Is Moko still in the thesis defense?
-Yes.

115
00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:47.208
Please tell Moko
Atmo had a heart attack.

116
00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:50.625
We're taking him to the hospital.

117
00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:26.166
Atmo.

118
00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:37.333
Sis…

119
00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:40.500
Agnes, what's wrong?

120
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:43.583
Agnes?

121
00:10:44.291 --> 00:10:45.750
-I'm okay.
-Agnes.

122
00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:48.958
-I'm fine.
-Agnes?

123
00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:50.333
Nurse!

124
00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:53.916
-Mom, are you okay?
-Nurse…

125
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.083
Ano, go get a nurse. Hurry up! Sis.

126
00:10:56.166 --> 00:10:58.500
It's fine. My water broke.

127
00:10:58.583 --> 00:10:59.875
-Thank you.
-Yes.

128
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.000
DEATH CERTIFICATE
NAME: ATMO WILOTO - 45 YEARS OLD

OCCUPATION: ARCHITECT

130
00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:28.291
-Excuse me. Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

131
00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:33.166
Here's your baby sister.
She needs to breastfeed.

132
00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:36.125
-Can I wake up Ms. Agnes?
-Sure.

133
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.333
Excuse me, Ms. Agnes. Ma'am?

134
00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:43.625
-Sis?
-Ma'am, let's try breastfeeding.

135
00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:50.750
Please hold the baby.
I need to check on her. Sorry.

136
00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:51.875
Mom?

137
00:11:52.666 --> 00:11:53.708
-Sis?
-Mom?

138
00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:56.166
-Ms. Agnes?
-Mom?

139
00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.541
Ms. Agnes? Ma'am?

140
00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:00.583
What's wrong, Nurse?

141
00:12:00.666 --> 00:12:02.708
Internal bleeding, Doctor. Uterine atony.

142
00:12:02.791 --> 00:12:03.625
Ma'am?

143
00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:07.208
To the treatment room.

144
00:12:08.041 --> 00:12:09.958
Doctor, what's wrong with my sister?

145
00:12:10.041 --> 00:12:12.583
Excuse us. We will explain later.

146
00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:14.208
What is happening?

147
00:12:14.916 --> 00:12:16.750
-Doctor, what's wrong?
-Excuse us.

148
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.208
-We'll get going.
-We'll get going.

149
00:13:18.333 --> 00:13:19.750
-Take care.
-Bye, Ima.

150
00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:31.166
Hi, Mo. What are you doing?

151
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:35.000
I just put Ima to bed. How about you, Osa?

152
00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:39.250
Me? The usual. Just tidying up.

153
00:13:39.916 --> 00:13:43.291
How's Ima? She's healthy?

154
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:55.375
What about the other kids?
Nina, Woko, Ano?

155
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.208
Good. They're all fine.

156
00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:02.875
And what about you?

157
00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:07.291
I'm fine, Sis.

158
00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.875
You sound exhausted.

159
00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:12.375
Not really.

160
00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:19.333
Hey, there's an update.

161
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.458
Eka really can't abandon his work here.

162
00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:28.750
So we can't come home.

163
00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:31.666
I'm sorry.

164
00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:37.541
Yes, Osa. It's fine.

165
00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:48.708
Right here. So, the faculties
will be integrated in this studio.

166
00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.458
They said the project requires networking.

167
00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:55.333
Rin.

168
00:14:57.125 --> 00:14:58.166
I'm sorry, okay?

169
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:06.041
Since I cancelled my master's program,
you have to go on your own.

170
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.208
If I were you, Moko,
I would've done the same.

171
00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:24.333
I feel bad for you, Rin.

172
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.125
Don't you feel bad for yourself?

173
00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:30.083
Why worry about me?

174
00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:44.458
Moko. Sorry. Ima won't stop crying.

175
00:15:46.083 --> 00:15:47.458
She's looking for Moko.

176
00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:52.875
It's okay. I'm leaving anyway. It's late.

177
00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:01.166
Moko, I'm sorry.
But Ima has been crying for a while.

178
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.166
We don't know what else to do.

179
00:16:04.708 --> 00:16:06.000
It's okay.

180
00:16:08.291 --> 00:16:09.500
I'll go check on Ima now.

181
00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:13.875
I'm heading off now.

182
00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.125
-Sorry, Maurin.
-Sorry.

183
00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:16.500
It's okay.

184
00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:17.708
Sorry, Maurin.

185
00:16:17.791 --> 00:16:19.833
-Take care, Maurin.
-Okay. Thanks.

186
00:16:26.291 --> 00:16:27.625
Hi!

187
00:16:30.208 --> 00:16:34.416
Hello. Ima. What is this?

188
00:17:41.416 --> 00:17:44.583
Start with 2.5 million.
If it's okay, we can increase it slowly.

189
00:17:44.666 --> 00:17:47.291
The highest is 3.5 million.
Are you okay with that?

190
00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:49.666
I don't mind, sir.

191
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:54.416
But if I may ask, how many projects
do you usually handle in a month?

192
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.541
Three to five at the most.

193
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.250
-Will you excuse me for a minute?
-Sure. Go ahead.

194
00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:07.458
Pooping? All right.

195
00:18:12.833 --> 00:18:15.541
Yes. What is that, sweetie?

196
00:18:16.083 --> 00:18:17.375
What is that, Ima?

197
00:18:18.166 --> 00:18:21.416
I'm preparing dinner and food
to snack on. Enjoy. - You too.

198
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.916
Rima.

199
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.291
-Ima, right?
-Yes, Ima.

200
00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.333
Everyone here is smart. I feel dumb.

201
00:18:29.416 --> 00:18:31.250
I wish you were here
MESSAGE DELETED

202
00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:33.208
She weighs 7.5 kilograms.

203
00:18:33.291 --> 00:18:35.583
-Okay.
-One second, sweetheart.

204
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.625
-How high?
-It's 39.2 Celsius.

205
00:18:41.708 --> 00:18:44.333
All right. Hold her
for a second, will you?

206
00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:49.916
Okay, just a minute.
Let me take off my shirt first.

207
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.458
I know. I'm sorry.

208
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:55.916
I know. Scoot over.

209
00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:01.250
I know.

210
00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:19.666
You can't do this. There are
many people who want to be drafters.

211
00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:22.541
If you hand in your work late like this,
it will be on me.

212
00:19:22.625 --> 00:19:26.333
-I'm sorry. My niece was sick yesterday--
-I get your situation.

213
00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:29.875
But I can't use that excuse
with the client.

214
00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:31.958
You promised to be on time, right?

215
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:36.375
Sir, give me one more chance.
it won't happen again--

216
00:19:36.458 --> 00:19:39.916
Sorry. I have to replace you.
Sorry, Mo.

217
00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:47.458
I understand, sir.

218
00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:50.583
And once again, I apologize.

219
00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:53.500
I should go now.

220
00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:55.291
Okay.

221
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.291
Let's go.

222
00:20:01.375 --> 00:20:02.625
Did you just get fired?

223
00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:09.166
Just our luck.

224
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.500
Ano.

225
00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:12.208
This iced tea costs 40,000.

226
00:20:13.625 --> 00:20:15.250
It's okay, Ano.

227
00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:17.625
Let's just walk?

228
00:20:33.416 --> 00:20:37.583
When we open our own studio,
the vision should be like this too.

229
00:20:38.916 --> 00:20:42.666
So we don't have to be
all futuristic and minimalist.

230
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.000
-We can just--
-Maurin?

231
00:20:46.083 --> 00:20:47.125
Yes?

232
00:20:48.375 --> 00:20:49.416
Yes, Mo?

233
00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:55.250
-What if we break up?
-Mo?

234
00:21:04.458 --> 00:21:05.958
Sorry, what do you mean?

235
00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:12.500
I want us to break up.

236
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.291
Moko, wait a minute…

237
00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:29.958
Maurin, being with me
means taking care of four children

238
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:31.500
and that's just impossible.

239
00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:35.625
-I'm okay with that--
-Owning a firm is impossible.

240
00:21:35.708 --> 00:21:39.250
It's impossible. And you don't understand
my situation here.

241
00:21:39.916 --> 00:21:43.916
Okay. Tell me, then!
You never tell me.

242
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.750
Because I can't tell you!

243
00:21:47.458 --> 00:21:49.750
I have no time.
How can we start a business?

244
00:21:54.083 --> 00:21:56.250
There's so much
you can achieve in your life.

245
00:21:58.166 --> 00:22:01.000
But that won't happen
if you're stuck with me.

246
00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:04.583
You have to be realistic, Rin.

247
00:22:08.083 --> 00:22:10.625
All right. Let's do it, Mo.
Let's be realistic.

248
00:22:11.208 --> 00:22:12.666
Let's think about it together.

249
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.041
-I can't even draft, Rin.
-Mo…

250
00:22:16.958 --> 00:22:19.416
I can't even create a draft.

251
00:22:21.583 --> 00:22:25.541
And I have to find
other jobs outside of architecture.

252
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.125
All right, then.
I will bathe Ima now, so that she…

253
00:22:38.666 --> 00:22:39.583
I'm signing out.

254
00:23:06.916 --> 00:23:07.875
Mo?

255
00:23:11.166 --> 00:23:12.208
Mo?

256
00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:28.416
But you wanted…
Here, let's wipe you first.

257
00:24:30.208 --> 00:24:33.208
Good girl. Here goes.

258
00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:38.750
Tasty, huh?

259
00:24:45.875 --> 00:24:48.750
-Bali.
-Look, it's Bali.

260
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:51.375
We're going to Kuta.

261
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:56.708
-That spoils the whole thing.
-What are you saying?

262
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.916
Excuse me, sir.

263
00:25:23.625 --> 00:25:28.916
I want to stress that Nina
is an exceptionally accomplished student.

264
00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:30.583
Thank you.

265
00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:33.125
Woko is actually quite smart.

266
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.166
However, he tends to goof around a lot.

267
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.500
Looking at the grades,
it's very concerning.

268
00:25:39.583 --> 00:25:44.250
I hope the family can pay attention
to Rivano's studies.

269
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:45.916
He needs to improve.

270
00:26:18.333 --> 00:26:19.875
All right.

271
00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:30.458
Ima!

272
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:45.875
Moko. Move it there.

273
00:26:46.583 --> 00:26:48.458
When was our last vacation?

274
00:26:48.583 --> 00:26:52.500
-How can we do that, Woko?
-We can barely pay our electricity bill.

275
00:26:54.791 --> 00:26:58.708
I'll glue your mouth shut.
I'm serious.

276
00:26:59.833 --> 00:27:03.291
-So you won't be able to eat duck meat.
-Don't do that.

277
00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:09.250
Let's look at our house. After vacation…

278
00:27:09.333 --> 00:27:12.416
-Can we see our house from there?
-Of course we can.

279
00:27:24.875 --> 00:27:25.833
Let us see, Wo.

280
00:27:46.416 --> 00:27:47.916
Which one do you want?

281
00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:52.416
Yellow? This one, okay?
Here. Let me get it for you. Let's try.

282
00:27:57.083 --> 00:27:57.916
Sir?

283
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.416
Please accept it, Moko.

284
00:28:01.791 --> 00:28:05.250
-I beg you.
-Sir, there's no need for this.

285
00:28:05.333 --> 00:28:07.625
Trust me, Moko.

286
00:28:07.708 --> 00:28:11.000
After one month…
After everything is ready,

287
00:28:11.083 --> 00:28:13.916
I will come back and get Gadis.

288
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.458
Okay?

289
00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:18.541
It's not that I don't want to help.

290
00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:21.291
But I'm taking care
of my four nephews and nieces.

291
00:28:21.375 --> 00:28:23.375
Help me, please, Moko.

292
00:28:23.458 --> 00:28:24.750
I'm so sorry, I can't.

293
00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:26.666
I beg you, Moko.

294
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.666
It's not that I don't want to help.

295
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:32.791
Help me, Moko, please.
Moko, I promise.

296
00:28:32.875 --> 00:28:35.666
-I'll come back.
-Sir, this is unnecessary.

297
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.541
-Sir, I understand--
-I promise.

298
00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:41.416
-It's not that--
-I promise I won't be a burden!

299
00:28:52.416 --> 00:28:55.916
Yeah, I can cook.

300
00:28:56.708 --> 00:28:58.125
I can do laundry too.

301
00:29:02.416 --> 00:29:05.541
I promise I will be good

302
00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:07.375
and I won't be a burden…

303
00:29:08.166 --> 00:29:09.125
at all.

304
00:29:15.333 --> 00:29:16.708
She's been outside?

305
00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:19.875
Yes.

306
00:29:22.125 --> 00:29:23.083
Moko?

307
00:29:24.916 --> 00:29:28.166
Can I stay? I'll help out.

308
00:29:28.916 --> 00:29:31.958
Ais, just come in.

309
00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:35.416
Come in. Here, I'll help you.

310
00:29:37.541 --> 00:29:38.375
Come on in.

311
00:29:39.291 --> 00:29:41.125
-Please sit down, Is.
-Okay.

312
00:29:44.708 --> 00:29:48.041
Come on in. Sit down.

313
00:29:50.166 --> 00:29:51.500
Thank you, Moko.

314
00:29:54.708 --> 00:29:55.750
This is Ima.

315
00:29:56.291 --> 00:30:01.291
Oh, yes. Hello, Ima.

316
00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:03.625
-This is Ais.
-Hi.

317
00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:04.791
Are you sure, Moko?

318
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.208
-No.
-What?

319
00:30:11.708 --> 00:30:13.833
So why did you say yes?

320
00:30:15.041 --> 00:30:16.500
I had no choice, Wo.

321
00:30:18.458 --> 00:30:20.666
You could've just politely refused.

322
00:30:23.083 --> 00:30:25.166
Can we afford to have Ais here?

323
00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:28.125
He gave you money?

324
00:30:32.791 --> 00:30:34.375
Our money is running out.

325
00:30:35.583 --> 00:30:38.833
I've also been freelancing
for the past two years.

326
00:30:38.916 --> 00:30:41.833
The money he gave us
can help with school fees.

327
00:30:46.833 --> 00:30:48.791
I need to look for a proper job.

328
00:30:50.083 --> 00:30:54.625
To maintain this house,
and your college fund. I want you to--

329
00:30:54.708 --> 00:30:58.750
College is not a priority.
I can postpone it.

330
00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:02.375
Besides…

331
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.750
if I go to college and you work,
who's going to look after Ima?

332
00:31:09.166 --> 00:31:10.208
Ano?

333
00:31:15.333 --> 00:31:19.291
Next year. Okay, Wo?
I will try to put you in college.

334
00:31:20.708 --> 00:31:24.375
About Ima, I'll figure something out.

335
00:31:26.333 --> 00:31:27.375
Let's be hopeful.

336
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:29.708
Taste this.

337
00:31:36.916 --> 00:31:39.375
Taste it.

338
00:31:50.916 --> 00:31:52.125
Be careful.

339
00:31:57.166 --> 00:31:58.833
So everyone can get some?

340
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.041
Come and eat!

341
00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.625
Looks like they're having fun.

342
00:32:20.833 --> 00:32:22.916
Food is ready. Tempe orek.

343
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.458
Okay.

344
00:32:26.666 --> 00:32:28.666
Ais is good at it, isn't she?

345
00:32:31.291 --> 00:32:33.625
Yay. Play some more.

346
00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:39.000
What song? Any requests?

347
00:32:39.083 --> 00:32:42.625
-Do you know "Jangan Risaukan"?
-"Jangan Risaukan"?

348
00:32:44.291 --> 00:32:45.250
That's the one.

349
00:32:45.333 --> 00:32:48.791
-The intro…
-Try it.

350
00:32:52.208 --> 00:32:55.375
-That's the one!
-That's right.

351
00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:57.416
-Try it.
-Okay.

352
00:33:23.125 --> 00:33:24.208
I remember!

353
00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:37.916
So what do we say to Ais?

354
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.458
I will talk to Ais later.
I have an interview. Wish me luck.

355
00:33:42.541 --> 00:33:43.583
For sure.

356
00:33:44.333 --> 00:33:46.125
Okay, then. Here, Wo.

357
00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:49.166
Hanoby. "Handover of the Baby."

358
00:33:50.041 --> 00:33:54.208
-Here. With Woko.
-With me, okay?

359
00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:57.625
-Be good.
-Bye, Ima!

360
00:33:57.708 --> 00:34:04.083
Bye, Ima!

361
00:34:04.166 --> 00:34:05.166
Bye!

362
00:34:08.041 --> 00:34:09.375
Bye. Wave again.

363
00:34:09.458 --> 00:34:12.041
-Bye! Again.
-Bye.

364
00:34:12.833 --> 00:34:16.666
Still? Till how far
should we wave goodbye?

365
00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.791
-Bye, Ima!
-Bye!

366
00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:22.583
Bye, Woko.

367
00:34:23.583 --> 00:34:24.416
Bye!

368
00:34:29.416 --> 00:34:30.375
Bye!

369
00:34:50.333 --> 00:34:51.375
But I'm curious.

370
00:34:51.458 --> 00:34:55.375
That gap after you graduated?
Why did you wait a few years?

371
00:34:56.916 --> 00:35:00.000
I happen to have a baby niece, sir.

372
00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:01.875
Okay.

373
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.083
During that gap,
I was taking care of my baby niece.

374
00:35:06.041 --> 00:35:07.291
Okay.

375
00:35:08.083 --> 00:35:09.750
Rin, is it done?

376
00:35:10.583 --> 00:35:12.166
-One second, please.
-Okay.

377
00:35:14.166 --> 00:35:15.291
Okay.

378
00:35:38.666 --> 00:35:40.083
-Here you go.
-Okay.

379
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:46.083
Is he being interviewed
for the new drafter position?

380
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:47.625
Yes, he is.

381
00:35:49.083 --> 00:35:50.583
-Thank you.
-Yes.

382
00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:57.916
-Yes, sir, but--
-No!

383
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.333
I understand you have work experience.

384
00:36:00.416 --> 00:36:03.000
But we have a system here. We have rules.

385
00:36:03.083 --> 00:36:08.041
If the client complaints, how can I
back you up if you don't follow the rules?

386
00:36:08.125 --> 00:36:09.208
Sir, sorry.

387
00:36:09.291 --> 00:36:10.916
Maurin, hang on. I'm in a meeting.

388
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.166
Yes? You understand what I mean, right?

389
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:14.625
Sorry, but this is urgent.

390
00:36:14.708 --> 00:36:17.541
Now, walk me through the work.
I want to take a look.

391
00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:20.333
Come on! Open the laptop.

392
00:36:20.416 --> 00:36:22.541
You need another junior architect, right?

393
00:36:22.625 --> 00:36:23.583
Yes.

394
00:36:23.666 --> 00:36:27.041
Bayu's drafter is applying
to be a full time employee.

395
00:36:27.125 --> 00:36:30.416
I know him very well.
And in my opinion…

396
00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.083
it would be a waste
if he's only hired as a drafter.

397
00:36:33.166 --> 00:36:35.416
Can we talk later? I'm in a meeting!

398
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.541
He's the one you're looking for.

399
00:36:40.875 --> 00:36:41.833
I'm sorry.

400
00:36:43.125 --> 00:36:45.416
So, can you focus on work now?

401
00:36:46.083 --> 00:36:47.125
Full time, yes.

402
00:36:52.583 --> 00:36:54.291
Let's see over here.

403
00:36:58.291 --> 00:37:00.083
-Mr. Alif, sorry.
-Yes?

404
00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:04.500
Mr. Sam said that Mr. Moko could be
considered for the junior architect role.

405
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.708
Okay, but I have to reinterview him.

406
00:37:11.625 --> 00:37:12.666
Can you do it, Moko?

407
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.750
Yes, I can.

408
00:37:14.833 --> 00:37:16.000
-Thank you.
-Of course.

409
00:37:17.583 --> 00:37:18.875
-Excuse me, sir.
-Sure.

410
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.375
Sorry, didn't we agree yesterday
not to tell Mr. Sam yet?

411
00:37:30.166 --> 00:37:34.166
Yes, but Bayu said
I can talk directly to Mr. Sam.

412
00:37:35.166 --> 00:37:39.291
But if it continues,
it'll be difficult for you in the future.

413
00:37:39.375 --> 00:37:43.166
Yes, I understand. I'm sorry.

414
00:37:43.958 --> 00:37:47.083
It's okay.
Next time, please tell me first.

415
00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:59.125
You work here?

416
00:38:01.333 --> 00:38:02.291
Yes.

417
00:38:10.583 --> 00:38:13.291
-Care for a tour?
-Sure. Let's go.

418
00:38:20.708 --> 00:38:21.958
Mr. Sam is a lecturer, Mo.

419
00:38:22.041 --> 00:38:25.958
So he really appreciates it
when people here always want to learn.

420
00:38:28.083 --> 00:38:31.958
-Did Mr. Alif give you a task?
-Yes.

421
00:38:32.833 --> 00:38:35.541
But it's unusual
that you can do it at home.

422
00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:39.916
That's actually Mr. Sam's trick.

423
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.083
During the presentation,
he would be able to tell

424
00:38:44.166 --> 00:38:45.916
if it was your work or not.

425
00:38:50.666 --> 00:38:55.541
When I was evaluated
for the junior architect role,

426
00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:57.208
he also used that design.

427
00:38:58.958 --> 00:39:01.500
Because that was
Mr. Sam's first project design.

428
00:39:01.583 --> 00:39:02.541
Oh, yeah?

429
00:39:06.833 --> 00:39:09.458
Mo, are you still using your old laptop?

430
00:39:10.125 --> 00:39:11.375
From college?

431
00:39:12.625 --> 00:39:13.583
I am.

432
00:39:16.541 --> 00:39:19.166
The latest version
of Rhino is really heavy.

433
00:39:20.541 --> 00:39:23.583
You can borrow my laptop if you want.

434
00:39:23.666 --> 00:39:26.791
No. I'm planning to buy a new one
this afternoon anyway.

435
00:39:26.875 --> 00:39:28.458
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

436
00:39:29.041 --> 00:39:30.875
-You have time for that?
-Yes.

437
00:39:30.958 --> 00:39:35.416
It was my plan because I have to…

438
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:40.166
It's fine. It's just that Mr. Sam
will scold me if you can't finish it.

439
00:39:41.791 --> 00:39:44.833
-But that's okay.
-Hang on, "Scold you"?

440
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.291
No, it's fine.

441
00:39:49.666 --> 00:39:51.083
How are the kids?

442
00:40:11.583 --> 00:40:13.166
Ima plays by herself now.

443
00:40:14.416 --> 00:40:15.833
She's two years old now.

444
00:40:19.333 --> 00:40:20.541
The transition period.

445
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.500
Transition period?

446
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:32.083
She used to be fully dependent on me.

447
00:40:32.708 --> 00:40:34.583
But now she knows what she wants.

448
00:40:35.208 --> 00:40:38.125
That's why she often throws
tantrums and gets frustrated.

449
00:40:42.208 --> 00:40:44.000
What about Nina?

450
00:40:46.083 --> 00:40:47.125
Nina?

451
00:40:50.375 --> 00:40:54.416
Where have you been?

452
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.791
-Shut up!
-I'm asking you a question. Na!

453
00:40:57.875 --> 00:40:59.666
We were all worried about you.

454
00:41:00.833 --> 00:41:02.208
Where have you been?

455
00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:10.916
Where, Na? You should have let us know.

456
00:41:13.416 --> 00:41:15.666
Na, I kept calling,
but you didn't answer.

457
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.291
-Na! Where--
-Stop it! You're not my father!

458
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.750
Recently I had a fight with Nina.

459
00:41:21.833 --> 00:41:24.833
She came home late. Then I scolded her.

460
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:40.000
Got dumped? Nina?

461
00:41:43.625 --> 00:41:45.791
And it was recorded. That's insane.

462
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.625
How could he?

463
00:41:47.708 --> 00:41:51.708
Turns out she just got dumped
and it was recorded.

464
00:41:52.625 --> 00:41:54.458
-Really?
-Yeah. Cruel, isn't it?

465
00:42:00.333 --> 00:42:01.791
I'm sorry.

466
00:42:04.916 --> 00:42:07.750
I only found out yesterday
about what happened to you.

467
00:42:11.708 --> 00:42:13.250
I also apologize…

468
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.333
for making you feel like
I'm controlling you.

469
00:42:25.208 --> 00:42:27.416
I should be the one apologizing, Moko.

470
00:42:30.916 --> 00:42:32.125
No.

471
00:42:33.166 --> 00:42:34.708
I should've understood.

472
00:42:46.625 --> 00:42:48.166
They're really mean.

473
00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:51.125
They plotted to trick me.

474
00:42:55.625 --> 00:42:57.375
Actually, I…

475
00:42:58.166 --> 00:43:01.750
To be someone that she can talk to…

476
00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:06.333
it made me happy.
It must've been hard to be in her shoes.

477
00:43:11.458 --> 00:43:14.166
How is Woko doing?

478
00:43:17.041 --> 00:43:18.791
He has sacrificed the most.

479
00:43:38.666 --> 00:43:41.583
He works as a driver
so Nina can go to college.

480
00:43:42.541 --> 00:43:45.416
He really wanted to go to college too.
Law school.

481
00:43:45.958 --> 00:43:49.708
But for his younger siblings,
he's willing to forget his dream.

482
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.750
What about Ano?

483
00:44:03.208 --> 00:44:07.125
Ano said he wants to be an architect.

484
00:44:07.208 --> 00:44:09.166
Because he was inspired by Atmo.

485
00:44:10.458 --> 00:44:12.666
-Seriously?
-Cool, right?

486
00:44:15.875 --> 00:44:17.583
There's one more story, Rin.

487
00:44:19.666 --> 00:44:23.166
My childhood piano teacher
came to my house.

488
00:44:23.875 --> 00:44:25.708
He entrusted his daughter to me.

489
00:44:26.208 --> 00:44:27.750
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

490
00:44:27.833 --> 00:44:29.416
He said he won't be long.

491
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.458
A month or so,
while he prepared everything,

492
00:44:32.541 --> 00:44:34.750
so Ais can join him.

493
00:44:35.458 --> 00:44:37.708
Her name is Gadis, we call her "Ais."

494
00:44:38.875 --> 00:44:40.375
She's a very nice girl, Rin.

495
00:44:42.791 --> 00:44:45.125
-So--
-Here's the flash disk.

496
00:44:47.708 --> 00:44:49.583
And, Maurin, Mr. Sam's asking for you.

497
00:44:50.291 --> 00:44:52.541
Yeah, I'll be there. Thank you.

498
00:44:55.583 --> 00:44:58.333
Okay, then. Keep your spirits up.

499
00:44:59.541 --> 00:45:01.333
Let me know if you need anything.

500
00:45:01.416 --> 00:45:02.458
Okay.

501
00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:04.541
-I should go.
-Okay.

502
00:45:23.833 --> 00:45:27.958
-Excuse me, Miss? Which way is the exit?
-Over there.

503
00:45:29.083 --> 00:45:30.708
Yes, sir, that's right.

504
00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:35.583
I am interested in buying your laptop
because I know you're an architect. Yes.

505
00:45:35.666 --> 00:45:39.833
You want payment on the spot? Okay.
Just send the time and location.

506
00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:42.458
Yes. Thank you, sir.

507
00:45:49.416 --> 00:45:51.625
Moko!

508
00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:54.125
Ano said he's having a stomachache.

509
00:45:54.208 --> 00:45:55.291
What's wrong?

510
00:45:55.375 --> 00:45:58.875
-It feels like needles piercing.
-Needles?

511
00:46:02.875 --> 00:46:05.833
Based on the blood test
and ultrasound results

512
00:46:05.916 --> 00:46:07.916
he can be treated on an outpatient basis.

513
00:46:08.583 --> 00:46:13.250
But we would like to monitor him
until the IV is done, okay?

514
00:46:14.125 --> 00:46:15.875
-Thanks, Doctor.
-You're welcome.

515
00:46:22.333 --> 00:46:23.958
The IV bag is still full?

516
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:31.791
Sir?

517
00:46:32.333 --> 00:46:37.416
Your National Health Insurance payments
have been overdue for two years.

518
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.166
For the moment,
we're unable to process it.

519
00:46:41.333 --> 00:46:44.166
Right. If I may know,

520
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:47.333
how much will it cost
without the insurance?

521
00:46:49.791 --> 00:46:52.916
It's Rp 2,852,000 in total.

522
00:46:54.333 --> 00:46:56.291
Bank transfer or debit card?

523
00:46:57.416 --> 00:46:58.958
Give me a moment.

524
00:46:59.041 --> 00:47:02.333
-Okay. Here, sir.
-Thank you.

525
00:47:05.833 --> 00:47:06.791
Sir.

526
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:10.875
Sir.

527
00:47:12.125 --> 00:47:14.541
I'm sorry, I don't think
I can buy the laptop.

528
00:47:14.625 --> 00:47:18.250
Why? It's not everyday you can find
a MacBook at such a great price.

529
00:47:18.333 --> 00:47:19.833
It has the M1 chip.

530
00:47:19.916 --> 00:47:22.041
Whatever app you want to install,
I can wait.

531
00:47:22.125 --> 00:47:24.208
Just try, it will definitely run smoothly.

532
00:47:24.291 --> 00:47:26.166
The battery is still at more than 90%.

533
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:29.041
You can use it all day, no problem.

534
00:47:29.125 --> 00:47:31.625
And it's really light, only 1.29 kg.

535
00:47:31.708 --> 00:47:33.958
You can get the scale and check.
I'm not lying.

536
00:47:34.041 --> 00:47:36.583
-You can check the status. It's all good.
-Look…

537
00:47:36.666 --> 00:47:41.958
The reason I'm canceling…

538
00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.875
is because…

539
00:47:45.083 --> 00:47:46.000
my nephew is sick.

540
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:49.250
Enteritis. I'm handling the bill now.

541
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:53.666
I hope he gets better soon.

542
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.291
But this hospital is good.

543
00:47:56.375 --> 00:47:58.916
I remember when I was treated here.

544
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.125
This hospital is excellent.
They are meticulous.

545
00:48:03.208 --> 00:48:06.041
The Emergency Room
is very efficiently structured.

546
00:48:06.125 --> 00:48:08.833
The machines' specifications
are also no joke.

547
00:48:08.916 --> 00:48:12.125
I didn't check the Wi-Fi,
but you can do it later.

548
00:48:12.208 --> 00:48:15.833
-The signal was 5G on my cellphone.
-Right.

549
00:48:15.916 --> 00:48:19.666
So this hospital
is a good choice, don't worry.

550
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:21.000
-I was satisfied.
-Yes.

551
00:48:21.083 --> 00:48:24.291
I know this hospital is great.
That's why it's expensive.

552
00:48:24.375 --> 00:48:27.666
Price is relative.
The point is to get well, right?

553
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:31.250
I forget how much it was
because I used insurance.

554
00:48:31.333 --> 00:48:33.291
I forget how much the bill was.

555
00:48:33.375 --> 00:48:37.500
It was worth it. With insurance,
we're only paying Rp 100,000 per month.

556
00:48:37.583 --> 00:48:42.625
I was treated here for about
three or four days, but the bill…

557
00:48:45.416 --> 00:48:47.416
Why did you end up with enteritis?

558
00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:48.541
Woko…

559
00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:50.250
He ate too much fried food.

560
00:48:50.333 --> 00:48:54.250
-All that oil must have built up.
-Enough.

561
00:48:54.333 --> 00:48:56.208
-Here.
-Thank you, Ais.

562
00:48:56.291 --> 00:49:01.250
-Take your medicine after eating.
-Okay.

563
00:49:01.333 --> 00:49:03.458
But don't eat fried food anymore.

564
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:05.458
Okay.

565
00:49:08.166 --> 00:49:09.916
-Can I take a look too?
-Sure.

566
00:49:11.041 --> 00:49:13.375
Can you still use the old laptop?

567
00:49:13.458 --> 00:49:16.250
I can,
but I have to use a different software.

568
00:49:16.333 --> 00:49:17.958
A lighter one.

569
00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:19.791
-But is everything okay?
-All good.

570
00:49:22.541 --> 00:49:23.875
Now I will make it…

571
00:49:30.083 --> 00:49:31.291
Oh, no!

572
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:35.916
What else can I do?

573
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.625
I need to go to the bathroom.

574
00:49:39.375 --> 00:49:41.541
-Ano, take the medicine.
-Okay.

575
00:49:46.708 --> 00:49:48.375
Who was that, Is?

576
00:49:48.458 --> 00:49:50.708
-Maurin.
-Oh, Maurin.

577
00:49:51.666 --> 00:49:53.166
It's okay, I'll pick it up.

578
00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:55.166
-Should I get Moko?
-No need.

579
00:49:56.625 --> 00:49:57.833
Hello, Maurin?

580
00:49:58.583 --> 00:50:01.000
-A lot, still?
-Does it always take so long?

581
00:50:01.083 --> 00:50:03.708
-Yeah.
-Here's your coffee.

582
00:50:03.791 --> 00:50:05.791
Yes, thank you.

583
00:50:05.875 --> 00:50:08.333
Ais made coffee faster
than you moving a pillar.

584
00:50:09.583 --> 00:50:11.291
-What's the matter?
-Woko…

585
00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:15.208
Even if it's slow, if we're patient…

586
00:50:15.666 --> 00:50:16.708
Why is it doing that?

587
00:50:17.458 --> 00:50:18.416
Oh, no.

588
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:19.750
Oh, no!

589
00:50:23.333 --> 00:50:27.291
Ais, boil some water.
Make more coffee for Moko.

590
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:30.208
it's going to take long.

591
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:34.250
I have to buy more coffee,
this is the last one.

592
00:50:34.333 --> 00:50:37.000
Just use the dregs from that one.

593
00:50:37.083 --> 00:50:39.333
He won't finish and will get acid reflux.

594
00:50:40.666 --> 00:50:41.708
Oh, dear.

595
00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:02.375
Even the sound is different.

596
00:51:03.083 --> 00:51:04.916
It's a distinctive sound.

597
00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:09.833
Is it done, No? Let me see.

598
00:51:13.625 --> 00:51:15.083
You're pretty warm.

599
00:51:16.958 --> 00:51:20.333
Are you warm? Yes, you are.

600
00:51:20.958 --> 00:51:24.333
Eat the porridge first.
After that, take your medicine.

601
00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:26.333
Thank you…

602
00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:29.208
for coming to help Moko.

603
00:51:29.291 --> 00:51:30.750
No problem, No.

604
00:51:31.666 --> 00:51:36.125
These nuts here, don't eat them.
Just eat soft food for now.

605
00:51:37.958 --> 00:51:40.000
But after you chew it, it becomes soft.

606
00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:44.208
That's not how it works, Ano.

607
00:51:48.791 --> 00:51:50.041
I can't imagine.

608
00:51:51.291 --> 00:51:53.625
If you didn't come…

609
00:51:56.291 --> 00:51:57.541
I feel bad for Moko.

610
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:02.166
The laptop kept restarting.

611
00:52:03.291 --> 00:52:04.583
It's a very old laptop.

612
00:52:07.916 --> 00:52:09.166
Next time…

613
00:52:10.583 --> 00:52:14.250
if I get sick… I won't say anything.

614
00:52:18.666 --> 00:52:20.750
I'll endure it as long as I can…

615
00:52:22.166 --> 00:52:23.708
so Moko won't be burdened.

616
00:52:27.416 --> 00:52:28.750
I feel bad for him.

617
00:53:52.416 --> 00:53:56.000
Just like in college.
Didn't sleep to finish assignments.

618
00:53:56.083 --> 00:53:59.083
No time for a shower,
but it's time to rush to campus.

619
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:04.458
Sorry that you had to take care of Ano.

620
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.791
It's okay, Mo.

621
00:54:09.125 --> 00:54:13.333
-I just don't want to be a burden to you.
-No. It's okay.

622
00:54:15.041 --> 00:54:16.416
Enough.

623
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.666
You better think
about the presentation to Mr. Sam.

624
00:54:22.958 --> 00:54:24.833
What kind of person is Mr. Sam?

625
00:54:24.916 --> 00:54:27.583
Will he ask technical questions?

626
00:54:28.833 --> 00:54:31.083
Why are you smiling? Rin, I'm serious.

627
00:54:31.875 --> 00:54:32.833
Maurin?

628
00:54:34.333 --> 00:54:36.750
Rin?

629
00:54:40.958 --> 00:54:42.416
But this is cute, right?

630
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:43.583
Ima will like it.

631
00:54:43.666 --> 00:54:44.791
Here, Ais…

632
00:54:44.875 --> 00:54:45.916
Cute, right?

633
00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:49.875
Please help me with this.
It's Moko's. It has to be perfect.

634
00:54:57.208 --> 00:54:58.583
I got the job.

635
00:55:00.958 --> 00:55:02.041
You are so cool.

636
00:55:03.791 --> 00:55:06.583
We didn't make him
one liter of coffee for nothing.

637
00:55:06.666 --> 00:55:08.708
Ais' hand was sore from stirring.

638
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:10.666
Almost got acid reflux!

639
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:12.541
From making too much coffee.

640
00:55:12.625 --> 00:55:13.666
Osa?

641
00:55:15.625 --> 00:55:17.458
-Moko!
-Osa.

642
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.875
Sorry I couldn't come home earlier.

643
00:55:22.958 --> 00:55:25.916
-It's okay. When did you arrive?
-This afternoon.

644
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.958
How are you? You got a job?

645
00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:29.583
Congratulations.

646
00:55:30.708 --> 00:55:32.666
-Sa?
-Yes, honey?

647
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:35.375
-Have you heated my food?
-Yes. One moment, please.

648
00:55:36.208 --> 00:55:38.000
-Is that Moko?
-Yes.

649
00:55:40.666 --> 00:55:43.458
Moko, heating up food is simple, isn't it?

650
00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:49.250
Hot meal or not, not a problem.
Especially if it's from someone.

651
00:55:49.583 --> 00:55:50.958
Huh?

652
00:55:53.875 --> 00:55:55.875
-You meant these?
-Yes…

653
00:55:55.958 --> 00:56:00.541
I bought this
to celebrate me getting hired.

654
00:56:00.625 --> 00:56:03.250
Can I eat it with rice?
It can be a side dish.

655
00:56:03.333 --> 00:56:06.416
-No. That's martabak…
-Congratulations.

656
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:08.833
Thank you, Nina.

657
00:56:11.291 --> 00:56:13.541
-Moko?
-Kak.

658
00:56:15.583 --> 00:56:17.333
Long time no see.

659
00:56:17.416 --> 00:56:20.000
-You're good?
-I'm good.

660
00:56:20.083 --> 00:56:21.375
You've become skinnier.

661
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:26.208
I heard you just got a job?

662
00:56:27.208 --> 00:56:30.500
That's good. A steady job is a must.

663
00:56:30.583 --> 00:56:32.458
Don't do freelance work.

664
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:35.291
How's your salary?

665
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.708
How much is your salary?

666
00:56:41.125 --> 00:56:44.250
If you're not comfortable,
you don't need to answer.

667
00:56:44.333 --> 00:56:48.458
But if you're just starting a job,
how much can you earn anyway?

668
00:56:50.125 --> 00:56:51.166
Eight million.

669
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:55.000
Eight million? That's not bad.

670
00:56:55.083 --> 00:56:58.166
That was how much I got
when I first started working.

671
00:56:58.791 --> 00:57:00.708
But that was 10 years ago.

672
00:57:00.791 --> 00:57:03.250
Ten years ago, it was a lot.

673
00:57:03.333 --> 00:57:07.000
But it's not bad for now.
That's a good start.

674
00:57:10.666 --> 00:57:12.250
Why do you look troubled?

675
00:57:14.666 --> 00:57:16.500
Because the project is in Anyer.

676
00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:19.583
And?

677
00:57:19.666 --> 00:57:21.333
It's far from…

678
00:57:21.875 --> 00:57:25.750
Oh, yeah. I understand.

679
00:57:26.916 --> 00:57:30.250
But now you have me.

680
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.291
Osa is also here.

681
00:57:32.375 --> 00:57:34.625
So you don't need to worry
about the house.

682
00:57:34.708 --> 00:57:38.125
Don't worry about it.
I can take care of it.

683
00:57:39.708 --> 00:57:41.583
Just focus on your work.

684
00:57:41.666 --> 00:57:43.458
Well, but…

685
00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:44.500
Yes?

686
00:57:44.583 --> 00:57:49.041
I want to make eggs.
You prefer a sunny side up or omelet?

687
00:57:49.125 --> 00:57:51.833
Omelet, of course.
I've never liked sunny side ups.

688
00:57:51.916 --> 00:57:54.750
-Wait, make one for him too.
-Do you want egg?

689
00:57:54.833 --> 00:57:55.875
What do you like?

690
00:57:55.958 --> 00:57:57.500
-I have eaten…
-It's okay.

691
00:57:57.583 --> 00:57:59.333
Just an omelette. He likes it.

692
00:57:59.416 --> 00:58:02.041
-I've already eaten.
-Make him an omelette.

693
00:58:02.125 --> 00:58:03.166
-What?
-Omelette.

694
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:05.666
Yes, omelette. For the others too. Okay.

695
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.833
Okay, then.

696
00:58:11.583 --> 00:58:15.666
I suggest you take the job in Anyer.

697
00:58:16.208 --> 00:58:18.291
Take it, okay?

698
00:58:18.375 --> 00:58:19.916
You rest first.

699
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.125
Sit.

700
00:58:21.208 --> 00:58:23.708
I brought a lot of things. There. Okay?

701
00:58:23.791 --> 00:58:26.041
-Show them to Moko, okay?
-Yes.

702
00:58:26.125 --> 00:58:27.750
-Thank you, Eka.
-Sure.

703
00:58:32.541 --> 00:58:33.583
Ano?

704
00:58:34.375 --> 00:58:35.500
What?

705
00:58:35.583 --> 00:58:37.916
That's red velvet martabak, No.

706
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.250
Red usually means good luck.

707
00:58:42.583 --> 00:58:43.416
It's good.

708
00:58:49.958 --> 00:58:53.708
What? Want one? There's a lot in the back.

709
00:58:55.166 --> 00:58:56.500
-Weird stomach.
-Whatever.

710
00:58:59.458 --> 00:59:01.375
This is like mango sticky rice.

711
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:04.708
From Thailand.

712
00:59:05.625 --> 00:59:07.250
He really ate it, Mo?

713
00:59:07.333 --> 00:59:10.833
Yes, he really ate it.
It was red velvet martabak too.

714
00:59:10.916 --> 00:59:13.000
Ano!

715
00:59:14.625 --> 00:59:16.166
So, it's a full house now, Mo?

716
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:23.041
Eka and Osa are sleeping in Atmo's room,
where I usually sleep with Ima.

717
00:59:25.708 --> 00:59:28.000
So, you're sleeping
in the front room again?

718
00:59:28.083 --> 00:59:29.458
-Yes.
-With Ima?

719
00:59:29.541 --> 00:59:33.375
No, Ima and Nina sleep
in Nina's room, along with Ais.

720
00:59:37.625 --> 00:59:38.958
The timing's perfect.

721
00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:41.958
Eka and Osa are back home.

722
00:59:43.416 --> 00:59:44.708
Maybe this is fate?

723
00:59:49.083 --> 00:59:51.416
So I get to have my own life.

724
01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:06.500
Why does it feel strange?

725
01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:13.500
To think that I can have my own life…

726
01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:17.458
why does it feel wrong?

727
01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:25.083
It's not strange, Mo.

728
01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.416
I understand how you feel.

729
01:00:34.083 --> 01:00:37.833
I know how it feels
to prioritize yourself…

730
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.416
and feel guilty about it.

731
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:48.583
When you had to be the father…

732
01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:52.125
to those children…

733
01:00:54.708 --> 01:00:58.333
And then
you didn't continue your education.

734
01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:04.125
You've dedicated your time
to take care of them.

735
01:01:07.208 --> 01:01:08.583
There was a time…

736
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.375
when I hated myself so much.

737
01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:18.625
I hated myself because I thought…

738
01:01:20.416 --> 01:01:24.333
that your priority was us.

739
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.083
But it turned out
that your priority was the children.

740
01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:37.583
I really hated it every time
it crossed my mind.

741
01:01:41.083 --> 01:01:44.666
It made me feel like
I was a horrible person.

742
01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:51.333
I felt selfish.

743
01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:57.208
And then you…

744
01:02:01.083 --> 01:02:02.041
We broke up.

745
01:02:10.666 --> 01:02:12.125
I'm sorry, Rin.

746
01:03:01.833 --> 01:03:02.875
Oh, right.

747
01:03:04.625 --> 01:03:05.666
Mr. Albert…

748
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.125
he gave out vouchers, Mo.

749
01:03:09.208 --> 01:03:10.583
To stay at his resort.

750
01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:16.666
Let's take the kids.

751
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:21.958
Come on. Let's all go.

752
01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:25.625
The cottage can
accommodate them. Seriously.

753
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:29.666
We also have to evaluate the old resort.

754
01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:33.500
So, when we build the new one,
we know how it should be.

755
01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:36.208
Am I right?

756
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:41.166
You said it'd be good for Ima.
For her sensory skills.

757
01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:45.666
It's good for her to walk on the sand
and play in the sea.

758
01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:52.583
You mentioned texture.

759
01:03:54.666 --> 01:03:56.416
So she won't be a picky eater.

760
01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:03.291
Besides, it's been a while
since they went on a holiday.

761
01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:08.458
Take them, okay?

762
01:04:13.166 --> 01:04:14.750
Thank you, Rin.

763
01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:00.208
Look at that. Over there!

764
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:40.708
Thank you for taking us on this holiday.

765
01:05:42.333 --> 01:05:43.875
You should thank Maurin.

766
01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:47.000
Thank you, Maurin.

767
01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:48.833
Thank you.

768
01:05:49.458 --> 01:05:50.583
Thank you.

769
01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:52.250
Thank you, Maurin.

770
01:05:52.333 --> 01:05:54.291
Yes, you're welcome.

771
01:05:58.416 --> 01:06:01.083
So, you will work here, Moko?

772
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.250
Not here.

773
01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:05.916
The cottage will be over there.

774
01:06:09.916 --> 01:06:11.333
How long will it take?

775
01:06:12.291 --> 01:06:13.333
I don't know, Wo.

776
01:06:15.291 --> 01:06:19.416
And I'm sorry
that I'll be away from home for a while.

777
01:06:20.458 --> 01:06:21.583
Don't apologize.

778
01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:26.583
We should be thanking you.
You're working for us.

779
01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:31.458
Thank you.

780
01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:33.541
No need to thank me.

781
01:06:33.625 --> 01:06:36.291
That's my responsibility.

782
01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:41.375
Thank you.

783
01:06:41.458 --> 01:06:42.958
Ano!

784
01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:45.000
-Thank you.
-Woko!

785
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.833
-Thank you.
-Why are you copying them?

786
01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:13.708
Excuse me, here's the coconut.

787
01:07:13.791 --> 01:07:15.791
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

788
01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:22.833
Ais?

789
01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:26.708
Ais!

790
01:07:31.791 --> 01:07:35.041
Sorry, Ais is my relative.

791
01:07:38.291 --> 01:07:42.291
I'm Moko, Mr. Nanang's former student.

792
01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:45.291
Oh, right. Nanang told me about you.

793
01:07:45.916 --> 01:07:48.958
Hello. I'm Erna, Nanang's relative.

794
01:07:49.458 --> 01:07:51.000
-Nice to meet you.
-Yes.

795
01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:55.041
Thank you for taking care of Ais.

796
01:07:56.333 --> 01:08:01.166
If she doesn't behave,
just bring her back to me.

797
01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:08.541
My husband and I had offered
to look after Ais.

798
01:08:08.625 --> 01:08:12.458
But Nanang seems to have
his own point of view.

799
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.541
Excuse me.

800
01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:20.000
-Yes.
-Sure.

801
01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:33.666
-Got you!
-Fine, you want to do three versus one?

802
01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:43.500
So, the owner of this resort
is the one you'll be working with?

803
01:08:43.583 --> 01:08:44.625
Yes.

804
01:08:45.166 --> 01:08:49.958
This is a good opportunity, Moko.
You have to work hard.

805
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.250
There is no comfortable work.

806
01:08:53.958 --> 01:08:57.916
Don't tell me you want
that work-life balance thing?

807
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.500
It's a meaningless term
coined by lazy people.

808
01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:08.291
Yes, Mo. When we were in Melbourne,
Eka worked really hard.

809
01:09:08.375 --> 01:09:11.000
-That's right.
-All day and night.

810
01:09:11.791 --> 01:09:13.125
Everyone did.

811
01:09:13.666 --> 01:09:16.291
Sometimes, a lot of passengers,
sometimes none.

812
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.666
-Passengers?
-Guests!

813
01:09:19.666 --> 01:09:22.916
She meant clients, Moko.
That's how a business is.

814
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.500
Sometimes it's busy, sometimes it's not.

815
01:09:25.583 --> 01:09:28.083
Sometimes one or two people
stayed at our house.

816
01:09:28.166 --> 01:09:30.000
Guests at the house.

817
01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:31.833
I thought you were an Uber driver.

818
01:09:31.916 --> 01:09:33.958
Of course not.

819
01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:37.791
Why leave home and travel so far
just to work as a driver?

820
01:09:37.875 --> 01:09:39.208
But that's fine too.

821
01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:42.916
So, what else are you considering now?

822
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.291
We've surveyed all the way here.
You will take the job, right?

823
01:09:51.875 --> 01:09:53.875
Yes, I'll definitely take it.

824
01:09:53.958 --> 01:09:55.583
That's great.

825
01:09:56.291 --> 01:09:59.583
Actually, I'm still worried
about the children.

826
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:03.708
I'm worried about Ima.
The project is in Anyer.

827
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:05.708
While they're at home and…

828
01:10:05.791 --> 01:10:08.666
Yes, of course I get that.

829
01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.916
Listen, Mo. Osa and I…

830
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.125
we know how much you've struggled.

831
01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:21.416
You struggled for two years
and even cancelled your Master's.

832
01:10:22.208 --> 01:10:25.958
I know that you had been working
as a freelancer.

833
01:10:26.041 --> 01:10:28.208
Sometimes you earn money,
sometimes you don't.

834
01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:31.750
You raise Ima
as if she were your own child.

835
01:10:31.833 --> 01:10:35.875
Not to mention, you also help pay
for your nieces' and nephews' school fees.

836
01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:41.750
You are amazing.
You're one of a kind, Mo.

837
01:10:41.833 --> 01:10:45.958
No one would willingly sacrifice their
life for their nieces or nephews.

838
01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:47.083
You're the only one.

839
01:10:47.583 --> 01:10:50.375
And you've sacrificed a lot, Mo.

840
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.708
Woko gave up a lot of things as well.
He gave up his plans to go to college.

841
01:10:56.791 --> 01:10:59.750
Woko is happy doing that.

842
01:10:59.833 --> 01:11:01.583
Every morning I see him.

843
01:11:01.666 --> 01:11:05.916
He plays guitar every morning.
That's what he wants.

844
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.666
Even if you send him to college,
he'll probably be expelled in no time.

845
01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.000
Not to mention Ano.

846
01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:16.750
Woko, Nina, Ima… I understand.
They're your biological nephew and nieces.

847
01:11:16.833 --> 01:11:18.041
But Ano?

848
01:11:18.125 --> 01:11:21.666
Ano is Atmo's nephew.
So he's my nephew too.

849
01:11:22.458 --> 01:11:24.958
Fine, but please.

850
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:30.041
Please tell him he eats too much.
Twice as much as the other kids.

851
01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:31.916
Even more than I do.

852
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.791
-Honey, don't say it like that.
-But you saw it too, right?

853
01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.958
He can finish all the food if we let him.

854
01:11:39.041 --> 01:11:42.291
Yes, Mo. It's true. Ano really eats a lot.

855
01:11:42.375 --> 01:11:43.333
See?

856
01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:50.375
Look, this needs to be discussed.
You know why?

857
01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:54.333
Because I care about you. I do.

858
01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:56.875
All of us here care about you.

859
01:11:57.416 --> 01:11:59.500
Yes. Am I right, Maurin?

860
01:12:02.041 --> 01:12:03.958
This kid is great.

861
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:07.916
Sacrificing his youth
for his nephews and nieces.

862
01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:12.833
In Australia, the sandwich generation.
Right? What is it called here?

863
01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.666
-Same?
-Same.

864
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:19.583
People who are stuck with burdens
they shouldn't be responsible for.

865
01:12:19.666 --> 01:12:23.375
Moko is the sandwich generation.
I feel bad for your girlfriend.

866
01:12:24.875 --> 01:12:25.833
Right?

867
01:12:28.125 --> 01:12:32.000
See? Maurin is quiet because she agrees.

868
01:12:34.875 --> 01:12:40.708
Look, about the children,
let Eka and I handle them.

869
01:12:40.791 --> 01:12:44.500
It will be good for them
to have parental figures again.

870
01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:45.625
Right.

871
01:12:46.833 --> 01:12:51.916
Who is the other kid?
She's not family, but lives here.

872
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.291
-Don't mind it.
-Her name?

873
01:12:53.375 --> 01:12:55.375
-Ais.
-Yes, her.

874
01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:57.333
Yes, Mo, what about her?

875
01:12:57.416 --> 01:13:00.458
She has a relative here. I was surprised.

876
01:13:01.458 --> 01:13:06.333
You heard it yourself.
Her relative were willing to take her in.

877
01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:09.541
Why did her father bring her to you?
You're not her family.

878
01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:15.375
You don't have to act like a hero, Mo.

879
01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:19.708
You are nice,
but you can't help everyone.

880
01:13:21.125 --> 01:13:22.750
I've always believed

881
01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:26.625
the considerate
will always meet the inconsiderate.

882
01:13:26.708 --> 01:13:28.458
You know which one you are.

883
01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:43.166
Listen, I understand that right now
you have a lot on your mind.

884
01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:48.458
Let me do it.
I will talk to her relative.

885
01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:54.625
Okay? I know how to speak nicely.
I'm an adult.

886
01:13:54.708 --> 01:13:56.125
The relative is here, right?

887
01:13:56.208 --> 01:13:57.500
Let me do the talking.

888
01:13:57.583 --> 01:14:01.250
You just focus on what you're going to do.

889
01:14:02.291 --> 01:14:03.250
Okay?

890
01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:12.541
Osa…

891
01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:27.250
It's okay.

892
01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:32.291
It's all right.

893
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:38.208
Oh, yeah.

894
01:15:43.708 --> 01:15:45.250
Keep in touch, Ais.

895
01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.041
You too.

896
01:15:51.333 --> 01:15:52.625
I'm going now.

897
01:15:57.375 --> 01:15:59.416
-Hey, take care.
-Hey.

898
01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.958
-I'm off now, Woko.
-Yes.

899
01:16:01.041 --> 01:16:02.500
Bye, No!

900
01:16:02.583 --> 01:16:04.208
-Take care, okay?
-Yeah.

901
01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:08.458
-Take care, Ais.
-Bye!

902
01:16:08.541 --> 01:16:12.416
-Bye, Ais!
-Bye!

903
01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.416
Bye!

904
01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:17.166
Take care.

905
01:16:18.083 --> 01:16:19.875
Bye!

906
01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:21.041
Take care, Ais.

907
01:16:21.125 --> 01:16:23.666
-Bye!
-Bye!

908
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:26.833
-Bye!
-Bye!

909
01:16:28.291 --> 01:16:29.625
Call us often!

910
01:16:30.458 --> 01:16:32.375
Bye!

911
01:16:43.416 --> 01:16:45.000
Did you notice?

912
01:16:45.541 --> 01:16:47.208
Between the three of us…

913
01:16:48.083 --> 01:16:52.375
Agnes, me, and you.

914
01:16:55.083 --> 01:16:56.875
You are the smartest.

915
01:16:57.791 --> 01:16:59.291
The most diligent.

916
01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:02.708
And the most obedient to our parents.

917
01:17:06.958 --> 01:17:10.666
You deserve the most happiness.

918
01:17:27.708 --> 01:17:31.458
Carry her. Take her on a walk, so…

919
01:17:31.541 --> 01:17:33.875
Ima, come with me, will you?

920
01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:36.375
Poor thing, she keeps crying.

921
01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:40.750
-Ima, want me to carry you?
-Pick her up.

922
01:17:40.833 --> 01:17:43.000
You want this? I have the one in green.

923
01:17:43.083 --> 01:17:45.583
Here. You want to hold it?

924
01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:30.333
Rin, are you sure the cottage
is not too big?

925
01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:32.750
Is this too big?

926
01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.125
Yes, Mr. Albert asked for 20.

927
01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:38.458
If we add two here,
they'll be too cramped together.

928
01:18:38.541 --> 01:18:42.416
Actually, Moko and I have discussed that.

929
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.791
If--

930
01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:46.166
-What do you say, Mo?
-Yes, well…

931
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:47.916
I'm sorry in advance.

932
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:53.500
Don't you think it will be better
if we make it big?

933
01:18:54.083 --> 01:18:55.000
Why?

934
01:18:55.708 --> 01:18:58.916
Because Mr. Sam once mentioned

935
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.250
that the interior orientation
for this cottage

936
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.416
must be functional.

937
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.875
That's right. Okay.

938
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:10.833
But this has to be readjusted.

939
01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:12.208
Yes.

940
01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:13.708
Yes, okay.

941
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:16.875
Actually, we can still allocate
some space.

942
01:19:18.291 --> 01:19:20.000
-Sorry.
-Your phone.

943
01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:23.916
Answer it. I want to make coffee anyway.

944
01:19:24.666 --> 01:19:25.625
Thank you.

945
01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:27.291
But we need to take some out.

946
01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:29.333
-All right. I'll try.
-Take a look first.

947
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:36.750
Hello?

948
01:19:37.708 --> 01:19:38.833
Hello, Moko.

949
01:19:39.416 --> 01:19:40.916
Yes, Eka. What's up?

950
01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.125
How are you there?
Is work going all right?

951
01:19:44.708 --> 01:19:45.916
All good.

952
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.208
You're in a good health?

953
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:48.583
I am.

954
01:19:49.166 --> 01:19:53.333
Well, I'm calling

955
01:19:53.416 --> 01:19:58.500
to give you an update.
Everything is fine and good at home.

956
01:19:59.041 --> 01:20:05.125
But there's this one thing.
The roof is leaking.

957
01:20:05.208 --> 01:20:08.875
Perhaps because
it hasn't been checked in years.

958
01:20:08.958 --> 01:20:11.750
Okay, I'll send the money now.

959
01:20:11.833 --> 01:20:13.625
How much does it cost?

960
01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:19.500
I actually have all the details
for the repair costs. I'll send them now.

961
01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:21.375
Yes, thank you.

962
01:20:21.458 --> 01:20:23.500
-Bye, Moko.
-Bye!

963
01:20:47.875 --> 01:20:49.875
Hi. So here's the thing…

964
01:20:49.958 --> 01:20:50.916
Yes?

965
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.208
Osa has a reunion with her friends,
since she just got back.

966
01:20:55.291 --> 01:21:00.208
I'm thinking maybe
I can buy her something

967
01:21:00.291 --> 01:21:03.083
to cheer her up.
She's tired, taking care of the children.

968
01:21:03.166 --> 01:21:05.958
I'm planning to buy her a bag.

969
01:21:06.041 --> 01:21:08.583
We're all chipping in.
Do you want to help out?

970
01:21:08.666 --> 01:21:10.125
-Okay.
-Can you help out?

971
01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:12.666
All right. I'll buy the bag in a bit.

972
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:15.166
Can you transfer the money now?

973
01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:16.666
-I have the money.
-Okay.

974
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:18.916
I have it. I'll send the money now, okay?

975
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.166
Okay. Thank you, Mo.

976
01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:29.333
-Hey, Mo.
-Hey. What's up?

977
01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:33.416
Please ask Mr. Naryo
about the plan for this.

978
01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.666
Hello, Mo?

979
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:35.791
Yes?

980
01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:39.000
The water pump at home broke, Mo.

981
01:21:39.083 --> 01:21:40.750
Oh, no. How come?

982
01:21:40.833 --> 01:21:42.666
It's been three days.

983
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:46.666
It was fixed,
but with my money. It's okay.

984
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:48.708
Okay. I'll send the money now.

985
01:21:48.791 --> 01:21:50.500
No need.

986
01:21:50.583 --> 01:21:53.291
No, don't say that.
I want to pay you back.

987
01:21:54.083 --> 01:21:55.208
Okay.

988
01:22:06.708 --> 01:22:08.416
The number you're calling is busy.

989
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:12.791
Please leave a voice message
by pressing star and the number.

990
01:22:12.875 --> 01:22:15.000
The cost is Rp 400 per minute.

991
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.125
Moko? Are you busy?

992
01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:22.750
Not really. What's up?

993
01:22:22.833 --> 01:22:23.958
How's work?

994
01:22:24.041 --> 01:22:25.750
Everything's good.

995
01:22:25.833 --> 01:22:28.791
That's good. Listen…

996
01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:32.583
I think the kids are tired
eating homecooked meals.

997
01:22:32.666 --> 01:22:34.958
I should take them out to eat.

998
01:22:35.041 --> 01:22:37.708
What do they usually like?

999
01:22:41.416 --> 01:22:43.416
You can take them out to eat.

1000
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.083
Is that so? I can do it once in a while.

1001
01:22:46.166 --> 01:22:49.541
But here's the thing, Mo.
Something's wrong with my credit card.

1002
01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:53.000
It's issued by an Australian bank.
I don't have a bank account here.

1003
01:22:53.083 --> 01:22:55.958
Do you have… Well…

1004
01:22:56.041 --> 01:22:58.833
Yes, of course. For the kids.

1005
01:22:58.916 --> 01:23:01.791
Right. Just for the kids, Mo.

1006
01:23:01.875 --> 01:23:04.125
Maybe just two million.

1007
01:23:04.875 --> 01:23:07.833
Right. Thank you, Mo.

1008
01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.708
The number cannot receive calls.

1009
01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:13.541
Please leave a voice message
by pressing the star…

1010
01:24:12.291 --> 01:24:13.333
Mo?

1011
01:24:14.791 --> 01:24:16.000
Yes, Rin?

1012
01:24:17.416 --> 01:24:19.708
Haven't you sent them money every month?

1013
01:24:23.041 --> 01:24:24.000
I have.

1014
01:24:26.458 --> 01:24:27.583
It's okay, Rin.

1015
01:24:29.125 --> 01:24:30.791
But I'm worried.

1016
01:24:31.625 --> 01:24:33.458
Why is it so hard to contact the kids?

1017
01:24:36.625 --> 01:24:38.875
What do you mean "it's okay", Mo?

1018
01:24:41.583 --> 01:24:43.791
It's okay
because that's my responsibility.

1019
01:24:43.875 --> 01:24:45.083
I get it.

1020
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.375
But you've set the amount
that you will send every month.

1021
01:24:50.458 --> 01:24:54.333
If you keep doing this, Mo,
it won't be good for the kids.

1022
01:24:55.041 --> 01:24:58.416
-But it's for their needs, Rin.
-And what about your needs?

1023
01:25:02.833 --> 01:25:05.291
Living and lifestyle expenses
are different.

1024
01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:10.750
You should be paying
for their living expenses.

1025
01:25:10.833 --> 01:25:12.291
Not their lifestyle.

1026
01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:14.875
The cost of basic necessities to live.

1027
01:25:17.708 --> 01:25:21.416
Money for food, accommodation and school.
Take care of those.

1028
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:25.958
But the lifestyle?

1029
01:25:26.041 --> 01:25:27.625
To buy a new cellphone…

1030
01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:32.916
to hang out at some coffee shop,
don't worry about it.

1031
01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:40.583
You can calculate living expenses.
But lifestyle…

1032
01:25:41.791 --> 01:25:44.291
If we keep following it, it's endless.

1033
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:46.791
Trust me.

1034
01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:51.125
I'm also part of the sandwich generation.

1035
01:25:55.666 --> 01:25:59.125
My chat with my dad
looks like a bank statement.

1036
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.416
That's how it is.

1037
01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.875
Four days ago my dad asked
for four million to buy dentures.

1038
01:26:07.666 --> 01:26:12.375
Two days ago, he asked for money
for the electricity bill, food and stuff.

1039
01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:14.291
So, there. Like a bank statement.

1040
01:26:15.458 --> 01:26:17.708
I only have my father, child and wife.

1041
01:26:17.791 --> 01:26:19.416
You? How many people? Five?

1042
01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:21.875
-Five.
-Seven.

1043
01:26:22.916 --> 01:26:24.625
Eka and Osa?

1044
01:26:24.708 --> 01:26:27.083
Are you supporting…

1045
01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.875
seven people? Seven relatives?

1046
01:26:30.791 --> 01:26:31.750
Hmm.

1047
01:26:36.916 --> 01:26:39.041
That seems crowded. That's a lot.

1048
01:26:40.208 --> 01:26:41.416
Hey.

1049
01:26:43.083 --> 01:26:46.125
Mr. Sam is really happy with your idea.

1050
01:26:47.791 --> 01:26:48.833
Yes.

1051
01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.416
He wants you
to do the presentation tomorrow.

1052
01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:55.500
Is that okay?

1053
01:26:56.333 --> 01:27:00.541
Of course it's okay. You have to try, Mo.

1054
01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:05.333
I'm happy for you.

1055
01:27:05.416 --> 01:27:07.083
That's Mr. Sam.

1056
01:27:07.166 --> 01:27:08.833
He responds to potential.

1057
01:27:10.125 --> 01:27:13.041
I just don't have
anything to do tomorrow. Sorry.

1058
01:27:15.916 --> 01:27:17.291
Thank you.

1059
01:27:23.833 --> 01:27:24.833
Thank you, Rin.

1060
01:27:26.916 --> 01:27:28.625
You're welcome, Mo.

1061
01:27:31.416 --> 01:27:32.625
I also want to thank you.

1062
01:27:33.625 --> 01:27:35.541
I didn't do anything.

1063
01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:38.958
-Hmm.
-"Hmm," what?

1064
01:27:40.166 --> 01:27:42.416
You're going to do
a presentation tomorrow.

1065
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:46.375
Don't say that, Rin. I…
What if I do something wrong?

1066
01:27:46.458 --> 01:27:50.333
-I'll toss you into the water. Can I?
-Seriously. What if tomorrow Mr…

1067
01:27:51.458 --> 01:27:53.083
I'm serious.

1068
01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.083
A little to the right

1069
01:28:05.875 --> 01:28:08.291
Yes, you go up. Up a little.

1070
01:28:08.958 --> 01:28:11.166
Slowly, lower it a little. Yes.

1071
01:28:12.625 --> 01:28:13.708
Excuse us, sir.

1072
01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.125
Let's start the meeting.

1073
01:28:18.208 --> 01:28:20.375
Sorry for the wait.

1074
01:28:20.916 --> 01:28:24.583
Okay, then. Good morning, everyone.

1075
01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:27.333
Thank you, Mr. Albert,
for the opportunity.

1076
01:28:27.416 --> 01:28:29.375
Today we will present the design.

1077
01:28:29.458 --> 01:28:30.875
Mr. Bayu will--

1078
01:28:30.958 --> 01:28:35.541
Oh, Sam, I have notes for the interior.

1079
01:28:38.791 --> 01:28:43.541
The interior design needs to be
much more unique than the current one.

1080
01:28:44.583 --> 01:28:48.916
Okay, let's go straight
to the interior, shall we?

1081
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.750
As we discussed yesterday, Mr. Albert…

1082
01:28:52.291 --> 01:28:54.541
Moko will be doing the presentation today.

1083
01:28:54.625 --> 01:28:56.166
-Okay.
-Yes.

1084
01:29:01.875 --> 01:29:02.708
Good morning.

1085
01:29:05.166 --> 01:29:10.291
As Mr. Albert said yesterday,
this resort will be a family resort.

1086
01:29:10.375 --> 01:29:16.000
That's why I designed the interior
with that vision in mind.

1087
01:29:16.083 --> 01:29:19.166
Sorry. Just the simplest thing.

1088
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:24.125
About the choice of furniture
in the restaurant.

1089
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.458
Right, that one.

1090
01:29:28.041 --> 01:29:30.208
Those chairs without arm rests…

1091
01:29:31.208 --> 01:29:34.791
they will look like a downgrade, Sam.

1092
01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:40.875
Well…

1093
01:29:40.958 --> 01:29:43.041
There is a reason for that. Just a moment.

1094
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Maurin, may I?

1095
01:29:53.541 --> 01:29:57.333
When a mother's eating
while holding her baby…

1096
01:29:58.041 --> 01:30:00.750
the baby has to be on the side.

1097
01:30:01.416 --> 01:30:04.625
Because while she's eating,
the baby could get food spilled on them.

1098
01:30:06.583 --> 01:30:07.625
Table width?

1099
01:30:09.791 --> 01:30:11.416
Too big, in my opinion.

1100
01:30:12.541 --> 01:30:13.708
Okay, sir.

1101
01:30:15.125 --> 01:30:17.500
The width of the table
must be pretty wide.

1102
01:30:17.583 --> 01:30:20.833
I know this will reduce
the number of tables in the room.

1103
01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:25.333
But when a family sits together,
eating with toddlers,

1104
01:30:25.875 --> 01:30:28.958
certain items should be kept
out of the child's reach.

1105
01:30:29.041 --> 01:30:33.333
It can be dangerous.
Like knives, forks, glasses.

1106
01:30:34.625 --> 01:30:36.125
What's the family room for?

1107
01:30:38.291 --> 01:30:40.666
We're making a resort, not a mall.

1108
01:30:43.916 --> 01:30:45.250
Yes.

1109
01:30:45.333 --> 01:30:48.791
But this is a family resort, right?

1110
01:30:52.916 --> 01:30:55.625
Because the one who changes the diaper…

1111
01:30:57.083 --> 01:31:00.416
and takes the child to the toilet
isn't always the mother.

1112
01:31:02.166 --> 01:31:03.916
Fathers do those things too.

1113
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.708
And if the child is a girl,
it's going to be difficult.

1114
01:31:08.208 --> 01:31:09.666
In the nursery room…

1115
01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:13.416
they will see the mothers
who are breastfeeding.

1116
01:31:14.083 --> 01:31:17.750
So if another adult comes in,
it would be uncomfortable.

1117
01:31:26.166 --> 01:31:28.833
But I understand we have to respond…

1118
01:31:29.583 --> 01:31:32.291
to the current
social media marketing strategy.

1119
01:31:32.916 --> 01:31:35.833
At the resort,
there should be lots of photo spots.

1120
01:31:36.875 --> 01:31:40.333
But actually,
we can create a specific branding

1121
01:31:40.958 --> 01:31:42.958
that this family resort

1122
01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:47.458
is very concerned
about the comfort of a family.

1123
01:31:51.166 --> 01:31:52.458
How about this, then?

1124
01:31:53.458 --> 01:31:54.625
The cottage space…

1125
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.125
is too big for me.

1126
01:31:59.958 --> 01:32:01.875
I asked for a minimalist design.

1127
01:32:02.458 --> 01:32:04.750
So we can build 30 cottages.

1128
01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:07.958
Okay, sir.

1129
01:32:12.458 --> 01:32:15.125
Actually, when a family is on holiday…

1130
01:32:16.833 --> 01:32:18.500
all they need is to be together.

1131
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:25.750
A lot of children don't get
to spend time with their parents

1132
01:32:25.833 --> 01:32:27.833
because the parents are busy with work.

1133
01:32:36.541 --> 01:32:39.958
Therefore, the cottage
that I designed is bigger,

1134
01:32:40.041 --> 01:32:42.375
so they can be together.

1135
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:47.291
Plus, we also provide extra beds.

1136
01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:57.583
Sam, no offense, okay?

1137
01:32:58.958 --> 01:33:00.333
The design you made

1138
01:33:01.416 --> 01:33:04.041
is not what I asked for.
I can call it off.

1139
01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:09.333
For the next draft,

1140
01:33:10.458 --> 01:33:13.375
I want you to make
a smaller cottage space.

1141
01:33:16.708 --> 01:33:17.708
Give me the date.

1142
01:33:23.458 --> 01:33:25.000
-I can't, sir.
-The date?

1143
01:33:25.083 --> 01:33:26.291
I can't, sir!

1144
01:33:26.375 --> 01:33:29.833
You need to change the vision then.
Don't be a family resort.

1145
01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:35.375
When a family is on vacation,

1146
01:33:36.291 --> 01:33:37.708
they want to be together.

1147
01:33:37.791 --> 01:33:39.208
That's the whole point.

1148
01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:43.458
Our cottage is not the thing
that should leave an impression.

1149
01:33:45.083 --> 01:33:48.333
But the memory of them
spending time together.

1150
01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:50.666
You, get out.

1151
01:33:52.708 --> 01:33:54.333
I'm done with you.

1152
01:33:58.708 --> 01:33:59.750
Okay, sir.

1153
01:34:06.958 --> 01:34:08.166
One more thing, sir.

1154
01:34:10.166 --> 01:34:11.708
Your painting is upside down.

1155
01:34:24.333 --> 01:34:28.375
All the points we just discussed,
I will do it myself later.

1156
01:34:29.041 --> 01:34:30.916
Okay.

1157
01:34:32.541 --> 01:34:34.375
-Thank you, Albert.
-Thank you, Sam.

1158
01:34:40.791 --> 01:34:42.416
Mr. Albert, I apologize.

1159
01:34:52.166 --> 01:34:53.291
If you could redo it…

1160
01:34:55.375 --> 01:34:56.750
what would you say to him?

1161
01:35:00.125 --> 01:35:01.291
The same thing.

1162
01:35:02.333 --> 01:35:03.541
But maybe more politely.

1163
01:35:08.375 --> 01:35:11.375
Do you remember
the project for your entrance test?

1164
01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:14.916
I do.

1165
01:35:15.583 --> 01:35:17.000
That was my first project.

1166
01:35:19.916 --> 01:35:21.125
I failed.

1167
01:35:22.333 --> 01:35:24.208
I presented it the same way you did.

1168
01:35:30.083 --> 01:35:31.708
You do that one more time,

1169
01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:34.666
and I will fire you.

1170
01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:39.541
Yes, sir.

1171
01:35:43.125 --> 01:35:45.166
Thank you, sir. And I'm sorry.

1172
01:35:47.583 --> 01:35:49.916
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1173
01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:12.375
Maurin, I'm sorry.

1174
01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:17.833
You miss the kids?

1175
01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.333
Moko?

1176
01:36:42.166 --> 01:36:46.875
-Ais, you're selling drinks now?
-Yes, I'm helping Auntie Erna.

1177
01:36:46.958 --> 01:36:48.208
No school?

1178
01:36:49.625 --> 01:36:52.291
It's Saturday. No school on Saturday.

1179
01:36:53.958 --> 01:36:56.291
Take a seat please. I'll call Auntie Erna.

1180
01:36:56.833 --> 01:36:59.000
-Later.
-Later?

1181
01:37:09.541 --> 01:37:11.666
-Ais.
-Yes?

1182
01:37:12.666 --> 01:37:14.250
Do you miss playing the piano?

1183
01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:19.875
I do.

1184
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.375
Actually, it's Dad that I miss.

1185
01:37:30.291 --> 01:37:32.541
Because, I don't know…

1186
01:37:34.333 --> 01:37:36.166
Every time I play the piano…

1187
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:41.791
it feels like my dad is here.

1188
01:37:42.416 --> 01:37:43.625
With me.

1189
01:37:46.541 --> 01:37:47.750
I'm weird, huh?

1190
01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:51.541
Have you felt like that?

1191
01:37:52.791 --> 01:37:57.416
Doing something just to feel
that the person is still here?

1192
01:38:02.625 --> 01:38:04.041
Ais.

1193
01:38:06.333 --> 01:38:08.750
Have you heard from your dad at all?

1194
01:38:15.791 --> 01:38:22.458
I tried to contact him multiple times,
but never get a response.

1195
01:38:25.416 --> 01:38:27.791
I don't think he's coming back.

1196
01:38:45.625 --> 01:38:46.958
This is Ais.

1197
01:38:47.041 --> 01:38:50.125
Hi, nice to meet you.

1198
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.125
Would you like a drink?

1199
01:38:52.916 --> 01:38:55.583
-Anything is fine.
-Okay.

1200
01:39:06.458 --> 01:39:11.000
That day Dad brought me to your house,

1201
01:39:11.583 --> 01:39:16.541
I knew he wouldn't come back to get me.

1202
01:39:18.333 --> 01:39:21.541
I knew because…

1203
01:39:22.166 --> 01:39:24.250
I had heard Dad and Mom fighting.

1204
01:39:26.583 --> 01:39:31.000
Neither of them wanted to
take care of me if they split up.

1205
01:39:37.291 --> 01:39:40.125
But I also hesitated at that time.

1206
01:39:40.666 --> 01:39:46.208
When Dad told me to choose
between living here with Aunt Erna

1207
01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:48.458
or with you in Jakarta.

1208
01:39:50.166 --> 01:39:54.875
But personally, I feel bad for Aunt Erna.

1209
01:39:55.666 --> 01:39:57.541
She's also struggling here.

1210
01:40:02.375 --> 01:40:06.000
But turned out,
your life in Jakarta was not easy either.

1211
01:40:08.416 --> 01:40:09.541
Like…

1212
01:40:11.625 --> 01:40:14.791
You already have four children
that you have to take care of.

1213
01:40:15.958 --> 01:40:17.583
A lot of people depending on you.

1214
01:40:20.416 --> 01:40:24.708
And suddenly I showed up.

1215
01:40:29.041 --> 01:40:30.375
I'm sorry.

1216
01:40:37.333 --> 01:40:39.875
Well, my dad…

1217
01:40:43.208 --> 01:40:44.750
and my mom,

1218
01:40:45.833 --> 01:40:51.125
you, and now Auntie Erna.

1219
01:40:52.375 --> 01:40:53.583
I feel like…

1220
01:40:55.375 --> 01:40:59.333
wherever I go, I always end up
being a burden to others.

1221
01:41:10.875 --> 01:41:12.208
Ais.

1222
01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:14.083
Yes?

1223
01:41:14.166 --> 01:41:15.583
If you press this…

1224
01:41:16.958 --> 01:41:18.166
can you hear the note?

1225
01:41:19.666 --> 01:41:20.875
Press it?

1226
01:42:39.166 --> 01:42:40.666
Thank you for visiting me.

1227
01:42:41.833 --> 01:42:45.125
I promise I will do better.

1228
01:42:47.083 --> 01:42:51.416
So I won't be a burden to Auntie Erna
or anyone else.

1229
01:42:54.958 --> 01:42:56.333
You're not a burden to me.

1230
01:42:58.166 --> 01:43:00.041
-I always have been.
-No.

1231
01:43:00.125 --> 01:43:01.166
-I was.
-No.

1232
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:03.625
I was a burden in your house, right?

1233
01:43:03.708 --> 01:43:05.041
-No.
-I was.

1234
01:43:05.125 --> 01:43:06.250
No.

1235
01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:08.833
I burdened you.

1236
01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:14.333
That's why I, Nina, Woko and Ano,
we all have to work.

1237
01:43:14.416 --> 01:43:17.916
We all work hard
so that we won't burden you anymore.

1238
01:43:22.375 --> 01:43:24.583
What do you mean, Ais?

1239
01:43:32.666 --> 01:43:34.958
Mo, calm down.

1240
01:43:35.041 --> 01:43:35.916
I can't, Rin.

1241
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:36.875
But you can't…

1242
01:43:36.958 --> 01:43:40.250
Hear me out first? Please!

1243
01:43:40.333 --> 01:43:42.000
-Eka is horrible, Rin.
-I know.

1244
01:43:42.083 --> 01:43:43.791
I can't just stay here.

1245
01:43:43.875 --> 01:43:46.875
Mo? Moko! Mo!

1246
01:43:46.958 --> 01:43:48.083
What, Rin?

1247
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:57.583
Just take my car.

1248
01:43:58.333 --> 01:43:59.458
I will catch you later.

1249
01:44:01.541 --> 01:44:03.833
How long will you wait for a travel van?

1250
01:44:05.666 --> 01:44:07.958
The kids need you, Mo. Just go.

1251
01:44:12.416 --> 01:44:13.625
Go!

1252
01:44:22.375 --> 01:44:25.708
Do you know where the others work?

1253
01:44:29.708 --> 01:44:32.166
Woko…

1254
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:35.833
he said he worked in a photocopy place.

1255
01:44:35.916 --> 01:44:37.583
But he's happy.

1256
01:44:38.375 --> 01:44:42.500
Because it was close to… Wait.
It's right next to the Trisakti campus.

1257
01:44:42.583 --> 01:44:44.916
That's his dream campus.

1258
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.458
So he said…

1259
01:44:46.541 --> 01:44:49.916
he can take a peek
at the students' assignments.

1260
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.458
He can learn from those.

1261
01:44:54.208 --> 01:44:55.791
As for Nina…

1262
01:44:56.666 --> 01:44:59.291
I didn't quite understand.

1263
01:44:59.375 --> 01:45:01.041
She said that she

1264
01:45:01.125 --> 01:45:04.916
worked at a restaurant
where she had to be mean.

1265
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.166
Something like that.
I don't really get the concept.

1266
01:45:10.041 --> 01:45:12.083
And Ano…

1267
01:45:13.416 --> 01:45:15.166
he's a construction worker now.

1268
01:45:15.250 --> 01:45:19.166
He said he could lose weight
while he was at it. I'm not sure.

1269
01:45:21.250 --> 01:45:22.916
It's actually dangerous.

1270
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:37.541
Hey, Mo? You didn't tell me
you're coming home.

1271
01:45:37.625 --> 01:45:38.833
Where is Eka?

1272
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:42.958
He's out of town for work.
What's the matter?

1273
01:45:43.041 --> 01:45:44.666
Why did he make them work?

1274
01:45:47.250 --> 01:45:48.375
Calm down, Mo.

1275
01:45:52.416 --> 01:45:55.416
Wasn't the money I sent you enough?

1276
01:45:55.958 --> 01:45:57.833
Mo, calm down.

1277
01:45:58.958 --> 01:46:00.833
Osa, please just answer.

1278
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.208
The money was enough.

1279
01:46:03.875 --> 01:46:06.125
But at the moment, Eka used the money

1280
01:46:06.208 --> 01:46:08.458
-for an investment--
-He used the money?

1281
01:46:09.250 --> 01:46:13.000
But the profit will be bigger.
You'll get it back. It's been proven.

1282
01:46:13.083 --> 01:46:14.250
Proven?

1283
01:46:14.333 --> 01:46:16.875
-The kids are working.
-Eka is great at investing.

1284
01:46:16.958 --> 01:46:20.625
-Osa, the kids are all working!
-You just need to be patient.

1285
01:46:22.083 --> 01:46:25.375
Have you ever heard
of something called binary options?

1286
01:46:26.625 --> 01:46:28.458
It involves billions of rupiah.

1287
01:46:28.541 --> 01:46:30.208
When the money grows,

1288
01:46:30.291 --> 01:46:34.083
not only the children,
even you can also stop working.

1289
01:46:38.791 --> 01:46:40.375
How long has Eka been gone?

1290
01:46:41.916 --> 01:46:43.333
About two months.

1291
01:46:48.958 --> 01:46:50.708
That's a fraudulent investment.

1292
01:46:52.083 --> 01:46:53.500
We won't get the money back.

1293
01:46:56.041 --> 01:46:57.750
How do you know it's a scam?

1294
01:46:58.958 --> 01:47:01.666
Mo? Moko?

1295
01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:05.791
Mo?

1296
01:47:22.625 --> 01:47:26.916
Hello, Ima. Hello.

1297
01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.583
I'm sorry I left you.

1298
01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:41.875
I'll go and get your siblings.
You'd love that?

1299
01:47:45.666 --> 01:47:46.791
You'd love that, huh?

1300
01:47:53.708 --> 01:47:55.041
Thank you, No.

1301
01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.333
-Is it good?
-Here, No.

1302
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.750
Excuse me.

1303
01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:11.125
Ano?

1304
01:48:17.625 --> 01:48:18.666
Moko?

1305
01:48:19.666 --> 01:48:20.875
Let's go home.

1306
01:48:23.333 --> 01:48:26.000
Give me a minute. I'm not finished yet.

1307
01:48:36.083 --> 01:48:39.041
Sir?

1308
01:48:39.125 --> 01:48:42.125
Can I borrow your tools to help my nephew?

1309
01:48:43.041 --> 01:48:45.708
-You want to help?
-Yes, I know how to do it.

1310
01:48:46.833 --> 01:48:48.583
-Return it soon.
-Okay.

1311
01:48:48.666 --> 01:48:49.666
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1312
01:48:58.041 --> 01:49:01.833
It was Eka, right?
He said you were a burden?

1313
01:49:10.666 --> 01:49:14.916
Do you remember when you were sick
and I cancelled my plan to buy a laptop?

1314
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:19.375
I was really grateful…

1315
01:49:23.083 --> 01:49:24.625
that you were okay.

1316
01:49:25.166 --> 01:49:29.458
But you almost didn't get the job
because of me.

1317
01:49:30.125 --> 01:49:32.208
Because you didn't buy the laptop.

1318
01:49:42.083 --> 01:49:43.958
That's right.

1319
01:49:44.041 --> 01:49:45.458
But I can find another job.

1320
01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.750
Money can be earned.

1321
01:49:52.083 --> 01:49:53.541
But the main thing for me…

1322
01:49:55.125 --> 01:49:56.583
is your health, No.

1323
01:49:58.875 --> 01:50:01.833
I work for you.

1324
01:50:09.625 --> 01:50:11.125
If something happens to you…

1325
01:50:14.833 --> 01:50:16.875
who will finish the rice at home?

1326
01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:32.541
Woko.

1327
01:50:39.041 --> 01:50:40.583
When did you get here?

1328
01:50:41.625 --> 01:50:42.708
Wo.

1329
01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:45.458
Don't listen to Eka, okay?

1330
01:50:46.083 --> 01:50:48.750
No way. Not anymore. He's insane.

1331
01:50:48.833 --> 01:50:51.791
-Woko…
-I never liked him from the start.

1332
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:54.458
He speaks nonsense.

1333
01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.166
He said, nothing is free in this life,
that's why we have to work.

1334
01:51:00.208 --> 01:51:01.916
I feel so bad for the kids.

1335
01:51:07.416 --> 01:51:10.250
A construction worker, right?
Great. In construction.

1336
01:51:10.333 --> 01:51:12.125
He doesn't listen. He's impossible.

1337
01:51:13.208 --> 01:51:15.708
Okay, then. Where's Nina, Wo?

1338
01:51:16.958 --> 01:51:21.833
That girl. She's also hard to deal with.
She should focus on college.

1339
01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:31.708
I'm sorry.

1340
01:51:34.375 --> 01:51:35.416
Thank you, Wo.

1341
01:51:39.875 --> 01:51:42.375
Come on! Let's get Nina.

1342
01:51:45.125 --> 01:51:46.333
I'll clean up here first.

1343
01:51:50.625 --> 01:51:52.500
Why are you smiling?

1344
01:51:52.583 --> 01:51:54.083
-Just a moment.
-Okay.

1345
01:51:54.916 --> 01:51:57.583
You better look for another place to work.

1346
01:51:57.666 --> 01:52:00.250
-But, sir--
-You've been here for a month.

1347
01:52:00.333 --> 01:52:02.500
I don't think this job
is suitable for you.

1348
01:52:06.666 --> 01:52:08.416
I can do it. I'll try again.

1349
01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.208
That's not how it works, Nina.

1350
01:52:11.458 --> 01:52:14.458
How about this.
We have customers there. Serve them.

1351
01:52:14.583 --> 01:52:17.875
We'll see what you can do.
I'm not sure you can, though.

1352
01:52:17.958 --> 01:52:20.708
-I will try. I know I can.
-What are you waiting for?

1353
01:52:34.875 --> 01:52:35.916
Hi.

1354
01:52:38.166 --> 01:52:39.208
Na, let's go home.

1355
01:52:48.250 --> 01:52:49.708
Read it, tell me your orders!

1356
01:52:52.791 --> 01:52:55.541
I can tell by your look,
you don't have money.

1357
01:52:55.625 --> 01:52:57.916
Don't let me see you order
one meal to share!

1358
01:52:58.916 --> 01:53:01.583
That's how she's supposed to serve.
With anger.

1359
01:53:02.666 --> 01:53:04.375
Do your job well!

1360
01:53:04.458 --> 01:53:06.500
She yells. We chill.

1361
01:53:08.333 --> 01:53:09.375
Na.

1362
01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:11.416
Stop working.

1363
01:53:12.458 --> 01:53:14.333
Don't listen to Eka.

1364
01:53:15.083 --> 01:53:19.333
You've never been a burden to me.

1365
01:53:19.416 --> 01:53:21.625
-The others--
-You all are giving me trouble!

1366
01:53:21.708 --> 01:53:23.916
What's taking you so long? Can't you read?

1367
01:53:27.250 --> 01:53:29.916
Don't order.
Your brother is paying, right?

1368
01:53:30.583 --> 01:53:31.833
Can't you see his face?

1369
01:53:32.541 --> 01:53:36.083
He's young, he has hopes,
he has a future ahead of him.

1370
01:53:36.166 --> 01:53:40.333
Instead, you behave like leeches
and suffocate him. Don't you get it?

1371
01:53:44.375 --> 01:53:46.083
And you, you're an idiot, Moko!

1372
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.166
Why let your family leech off you?

1373
01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:56.625
You should go, Moko!
Leave, work, live your own life!

1374
01:53:56.708 --> 01:54:00.208
We are responsible for our own lives.
Why worry about others?

1375
01:54:00.291 --> 01:54:01.333
And for what?

1376
01:54:06.416 --> 01:54:07.916
Are you trying to be a hero?

1377
01:54:11.166 --> 01:54:12.291
Nina…

1378
01:54:13.333 --> 01:54:14.291
I…

1379
01:54:17.625 --> 01:54:20.083
I don't want to be a burden
anymore. I'm sick of it!

1380
01:54:20.166 --> 01:54:21.625
I can survive by myself!

1381
01:54:21.708 --> 01:54:23.958
-Nina!
-Na!

1382
01:54:24.833 --> 01:54:27.291
-Na!
-Na! Nina!

1383
01:54:32.166 --> 01:54:33.458
Nina!

1384
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:35.208
Nina!

1385
01:54:38.708 --> 01:54:39.875
Nina!

1386
01:54:45.833 --> 01:54:47.166
Eka ran away, Na.

1387
01:54:49.416 --> 01:54:51.458
Eka ran away with all the money!

1388
01:54:54.208 --> 01:54:57.541
He said all those things
so he can run off with the money!

1389
01:55:00.458 --> 01:55:01.458
Na!

1390
01:55:05.208 --> 01:55:06.833
Eka ran away.

1391
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.958
He had all of you working…

1392
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:21.416
so that he could escape with the money.

1393
01:55:26.666 --> 01:55:30.208
None of you are my burden.
You're not a burden.

1394
01:55:32.833 --> 01:55:33.958
Nina.

1395
01:55:42.833 --> 01:55:44.166
Let's go home.

1396
01:56:06.958 --> 01:56:08.000
Nina.

1397
01:56:10.166 --> 01:56:11.708
Ano, Woko.

1398
01:56:14.166 --> 01:56:15.208
Stop working, okay?

1399
01:56:19.791 --> 01:56:22.250
What's wrong? I've explained it to you.

1400
01:56:22.958 --> 01:56:26.166
Even if Eka didn't take the money,
we still burdened you.

1401
01:56:27.958 --> 01:56:29.125
No, Nina.

1402
01:56:29.708 --> 01:56:30.833
We are.

1403
01:56:30.916 --> 01:56:32.541
No, we're family.

1404
01:56:34.208 --> 01:56:35.916
Mo, I want to say something to you.

1405
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.291
Me too.

1406
01:56:38.625 --> 01:56:39.791
You have done so much.

1407
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.666
Hang on, Wo. What is it now?

1408
01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:44.500
You supported me earlier.

1409
01:56:44.583 --> 01:56:45.916
I did.

1410
01:56:47.083 --> 01:56:50.083
-But Nina has a point.
-How?

1411
01:56:50.166 --> 01:56:53.500
Nina is right.
If you used the money to buy a laptop…

1412
01:56:53.583 --> 01:56:55.125
This would never happened.

1413
01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:56.958
Hang on. One at a time.

1414
01:56:57.041 --> 01:56:59.041
I agree, the children are a burden, Mo.

1415
01:56:59.125 --> 01:57:00.541
Why are you saying that, Rin?

1416
01:57:00.625 --> 01:57:01.833
It is true, Mo.

1417
01:57:01.916 --> 01:57:03.041
-No, Rin. What--
-No…

1418
01:57:03.125 --> 01:57:06.250
-I never see them as a burden.
-Don't be naive.

1419
01:57:06.333 --> 01:57:08.958
That's just Eka talking.
It's a lie and I don't agree.

1420
01:57:09.041 --> 01:57:12.541
-What he's thinking--
-Listen. I'm trying to explain.

1421
01:57:12.625 --> 01:57:14.458
-What is this?
-Moko.

1422
01:57:20.666 --> 01:57:22.083
How about this?

1423
01:57:22.166 --> 01:57:25.083
So everyone can speak,
raise your hand if you want to speak.

1424
01:57:25.625 --> 01:57:28.541
Okay? We'll listen to whoever is talking
until they're done.

1425
01:57:28.625 --> 01:57:29.666
What?

1426
01:57:30.208 --> 01:57:33.125
So, Moko picked me up
at the construction site.

1427
01:57:33.708 --> 01:57:38.625
He told me
that we have never been a burden to him.

1428
01:57:39.708 --> 01:57:41.458
Deep down inside…

1429
01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:46.125
Moko truly wants to care for all of us.

1430
01:57:48.125 --> 01:57:50.666
Moko has been like a father figure to me.

1431
01:57:52.041 --> 01:57:53.791
So you don' think you're a burden?

1432
01:57:53.875 --> 01:57:54.958
No.

1433
01:57:55.041 --> 01:57:57.458
-You want to stop working?
-I still do, though.

1434
01:58:00.416 --> 01:58:01.666
What?

1435
01:58:05.375 --> 01:58:07.666
Let's say that Eka said that to us

1436
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:10.000
so he could take the money
you sent for us.

1437
01:58:10.083 --> 01:58:11.583
Mind your words!

1438
01:58:13.458 --> 01:58:14.583
That's the reality.

1439
01:58:16.166 --> 01:58:20.583
It's an investment, it takes time.
Do you understand?

1440
01:58:22.916 --> 01:58:24.916
Can you give that excuse to my school?

1441
01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.541
Use that investment excuse
to Ano's school?

1442
01:58:29.083 --> 01:58:30.208
You can't, can you?

1443
01:58:30.291 --> 01:58:33.000
Because the money is gone
and we can't get it back.

1444
01:58:33.083 --> 01:58:34.500
That's enough.

1445
01:58:34.583 --> 01:58:37.541
Osa, if you want to join
the conversation, come here.

1446
01:58:49.666 --> 01:58:50.833
Okay. Go on.

1447
01:58:53.375 --> 01:58:56.208
All right, let's say
Eka didn't touch the money.

1448
01:58:56.291 --> 01:59:01.041
But the fact that Moko worked
tirelessly for us, day and night,

1449
01:59:01.125 --> 01:59:02.166
that's still true.

1450
01:59:03.666 --> 01:59:06.041
The fact is we are a burden. A hassle!

1451
01:59:06.125 --> 01:59:07.083
Nina!

1452
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:10.791
Not a burden.

1453
01:59:11.541 --> 01:59:13.750
What family doesn't cause trouble?

1454
01:59:16.666 --> 01:59:18.083
Fine, say you're a hassle.

1455
01:59:20.041 --> 01:59:21.875
But have I never hassled you?

1456
01:59:21.958 --> 01:59:23.083
Never!

1457
01:59:24.791 --> 01:59:28.375
I took your sandals once
when you were about to use them.

1458
01:59:28.458 --> 01:59:30.333
-That's one.
-No, I have other sandals.

1459
01:59:31.666 --> 01:59:32.708
Woko.

1460
01:59:33.916 --> 01:59:36.625
You had to put off college
to take care of Ima

1461
01:59:36.708 --> 01:59:39.291
when I started working.
That must have been a hassle.

1462
01:59:39.875 --> 01:59:42.083
It's fun to play with Ima,
it's not a hassle.

1463
01:59:44.333 --> 01:59:45.333
Nina.

1464
01:59:46.583 --> 01:59:50.041
You cook for everyone
in this house everyday.

1465
01:59:50.625 --> 01:59:51.666
A hassle, right?

1466
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:57.791
We never felt burdened by you
because you are so kind to us.

1467
02:00:02.625 --> 02:00:03.666
That's the thing.

1468
02:00:06.625 --> 02:00:09.875
You don't think
you've all been kind to me as well?

1469
02:00:11.416 --> 02:00:12.958
That you love me?

1470
02:00:17.208 --> 02:00:19.041
We're family.

1471
02:00:19.125 --> 02:00:22.833
There's no such thing
as being troublesome or a burden.

1472
02:00:24.125 --> 02:00:25.916
All of you, quit your jobs.

1473
02:00:26.625 --> 02:00:28.625
I work morning, noon, night.

1474
02:00:29.291 --> 02:00:32.416
Not once did I think about
asking you to repay me.

1475
02:00:36.250 --> 02:00:38.708
What kind of grownups will you become…

1476
02:00:40.416 --> 02:00:42.875
if you believe you owe something
to your family?

1477
02:00:56.083 --> 02:00:57.125
Okay.

1478
02:00:57.875 --> 02:01:01.791
I agree with Moko.
No one here is a burden.

1479
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.375
But I don't believe
the kids should not be allowed to work.

1480
02:01:07.458 --> 02:01:09.958
What's this?
Why are you encouraging them to work?

1481
02:01:10.041 --> 02:01:12.541
Except for the construction job.
You hear me, Ano?

1482
02:01:13.291 --> 02:01:14.958
You're too young, it's dangerous.

1483
02:01:15.041 --> 02:01:17.500
-Okay.
-Find another job, okay?

1484
02:01:18.875 --> 02:01:19.916
Okay.

1485
02:01:21.916 --> 02:01:25.375
It's okay, Mo. It's okay for them to work.

1486
02:01:25.458 --> 02:01:27.250
Not because they feel indebted.

1487
02:01:28.916 --> 02:01:31.708
-Rin, you don't understand--
-What, Mo?

1488
02:01:31.791 --> 02:01:32.916
Want to break up again?

1489
02:01:34.458 --> 02:01:35.500
You can't, can you?

1490
02:01:36.708 --> 02:01:38.000
We're not even dating.

1491
02:01:45.625 --> 02:01:47.166
How long will this go on, Mo?

1492
02:01:47.250 --> 02:01:50.208
How long will you stop me
from standing up for you?

1493
02:01:53.666 --> 02:01:55.416
I want to live with you, Mo.

1494
02:01:57.500 --> 02:01:58.750
The kids want it too.

1495
02:02:01.375 --> 02:02:04.125
We're all here to support each other,
can we do that?

1496
02:02:30.333 --> 02:02:31.541
Okay.

1497
02:02:53.791 --> 02:02:54.750
Mo?

1498
02:02:57.625 --> 02:02:58.666
Mo?

1499
02:02:59.458 --> 02:03:00.458
Hey.

1500
02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:06.750
We will do this together.

1501
02:03:24.958 --> 02:03:26.125
Can I join you?

1502
02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:29.208
You're sticky.

1503
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.375
Let it be.

1504
02:03:52.291 --> 02:03:53.583
Would you like that?

1505
02:04:11.541 --> 02:04:13.166
But have you ever done that?

1506
02:04:14.666 --> 02:04:19.666
Doing something…

1507
02:04:20.291 --> 02:04:22.708
just to feel
that the person is still here?

1508
02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.583
What's the personal reason
you chose the open concept?

1509
02:04:42.666 --> 02:04:44.583
I don't want the academic explanation.

1510
02:04:44.666 --> 02:04:47.750
But I want to hear
the personal reason, from the heart.

1511
02:04:52.166 --> 02:04:54.333
Come on in.

1512
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:58.500
-Need any help?
-I'm fine.

1513
02:05:27.041 --> 02:05:29.916
By knocking down the wall…

1514
02:05:31.250 --> 02:05:33.708
we'll have a more spacious area

1515
02:05:34.791 --> 02:05:36.958
for everyone to gather.

1516
02:05:57.083 --> 02:05:58.500
I'm home.

1517
02:06:08.291 --> 02:06:10.416
-Ais?
-Ais?

1518
02:06:16.416 --> 02:06:17.958
Any news from Eka?

1519
02:06:29.208 --> 02:06:30.541
I'm sorry.

1520
02:06:31.875 --> 02:06:34.333
Don't worry about it.

1521
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.875
I'm sorry.

1522
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.291
Osa?

1523
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:52.958
What's wrong?

1524
02:06:53.041 --> 02:06:56.125
Nothing. Your hair looks nice.

1525
02:06:59.291 --> 02:07:00.208
Really?

1526
02:07:02.958 --> 02:07:04.416
Let's eat together.

1527
02:07:09.916 --> 02:07:12.250
Now your hair looks similar to mine.

1528
02:08:34.833 --> 02:08:37.708
NO BABIES WERE HARMED
DURING THE MAKING OF THIS FILM
