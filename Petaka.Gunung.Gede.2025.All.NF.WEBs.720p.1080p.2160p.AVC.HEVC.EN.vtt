1
00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.416
I'm Maya Azka.

2
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.875
I'm not finished telling my story.

3
00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:20.333
Awful. Why do my bangs look like that?

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.291
Your face is the problem, not the photo.

5
00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:25.875
Shut it. Let's do it again!

6
00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:29.750
Hurry up.

7
00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.458
Let's coordinate our pose.

8
00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:33.000
- Hurry!
- What pose?

9
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:41.958
Ita, look, it's so ugly. My bangs!

10
00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.583
I look terrible in the photo as well.

11
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.583
Stop being so dramatic.

12
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.875
Ita!

13
00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.041
Give it back!

14
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:53.958
Ita!

15
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:56.041
BASED ON A TRUE STORY
BY MAYA AZKA

16
00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.458
I'll go faster!

17
00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:05.666
Stop!

18
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.041
Stop that.

19
00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:08.583
Five, six, seven, eight!

20
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.416
- Take that!
- Arms in the air!

21
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.958
No!

22
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.333
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

23
00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:31.625
Let's go!

24
00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.583
He's so cute! Okay.

25
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.958
One, two, three, go!

26
00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:01.291
You're crazy!

27
00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:18.708
Hey.

28
00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:21.375
School starts again soon.

29
00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:25.791
How should we make the most
of what's left of our break?

30
00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:28.250
I'm getting bored.

31
00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:30.041
Yeah.

32
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:32.208
We should go somewhere.

33
00:02:34.416 --> 00:02:35.625
How about Bandung?

34
00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:38.083
We can stay at my relative's house.

35
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.375
Let's not go too far.

36
00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:46.208
You know my dad won't allow it.

37
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.750
You're all grown up.
Your dad still won't let you go?

38
00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:52.833
I don't get it.

39
00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:57.125
I've grown up now,
but he's still protective.

40
00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:00.083
I'll always be a kid in his eyes.

41
00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:05.375
He's overprotective
because he loves you so much.

42
00:03:07.916 --> 00:03:08.875
What's wrong?

43
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:12.250
Nothing.

44
00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:16.291
Ita. I'm going home.

45
00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:18.416
You're leaving already?

46
00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:25.333
Do you need to pee?

47
00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:27.041
I'll take you.

48
00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:29.250
I can do it at home.

49
00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:32.500
Why don't you ever use
the bathroom at my place?

50
00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:35.250
Did you see something?

51
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.916
Liar.

52
00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:43.291
See you, Ita. I'm going back.

53
00:04:08.708 --> 00:04:13.000
Maya, if you're planning to go
somewhere, you'd better take me with you.

54
00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:15.333
Don't you dare leave me out.

55
00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:17.458
Who else would you go with anyway?

56
00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:18.791
I'm your only friend.

57
00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.791
Hey! Were you listening?

58
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.583
Be honest with me.

59
00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:38.625
What can you see?

60
00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:40.250
Is it scary?

61
00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.583
There's nothing there.

62
00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:43.458
Ita.

63
00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:45.666
Ita.

64
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:03.083
Oh my God. Mom!

65
00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:04.416
I thought you were a ghost.

66
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.791
Do I look like one to you?

67
00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:08.875
Don't be ridiculous.

68
00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.083
Maya, this is for your mom.

69
00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:14.541
I made Soto Madura, your mom's favorite.

70
00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:17.416
Say hi to your mom for me,
and tell her I'll come by.

71
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:19.625
I'll let her know.

72
00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:21.291
- I'm heading out.
- Okay.

73
00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:23.208
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you peace.

74
00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:26.125
- Bye!
- Bye!

75
00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:30.333
- Maya.
- Hello, sir.

76
00:05:30.416 --> 00:05:31.666
- You're going home already?
- Yes.

77
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.166
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you peace. Take care.

78
00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:37.041
Dad!

79
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:38.083
Hello, dear.

80
00:05:39.458 --> 00:05:41.208
Where's your mom?

81
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:42.416
She's inside.

82
00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:55.000
Maya, take this to your brother's friends.

83
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.250
- Okay, Mom.
- Be careful.

84
00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:58.250
Okay.

85
00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:02.958
Maya. Take these fritters too.

86
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.083
Are we really going to Mount Gede?

87
00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:11.666
You're usually just all talk.

88
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.708
- Of course we're going.
- Let's do it.

89
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:16.666
- It's been a while since we hiked.
- We must make it happen.

90
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.541
- Coffee.
- Yes.

91
00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:20.083
Fritters.

92
00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:21.041
Thanks, Maya.

93
00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:23.500
- Thank you, Maya.
- You're welcome.

94
00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.708
Are we taking the Putri
or the Cibodas route?

95
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:28.916
How about Cibodas?
We can go with my relatives.

96
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.250
Sounds good.

97
00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:31.916
Are we getting a ride to the base camp?

98
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.500
No, just to the Cibodas intersection.

99
00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:37.416
He's delivering vegetables to Bogor.

100
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.833
Why not go straight to the base camp?

101
00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:42.791
- Ucup, you ungrateful dumbass.
- What?

102
00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:46.000
It's good that
we're getting a lift even that far.

103
00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:49.166
- Don't ask for more.
- I was just asking.

104
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.458
- You're being ungrateful.
- It was a question.

105
00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:52.708
Use your head for once.

106
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:54.750
- Don't blame me.
- Can I come?

107
00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:56.041
No, no.

108
00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:58.250
- What?
- She's asking if she can come.

109
00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.083
Why not?

110
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:04.041
Maya, you've never hiked
a mountain before.

111
00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:06.833
So why not do it while I'm still on break?

112
00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:08.625
I swear I won't be a burden.

113
00:07:08.708 --> 00:07:12.125
Hiking isn't the same
as going to the mall.

114
00:07:12.208 --> 00:07:15.750
You need physical and mental preparation

115
00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:17.083
as well as special equipment.

116
00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:18.833
- You don't have any.
- I can buy it.

117
00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:20.250
No, I won't allow it.

118
00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:22.333
Mountains can be creepy.

119
00:07:22.416 --> 00:07:23.333
Right.

120
00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:26.000
What if you see something
and mention it to us?

121
00:07:26.083 --> 00:07:27.916
I'll be freaked out.

122
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.208
I won't. I swear I won't mention anything.

123
00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.083
I promise.

124
00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:34.291
Okay?

125
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.916
Can I?

126
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.625
Can I?

127
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:42.583
- Please?
- All right, fine.

128
00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:43.541
Yes!

129
00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:45.250
But talk to Mom first.

130
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:46.708
Hey!

131
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:48.208
- Get Mom's permission!
- I got it.

132
00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:52.000
What?

133
00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:53.916
Your parents allowed you to go hiking?

134
00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:55.750
Yeah, they did.

135
00:07:55.833 --> 00:07:59.041
I'll be going with my brother
so they know I'll be safe.

136
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.541
Come on, Ita.

137
00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:04.500
<i>How often do you get to go hiking
while we're on our break?</i>

138
00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:05.583
I know.

139
00:08:06.083 --> 00:08:07.166
Sounds like so much fun.

140
00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:11.625
I wish I could go,
but how do I bring it up?

141
00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:14.833
I'm sure they won't let me go.

142
00:08:15.666 --> 00:08:18.000
<i>You should try.</i>

143
00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:20.083
<i>Your parents trust me, right?</i>

144
00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:25.333
<i>Please, Ita.
I don't want to be the only girl.</i>

145
00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:32.333
<i>Ita?</i>

146
00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:35.666
<i>Ita.</i>

147
00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:42.416
<i>Ita.</i>

148
00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:45.250
Okay.

149
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:48.625
But can you talk to my mom about it?

150
00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:55.333
Don't worry, ma'am.
Indra will be there to watch over us.

151
00:08:55.416 --> 00:08:57.875
He's used to hiking with his friends.

152
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.000
Are you sure about this, Ita?

153
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.958
Yes, Mom.

154
00:09:04.791 --> 00:09:07.000
Do you even have the equipment?

155
00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:10.333
I'll borrow some from Ima,
Aunt Sumi's daughter.

156
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.500
She likes going hiking as well.

157
00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:18.583
I don't think your dad will allow it, Ita.

158
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.166
What's up?

159
00:09:25.916 --> 00:09:27.291
Dear.

160
00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:31.166
Ita asked if she could go
to Mount Gede with Maya...

161
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.083
Huh?

162
00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:33.791
...and Maya's brother.

163
00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:36.958
He's used to going hiking

164
00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:40.250
so he can watch over them.

165
00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:42.708
No.

166
00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:54.708
Please, Dad.

167
00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:07.833
What I meant to say is, "No problem."

168
00:10:07.916 --> 00:10:10.250
Really?

169
00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:11.916
- I can go hiking?
- Yes.

170
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.666
Thanks, Dad!

171
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.791
- Okay, okay.
- I can go, Maya.

172
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.791
Thank you, Dad!

173
00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:21.083
But be careful, okay?

174
00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:22.750
- I will be.
- All right.

175
00:10:24.083 --> 00:10:25.291
Yay!

176
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.833
Ita, remember.

177
00:10:32.916 --> 00:10:35.666
My brother says we need to exercise.

178
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:40.291
We need to make sure we're physically fit
so our muscles don't get stiff when...

179
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.791
What's up?

180
00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:54.416
Ita, I have to go.

181
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.666
Maya!

182
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.958
What are you doing?

183
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:36.125
Dad, are you a ninja,
sneaking up on people like that?

184
00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:38.166
A ninja, you say?

185
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.750
- Ninja!
- Dad!

186
00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:44.250
How could you accuse your dad
of sneaking around like a ninja?

187
00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.000
- Mom.
- Hey, ready to go?

188
00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:56.833
ONE WEEK LATER

189
00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.125
Did you pack everything?

190
00:11:58.208 --> 00:11:59.250
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

191
00:11:59.333 --> 00:12:03.416
Take care. Watch how you act and speak.

192
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.208
If you're tired, tell your brother.
Don't push yourself.

193
00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:09.208
- I got it, Dad.
- I'm serious.

194
00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:11.333
- Mom.
- Take care of your little sister.

195
00:12:11.416 --> 00:12:12.958
- I will, Mom.
- Okay?

196
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.208
Let's go.

197
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:15.875
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you.

198
00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.333
- And upon you peace.
- And upon you peace.

199
00:12:19.916 --> 00:12:22.208
Ita is still getting ready. Please wait.

200
00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:23.541
- Okay.
- Okay.

201
00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:25.666
Maya, please keep an eye on Ita.

202
00:12:26.666 --> 00:12:28.916
And make sure she eats.

203
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.333
Yes, I'll remind her.

204
00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.000
Indra.

205
00:12:33.916 --> 00:12:35.125
Please take care of Ita.

206
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.750
She's never hiked before.

207
00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:41.250
Please be patient with her
on the mountain.

208
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.666
My friends and I will take care of her.

209
00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:47.000
- We're heading out.
- Okay.

210
00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:49.666
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you peace.

211
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.708
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you peace.

212
00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:53.208
Maya!

213
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.833
Hello, sir.

214
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.375
Yay!

215
00:12:57.458 --> 00:13:00.000
- We're going to the mountains!
- We're going to the mountains!

216
00:13:00.083 --> 00:13:00.875
Let's go.

217
00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:02.708
The others are waiting.

218
00:13:03.125 --> 00:13:04.166
Mom.

219
00:13:04.791 --> 00:13:06.125
- Bye, Mom.
- Take care.

220
00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:07.041
Yeah.

221
00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:08.041
- Maya.
- Auntie.

222
00:13:57.875 --> 00:13:58.750
Guys, let's go.

223
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:02.375
Come on.

224
00:14:05.208 --> 00:14:07.500
Thanks, sir. Take care.

225
00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:10.875
Bike taxi?

226
00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.500
Yeah. But there are seven of us.

227
00:14:13.583 --> 00:14:14.750
Only three bikes?

228
00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:18.000
Yes, the others haven't come yet.

229
00:14:18.083 --> 00:14:19.666
- Oh no.
- How about

230
00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:23.458
- you ask the minibus driver?
- Over there.

231
00:14:23.541 --> 00:14:25.916
He's often hired for mountain trips.

232
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.500
Okay, thanks.

233
00:14:27.583 --> 00:14:28.458
No worries.

234
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:30.000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

235
00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:31.666
- Where to next?
- Hey, where we should go?

236
00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:34.666
Be careful while crossing the road.

237
00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:36.625
Watch out.

238
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.583
Maya.

239
00:14:50.708 --> 00:14:52.166
You promised me, Maya.

240
00:14:52.916 --> 00:14:55.750
If you see something, keep it to yourself.

241
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:21.416
Thanks, sir.

242
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.458
Let's go.

243
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:25.208
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

244
00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:28.958
Let's go.

245
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.416
Maya, you go ahead.

246
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.625
Okay.

247
00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:38.541
- Careful, Ita.
- Okay.

248
00:15:40.375 --> 00:15:41.583
Watch out.

249
00:15:41.666 --> 00:15:42.375
Here you go.

250
00:15:42.458 --> 00:15:43.625
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

251
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:45.458
Thanks, sir.

252
00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:46.666
You're welcome.

253
00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:50.708
Ita?

254
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.583
What's wrong?

255
00:15:53.666 --> 00:15:54.791
Just a stomachache.

256
00:15:56.291 --> 00:15:57.333
But I'm okay.

257
00:15:57.416 --> 00:15:58.416
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

258
00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.666
Let's go.

259
00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.083
Only one night?

260
00:16:11.833 --> 00:16:13.833
Yeah. We're going up in the morning.

261
00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:21.208
- Here it is.
- Okay.

262
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:22.708
- Thank you.
- Wait, that's too much.

263
00:16:23.291 --> 00:16:24.416
But it's seven people.

264
00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:26.000
The price went up.

265
00:16:26.916 --> 00:16:28.083
Oh.

266
00:16:28.166 --> 00:16:29.500
- Thanks, miss.
- Sure.

267
00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:31.333
Come in.

268
00:16:31.416 --> 00:16:32.333
Hey.

269
00:16:35.708 --> 00:16:37.666
We'll rest for now.

270
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.083
We leave at seven in the morning tomorrow.

271
00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:40.250
Okay.

272
00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.000
- Come on.
- Come on. Okay.

273
00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:44.041
- Excuse us, miss.
- Right.

274
00:16:44.125 --> 00:16:45.541
The pillows are out the back.

275
00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:46.583
- Got it.
- Got it.

276
00:17:08.291 --> 00:17:09.125
Maya.

277
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.041
Maya.

278
00:17:18.458 --> 00:17:19.583
What is it?

279
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.958
I think I got my period.

280
00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:31.208
Are you serious?

281
00:17:37.208 --> 00:17:40.541
Then let's just
go back home tomorrow, Ita.

282
00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:42.458
No, Maya.

283
00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:45.291
We've already come all the way here.

284
00:17:45.375 --> 00:17:48.666
But it's taboo to hike
while you're on your period.

285
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.250
No.

286
00:17:52.083 --> 00:17:53.708
We can't turn back now.

287
00:17:55.625 --> 00:17:59.041
When else will we get the chance
to hike together like this?

288
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.208
Okay? Go back to sleep.

289
00:18:06.375 --> 00:18:07.708
I'll go change my panties.

290
00:18:09.333 --> 00:18:10.333
Do you bring pads?

291
00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:12.625
Yeah. Just in case.

292
00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:27.541
Ita!

293
00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:33.916
Ita!

294
00:19:34.416 --> 00:19:36.083
Ita!

295
00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:37.333
Open the door!

296
00:19:38.166 --> 00:19:39.958
Ita, open the door!

297
00:19:40.458 --> 00:19:41.791
What's going on?

298
00:19:47.666 --> 00:19:48.708
Ita.

299
00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:50.208
Ita?

300
00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:54.625
Ita.

301
00:19:55.833 --> 00:19:56.875
Ita, what happened?

302
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:04.958
Miss.

303
00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:07.166
Here. Drink this.

304
00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.583
It'll warm you up.

305
00:20:10.666 --> 00:20:13.291
Drink, Ita. Careful, it's hot.

306
00:20:13.916 --> 00:20:15.083
Take it slow.

307
00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:19.708
Gosh.

308
00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:32.416
I'm scared, Maya.

309
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:36.791
Scared of what?

310
00:20:38.916 --> 00:20:43.500
In the bathroom earlier,
I saw a dark figure.

311
00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:47.625
Tall...

312
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.583
huge...

313
00:20:52.583 --> 00:20:54.666
with red eyes.

314
00:20:58.375 --> 00:20:59.708
It was terrifying.

315
00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:02.333
Oh my God.

316
00:21:04.708 --> 00:21:07.416
That's the thing that resides in this place.

317
00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:11.208
It used to disturb the hikers here,

318
00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:17.208
but it never appeared again
after this place was cleansed.

319
00:21:18.291 --> 00:21:19.708
Why did it come back?

320
00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:22.666
I have no clue.

321
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.625
Maya.

322
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.541
Indra.

323
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:32.958
Are you okay?

324
00:21:40.916 --> 00:21:42.875
Seeing her condition...

325
00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:48.125
you two should take her home tomorrow.

326
00:21:48.208 --> 00:21:49.916
Don't go hiking.

327
00:21:53.208 --> 00:21:54.250
Okay?

328
00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.416
We're still going up tomorrow, right?

329
00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:20.291
I'm really looking forward to it.

330
00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:36.041
MOUNT GEDE HIKING TRAILS

331
00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:37.500
What about Ita?

332
00:22:38.833 --> 00:22:40.166
Is she coming?

333
00:22:45.708 --> 00:22:47.083
She's coming.

334
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.041
You know her condition.

335
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:58.000
She's on her period.
Why did you let her come?

336
00:22:59.583 --> 00:23:00.833
Take it easy.

337
00:23:05.625 --> 00:23:06.583
Akri.

338
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.916
You know that taboo is just superstition.

339
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.500
Her period is not the problem.

340
00:23:13.583 --> 00:23:15.833
The problem is her physical strength.

341
00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:20.458
If she's fit, it shouldn't be a problem.

342
00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:22.541
Morning.

343
00:23:29.791 --> 00:23:30.625
BASE CAMP STALL

344
00:23:30.708 --> 00:23:31.750
Let's go.

345
00:23:44.416 --> 00:23:45.500
It's sunny.

346
00:23:55.291 --> 00:23:56.875
The view is incredible.

347
00:23:58.375 --> 00:24:01.666
I should've brought my dad's camera
to capture the moment.

348
00:24:02.375 --> 00:24:04.208
We can capture it in our hearts.

349
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.083
- What's with that?
- Shh!

350
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:10.541
Sorry.

351
00:24:16.875 --> 00:24:18.291
- Thank you.
- Thanks, miss.

352
00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:19.958
Excuse me.

353
00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:40.916
Hey.

354
00:24:41.791 --> 00:24:46.166
Are you all seeing
the lady selling food over there?

355
00:24:50.583 --> 00:24:51.500
Yeah.

356
00:24:53.083 --> 00:24:54.458
Yeah. Why?

357
00:24:57.208 --> 00:24:58.125
No reason.

358
00:24:59.125 --> 00:25:01.833
That's going too far, Maya.

359
00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:06.041
Not every old woman you see
in this forest is a ghost.

360
00:25:06.125 --> 00:25:07.958
Right?

361
00:25:08.041 --> 00:25:10.416
- She looks so drawn.
- That's not right.

362
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.583
Someone looking ill
doesn't mean they're a ghost.

363
00:25:12.666 --> 00:25:13.375
Right.

364
00:25:13.458 --> 00:25:15.333
It might just be low blood pressure.

365
00:25:15.416 --> 00:25:16.958
Hey, shh.

366
00:25:17.541 --> 00:25:19.166
No more joking around here.

367
00:25:21.041 --> 00:25:23.041
COUNTER

368
00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:28.250
Let's pray before we start.

369
00:25:35.375 --> 00:25:38.916
<i>May our journey be smooth
until we reach our destination,</i>

370
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.083
<i>and may we return home safely</i>

371
00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:46.500
in one piece.

372
00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:48.291
Amen.

373
00:26:33.166 --> 00:26:34.000
Dear.

374
00:26:36.083 --> 00:26:37.125
Are you okay?

375
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.708
I have a bad feeling.

376
00:26:42.625 --> 00:26:45.458
You usually don't allow Ita
to travel very far.

377
00:26:46.875 --> 00:26:49.291
Why let her go now?

378
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.958
Ita is all grown up now.

379
00:26:55.041 --> 00:26:57.250
It's not good to smother her.

380
00:26:59.083 --> 00:27:00.208
Dear,

381
00:27:00.291 --> 00:27:03.208
she knows how to take care of herself.

382
00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:17.875
I found this in Ita's room,
in the trash can.

383
00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:22.125
I have a bad feeling.

384
00:27:22.208 --> 00:27:25.083
I think something's wrong with Ita.

385
00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:29.791
It could just be a common nosebleed.

386
00:27:31.208 --> 00:27:33.583
Don't make a big deal out of it.

387
00:27:34.875 --> 00:27:37.041
Ita is perfectly healthy.

388
00:27:39.208 --> 00:27:40.750
I'm off. Peace be upon you.

389
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.333
And upon you peace.

390
00:27:55.833 --> 00:27:56.916
Ita?

391
00:28:04.541 --> 00:28:08.208
Ita, if you're tired, we can take a break.

392
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.500
Ita.

393
00:28:13.583 --> 00:28:15.166
Are you spacing out?

394
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.500
Ita?

395
00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:17.666
Hey.

396
00:28:18.458 --> 00:28:20.166
Ita, don't space out.

397
00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:22.416
Ita!

398
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.583
Ita!

399
00:28:24.666 --> 00:28:25.666
Ita!

400
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.291
Ita!

401
00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:29.583
Ita!

402
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.833
Ita.

403
00:28:38.833 --> 00:28:40.166
Don't zone out on the mountain.

404
00:28:40.958 --> 00:28:42.125
Right.

405
00:28:42.208 --> 00:28:44.250
- Let's keep going.
- Let's go.

406
00:28:56.875 --> 00:28:58.000
Let's go.

407
00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:01.208
Ucup.

408
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.958
- Does anyone want some water?
- I don't.

409
00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:07.250
Don't eat too much.
We have a long way to go.

410
00:29:07.333 --> 00:29:08.166
Okay.

411
00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:11.916
Water?

412
00:29:13.375 --> 00:29:14.208
Look.

413
00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:18.458
She's going to the lake
even though we told her it's forbidden.

414
00:29:24.708 --> 00:29:26.625
Maya. What's Ita doing there?

415
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.958
Ita!

416
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:36.125
Ita!

417
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:48.208
Ita.

418
00:29:49.291 --> 00:29:50.583
We shouldn't be here, Ita.

419
00:29:50.666 --> 00:29:51.458
Ita?

420
00:29:53.375 --> 00:29:54.541
We can't be here.

421
00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:58.333
Come on.

422
00:29:58.416 --> 00:29:59.500
Ita.

423
00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:03.250
Leave! You shouldn't be here!

424
00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:04.958
The Queen is angry!

425
00:30:06.416 --> 00:30:08.666
Leave!

426
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.333
Ita! Ita!

427
00:30:10.416 --> 00:30:13.500
- Let her go, Ita!
- Hands off!

428
00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:15.208
- Pull her!
- I'm trying!

429
00:30:16.041 --> 00:30:17.875
Ita!

430
00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:21.333
Are you okay?

431
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.583
Indra.

432
00:30:32.416 --> 00:30:33.583
What should we do now?

433
00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.625
Keep hiking or go back?

434
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.916
I have a bad feeling about Ita.

435
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:42.875
Ita.

436
00:30:42.958 --> 00:30:44.291
<i>Istighfar</i>, Ita.

437
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:46.541
Something entered your body.

438
00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:49.458
What do you mean?

439
00:30:50.125 --> 00:30:51.125
Nonsense.

440
00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:56.416
I'm just taking a quick break.

441
00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:00.333
Come on.

442
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.375
Let's keep going.

443
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.208
Let's go.

444
00:31:20.958 --> 00:31:22.875
Ita, are you okay?

445
00:31:24.333 --> 00:31:25.458
What now, Maya?

446
00:31:26.958 --> 00:31:28.708
I'm perfectly fine.

447
00:31:29.958 --> 00:31:31.333
Don't worry.

448
00:31:36.375 --> 00:31:37.375
Oh my God.

449
00:31:41.458 --> 00:31:44.583
What the...?

450
00:31:47.208 --> 00:31:48.125
Maya.

451
00:31:49.375 --> 00:31:51.125
Did you hear a child laughing?

452
00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:52.916
Let's just keep going.

453
00:31:53.458 --> 00:31:54.416
Ignore it.

454
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.875
Ucup. What are you doing?

455
00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:08.958
You're freaking me out.

456
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.541
Just bring up the rear.

457
00:32:12.625 --> 00:32:14.208
Akri, please, don't.

458
00:32:14.291 --> 00:32:16.333
- I don't want to be alone at the back.
- Shut up, Ucup.

459
00:32:23.083 --> 00:32:25.750
Oh my God.

460
00:32:27.541 --> 00:32:28.791
Maya, don't start.

461
00:32:31.541 --> 00:32:33.166
Let's keep going.

462
00:32:36.708 --> 00:32:38.833
Take that kid home.

463
00:32:39.333 --> 00:32:41.583
Ow.

464
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.416
What's wrong?

465
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.416
Ita. Ita!

466
00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:30.291
What was that?

467
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:34.791
What happened?

468
00:33:35.375 --> 00:33:36.375
Ucup.

469
00:33:36.458 --> 00:33:38.000
- What happened?
- Let me help you.

470
00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:39.583
- What happened?!
- Ucup!

471
00:33:39.666 --> 00:33:40.708
Ale.

472
00:33:41.958 --> 00:33:43.666
Something is clearly wrong.

473
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.125
I bet it's because of Ita.

474
00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:49.333
Let's worry about it
once we get to the next post.

475
00:33:49.416 --> 00:33:51.458
We must get out of here now.

476
00:33:52.666 --> 00:33:53.625
Come on.

477
00:33:57.083 --> 00:33:58.250
Maya.

478
00:33:58.333 --> 00:34:00.000
Get up, Maya.

479
00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:22.166
Ouch.

480
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:23.291
Ita?

481
00:34:24.541 --> 00:34:25.625
What's the matter?

482
00:34:27.958 --> 00:34:29.250
My stomach hurts.

483
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.208
Ucup!

484
00:34:33.375 --> 00:34:34.458
Hold up!

485
00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.375
Dang it.

486
00:34:37.458 --> 00:34:39.166
We're never going to get there.

487
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:42.000
Break.

488
00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:45.125
Let's take a break.

489
00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:46.083
Break.

490
00:34:51.958 --> 00:34:54.750
Have some water. Drink it slowly.

491
00:34:55.791 --> 00:34:57.375
Easy, Ita.

492
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.458
Let's just go home, Ita.

493
00:35:02.083 --> 00:35:03.875
Ita! Ita?

494
00:35:06.041 --> 00:35:07.666
Ita! Ale!

495
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.250
Ale, come here!

496
00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:14.500
Ita? Ita, fight back!

497
00:35:14.583 --> 00:35:16.000
Ita!

498
00:35:16.083 --> 00:35:17.166
Ita!

499
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.875
- Ita, fight back!
- Ita, <i>istighfar</i>.

500
00:35:18.958 --> 00:35:20.250
Ita, <i>istighfar</i>.

501
00:35:20.333 --> 00:35:22.000
- Ita.
- Ita, fight it.

502
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.625
This child has to leave the mountain!

503
00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:48.916
This child is filthy!

504
00:35:50.208 --> 00:35:56.208
I don't want this child tainting this place.

505
00:35:56.291 --> 00:35:58.666
- Leave!
<i>- Istighfar,</i> Ta.

506
00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.791
- This child must leave!
- Ita!

507
00:36:01.875 --> 00:36:05.125
Wake up, Ita!

508
00:36:05.208 --> 00:36:07.500
Ita, <i>istighfar</i>!

509
00:36:12.416 --> 00:36:13.416
Ita.

510
00:36:13.958 --> 00:36:15.458
Did anyone understand what she said?

511
00:36:16.208 --> 00:36:17.625
The spirit possessing Ita said

512
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.666
that Ita must leave.

513
00:36:21.291 --> 00:36:22.666
It doesn't want its home tainted.

514
00:36:23.416 --> 00:36:24.875
See? I told you so.

515
00:36:24.958 --> 00:36:27.500
If something goes wrong, I don't care.

516
00:36:27.583 --> 00:36:29.250
I want no part of it.

517
00:36:30.083 --> 00:36:31.083
Ita.

518
00:36:36.875 --> 00:36:38.166
Let's go home.

519
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:41.458
Why, Maya?

520
00:36:42.416 --> 00:36:44.083
Why do you keep telling me to go home?

521
00:36:45.208 --> 00:36:46.708
I want to reach the summit.

522
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:51.375
I want to make memories with you.

523
00:36:53.583 --> 00:36:54.500
Yadi.

524
00:37:03.083 --> 00:37:05.333
Maya. Ita must go home.

525
00:37:06.875 --> 00:37:08.250
I'm not going home.

526
00:37:10.083 --> 00:37:13.541
If you're all going home...

527
00:37:15.875 --> 00:37:16.791
go ahead!

528
00:37:18.291 --> 00:37:19.666
I'll reach the summit by myself.

529
00:37:20.916 --> 00:37:22.750
I know how to get to the top

530
00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:26.250
because this place belongs to me!

531
00:37:31.166 --> 00:37:32.208
Ita.

532
00:37:36.333 --> 00:37:38.166
Wait!

533
00:37:42.708 --> 00:37:43.583
Ita!

534
00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:45.750
- Ita!
- Maya!

535
00:37:47.083 --> 00:37:48.041
Maya!

536
00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:50.541
- Ita!
- Maya!

537
00:37:52.583 --> 00:37:53.708
What do we do now?

538
00:37:54.416 --> 00:37:55.583
That's not Ita.

539
00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:02.000
Can you see who's possessing Ita?

540
00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:07.791
I feel strange.

541
00:38:09.833 --> 00:38:12.125
I don't think
the spirits here like us very much.

542
00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:14.166
I'm scared.

543
00:38:16.083 --> 00:38:17.541
Where's Ita?

544
00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:18.666
She's gone!

545
00:38:20.583 --> 00:38:22.375
Ita!

546
00:38:23.083 --> 00:38:25.458
- Ita!
- Ita!

547
00:38:25.541 --> 00:38:27.250
Ita!

548
00:38:27.333 --> 00:38:28.416
Ita!

549
00:38:28.916 --> 00:38:30.166
Ita!

550
00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:31.541
Ita!

551
00:38:33.291 --> 00:38:34.166
Ita!

552
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.625
- Ita.
- Wait!

553
00:38:35.708 --> 00:38:37.208
This is because you wouldn't listen to me!

554
00:38:37.625 --> 00:38:39.375
Now look at the mess we're in!

555
00:38:39.458 --> 00:38:42.166
- What do you want now?
- What?

556
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.125
Do you think I wanted this?

557
00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:46.541
Don't you see how Ita is right now?

558
00:38:46.625 --> 00:38:47.958
Stop!

559
00:38:48.625 --> 00:38:51.041
This is no time to fight.
Ita is still missing!

560
00:38:51.125 --> 00:38:52.083
I know, Ale!

561
00:38:52.166 --> 00:38:53.541
Our trip was supposed to be fun!

562
00:38:53.625 --> 00:38:55.000
I know, but Ita is missing right now!

563
00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:56.166
Enough!

564
00:38:56.791 --> 00:38:58.333
Stop fighting!

565
00:38:58.416 --> 00:39:00.791
I'm sorry if my friend caused trouble,

566
00:39:01.958 --> 00:39:03.625
but it wasn't her doing.

567
00:39:04.166 --> 00:39:05.500
We must help her.

568
00:39:11.125 --> 00:39:12.250
We have to get out of here.

569
00:39:13.041 --> 00:39:14.375
What's the matter, Maya?

570
00:39:18.708 --> 00:39:20.541
Indra. Let's go. Hurry!

571
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:22.291
Leave!

572
00:39:22.375 --> 00:39:23.208
Let's go, Yadi!

573
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:24.291
Yadi, hurry!

574
00:39:24.875 --> 00:39:26.041
Leave!

575
00:39:59.916 --> 00:40:01.000
Ita!

576
00:40:09.375 --> 00:40:10.416
Ita.

577
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.416
Are you sure
you want to keep going up with Ita?

578
00:40:15.666 --> 00:40:16.708
Huh?

579
00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:19.750
You all saw what just happened, right?

580
00:40:20.583 --> 00:40:21.833
Or was I the only one?

581
00:40:23.208 --> 00:40:24.458
I can't believe this.

582
00:40:25.041 --> 00:40:27.500
Are you all acting blind
or are you just plain stupid?

583
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:32.166
I'm tired, Maya.

584
00:40:33.041 --> 00:40:34.000
I know.

585
00:40:35.458 --> 00:40:37.291
We can't reach the top like this.

586
00:40:39.166 --> 00:40:40.583
We can.

587
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.208
I'm sure we can.

588
00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:55.375
Ita.

589
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:08.791
Maya.

590
00:41:10.625 --> 00:41:13.250
We must keep going, okay?

591
00:41:14.916 --> 00:41:17.583
Once we're done, you're going to miss...

592
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.750
hiking with me.

593
00:41:43.541 --> 00:41:46.916
We've come this far.

594
00:41:48.375 --> 00:41:51.166
I'm sure Ita will be okay
once we reach the top.

595
00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:34.416
Ita.

596
00:42:36.708 --> 00:42:37.958
Do you want my jacket?

597
00:42:40.916 --> 00:42:41.791
I'm okay.

598
00:42:47.958 --> 00:42:49.125
Can you keep going?

599
00:42:50.541 --> 00:42:52.833
We can pause for a bit at Kandang Batu.

600
00:42:53.541 --> 00:42:54.625
Take a break.

601
00:42:57.416 --> 00:42:58.541
No.

602
00:42:59.958 --> 00:43:00.791
Don't stop.

603
00:43:02.208 --> 00:43:03.625
We'll keep going.

604
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.541
We've come this far.

605
00:43:08.958 --> 00:43:10.291
I want to reach the top.

606
00:44:06.416 --> 00:44:07.458
Hey!

607
00:44:40.583 --> 00:44:43.458
MOUNT GEDE
2,958 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL

608
00:44:55.583 --> 00:44:57.916
If everything had gone smoothly,

609
00:44:58.708 --> 00:45:01.375
we would've had more time at the peak.

610
00:45:01.458 --> 00:45:02.750
Akri.

611
00:45:03.416 --> 00:45:04.375
Enough.

612
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.375
Sorry for causing trouble.

613
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:13.166
It's okay, Ita.

614
00:45:15.416 --> 00:45:17.083
No matter how short we stay,

615
00:45:18.291 --> 00:45:20.458
what matters is that we got here.

616
00:45:21.083 --> 00:45:22.958
Thanks for putting up with me.

617
00:45:25.041 --> 00:45:26.458
I'm so glad.

618
00:45:54.958 --> 00:45:56.000
The tent is ready.

619
00:45:56.083 --> 00:45:59.041
We can rest inside and lie down.

620
00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:01.333
Come on.

621
00:46:03.708 --> 00:46:04.875
Careful.

622
00:46:12.416 --> 00:46:14.333
Ita.

623
00:46:14.416 --> 00:46:16.375
What's wrong? Ita!

624
00:46:16.458 --> 00:46:17.416
Indra, help!

625
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.708
- Ita!
- What's wrong, Ita?

626
00:46:19.791 --> 00:46:22.041
Ita! Ita!

627
00:46:22.125 --> 00:46:23.750
Ita! Wake up!

628
00:46:23.833 --> 00:46:25.166
- Ita!
- Wake up!

629
00:46:27.875 --> 00:46:30.166
Ita, wake up.

630
00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:32.583
- What do we do?
- Ita, wake up.

631
00:46:33.875 --> 00:46:35.041
Fight back!

632
00:46:36.083 --> 00:46:37.875
Ita! Look at me!

633
00:46:37.958 --> 00:46:40.541
Wake up! Look at me!

634
00:46:41.458 --> 00:46:42.583
Ita!

635
00:46:43.208 --> 00:46:45.500
Indra, check Ita's bag.

636
00:46:45.583 --> 00:46:47.166
Maybe she brought something with her.

637
00:46:51.625 --> 00:46:54.125
- Indra?
- Search her bag, Ale.

638
00:46:55.958 --> 00:46:58.333
- What's wrong?
- Check it.

639
00:46:58.416 --> 00:47:00.875
There's nothing in here, Ale.

640
00:47:05.375 --> 00:47:07.458
Ita, wake up, please!

641
00:47:07.541 --> 00:47:08.583
Wake up!

642
00:47:08.666 --> 00:47:10.666
Ita, please.

643
00:47:11.541 --> 00:47:13.541
- Wake up.
- Let's get help for Ita.

644
00:47:13.625 --> 00:47:14.916
Find someone.

645
00:47:22.458 --> 00:47:23.833
Excuse me.

646
00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:27.250
- Yes?
- Can you help us?

647
00:47:27.875 --> 00:47:29.541
My friend has been possessed.

648
00:47:29.625 --> 00:47:30.750
Is it a girl?

649
00:47:30.833 --> 00:47:31.625
Yeah.

650
00:47:32.125 --> 00:47:36.541
She's probably just seeking attention.
Don't mind it.

651
00:47:36.625 --> 00:47:40.375
Girls are good at acting.
Just ignore it and she'll be fine.

652
00:47:40.458 --> 00:47:42.375
Give her some cash.

653
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.125
She'll wake up in no time.

654
00:47:44.208 --> 00:47:45.541
Fuck you!

655
00:47:46.208 --> 00:47:47.375
That's my friend!

656
00:47:47.458 --> 00:47:49.166
What? Easy, there.

657
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:52.625
No, you watch your mouth, bastard.

658
00:47:52.708 --> 00:47:54.541
- You want to have a go?
- You bastards!

659
00:47:54.625 --> 00:47:56.125
Come at me if you dare!

660
00:47:59.375 --> 00:48:01.208
Enough!

661
00:48:01.291 --> 00:48:02.333
What is going on?

662
00:48:02.958 --> 00:48:04.291
Don't start a fight here.

663
00:48:05.833 --> 00:48:07.708
Mountains are sacred.

664
00:48:08.458 --> 00:48:09.375
Be respectful.

665
00:48:18.958 --> 00:48:20.000
Indra.

666
00:48:20.083 --> 00:48:22.541
What do we do? She won't stop bleeding.

667
00:48:25.083 --> 00:48:27.500
Indra, please help Ita.

668
00:48:29.208 --> 00:48:30.583
Get her a new mat.

669
00:48:30.666 --> 00:48:32.583
And you, clean her up.

670
00:48:33.541 --> 00:48:34.750
Give her some new pants.

671
00:48:46.625 --> 00:48:50.500
<i>Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!</i>

672
00:48:52.583 --> 00:48:55.500
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

673
00:48:55.583 --> 00:48:59.708
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

674
00:49:02.041 --> 00:49:06.250
<i>- Ashhadu alla ilaha illallah.</i>
- They're reciting the adhan.

675
00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:16.541
<i>Ashhadu alla ilaha illallah...</i>

676
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:27.916
<i>Ashhadu anna muhammadar rasulullah.</i>

677
00:49:31.125 --> 00:49:40.458
<i>Ashhadu anna muhammadar rasulullah.</i>

678
00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:46.375
<i>Hayya alas Salah.</i>

679
00:49:50.041 --> 00:49:53.416
<i>Hayya alas Salah.</i>

680
00:49:59.291 --> 00:50:04.875
<i>Hayya alal Falah.</i>

681
00:50:06.625 --> 00:50:12.791
<i>Hayya alal Falah.</i>

682
00:50:14.833 --> 00:50:17.416
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

683
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:22.791
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

684
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:31.375
<i>La ilaha illallah.</i>

685
00:50:34.958 --> 00:50:36.333
God have mercy.

686
00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:45.375
Relax.

687
00:50:46.916 --> 00:50:48.041
Calm down.

688
00:50:49.125 --> 00:50:50.375
<i>Istighfar</i>.

689
00:50:55.208 --> 00:50:56.791
I'm scared, sir.

690
00:50:56.875 --> 00:50:58.208
You must not be afraid.

691
00:50:59.333 --> 00:51:01.625
<i>Istighfar</i>. Just pray.

692
00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:05.666
Dear?

693
00:51:07.166 --> 00:51:08.791
Dear, open the door.

694
00:51:13.375 --> 00:51:16.333
Dear. I heard the sound again.

695
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:22.666
And it felt like someone
was watching me as I did dhikr.

696
00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:27.416
You're imagining things.
There is no such thing.

697
00:51:28.291 --> 00:51:30.958
It's all in your head.

698
00:51:38.708 --> 00:51:40.541
Get rid of all negative thoughts.

699
00:51:41.166 --> 00:51:42.375
Got it?

700
00:51:42.458 --> 00:51:43.916
- Thanks, sir.
- You're welcome.

701
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.416
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

702
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:58.833
Let's go to bed.

703
00:52:00.333 --> 00:52:01.958
We can sleep for a few hours.

704
00:52:04.958 --> 00:52:06.583
We'll spend the night outside

705
00:52:07.708 --> 00:52:09.250
so Ita and Maya can use the tent.

706
00:52:10.583 --> 00:52:12.708
We'll head back after breakfast tomorrow.

707
00:52:29.833 --> 00:52:31.166
Maya.

708
00:52:31.875 --> 00:52:33.541
It hurts.

709
00:52:36.541 --> 00:52:38.250
I want to go home.

710
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:53.208
This child has tainted this place.

711
00:52:53.291 --> 00:52:55.041
The child must leave.

712
00:52:55.125 --> 00:52:56.250
Leave!

713
00:53:22.708 --> 00:53:23.750
Ita.

714
00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:31.750
Ita!

715
00:53:32.708 --> 00:53:33.875
Ita!

716
00:53:58.708 --> 00:53:59.625
Ita?

717
00:54:08.833 --> 00:54:09.708
Ita?

718
00:54:19.666 --> 00:54:20.583
Maya.

719
00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:23.625
What are you doing here?

720
00:54:25.083 --> 00:54:28.583
I was just chatting with my friend.

721
00:54:36.083 --> 00:54:37.541
Right?

722
00:54:38.458 --> 00:54:40.958
Ita. Come back to the tent.

723
00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:42.333
I don't want to.

724
00:54:42.416 --> 00:54:43.833
We're going back now!

725
00:54:43.916 --> 00:54:46.916
Back off! She's mine now!

726
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.041
Ita.

727
00:54:48.125 --> 00:54:49.750
She's not Ita.

728
00:54:49.833 --> 00:54:51.875
She's not your friend Ita.

729
00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:06.375
Go away! Leave my friend alone!

730
00:55:06.916 --> 00:55:08.083
Get lost!

731
00:55:16.583 --> 00:55:17.541
Maya.

732
00:55:20.916 --> 00:55:22.000
Ita.

733
00:55:23.208 --> 00:55:24.291
Why are we here?

734
00:55:25.208 --> 00:55:27.958
Enough. We're going back to the tent.

735
00:55:28.041 --> 00:55:30.208
Stop! Don't look back!

736
00:55:54.708 --> 00:55:55.791
Ale.

737
00:55:56.541 --> 00:55:57.791
Ale.

738
00:55:57.875 --> 00:55:59.375
Wake up.

739
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:14.875
Ucup.

740
00:56:15.583 --> 00:56:16.708
Wake up, Ucup.

741
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.041
Hey, Yadi.

742
00:56:23.708 --> 00:56:24.750
Wake up.

743
00:56:32.416 --> 00:56:33.500
Hey.

744
00:56:35.583 --> 00:56:37.541
Did anyone see
that man who helped us leave?

745
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.083
We only slept for a few hours.

746
00:56:46.583 --> 00:56:48.500
There's no way he left that fast.

747
00:56:51.166 --> 00:56:54.625
I knew it. I suspected something was off.

748
00:56:55.458 --> 00:56:58.541
We're all bundled up in layers
and wearing shoes.

749
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:00.958
But he was only wearing
a T-shirt and sandals.

750
00:57:01.041 --> 00:57:02.708
- Enough.
- He wore sandals!

751
00:57:03.666 --> 00:57:04.750
Enough about it.

752
00:57:17.125 --> 00:57:18.250
Ita.

753
00:57:20.166 --> 00:57:21.250
Wake up.

754
00:57:30.375 --> 00:57:32.083
Ita was fine last night, right?

755
00:57:34.708 --> 00:57:35.916
Yeah.

756
00:57:39.375 --> 00:57:41.541
Maya, go with her.

757
00:58:15.458 --> 00:58:16.500
Ita.

758
00:58:17.083 --> 00:58:18.166
Come on.

759
00:58:19.833 --> 00:58:21.000
It's about time for us to go.

760
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:24.625
I'm so at ease here.

761
00:58:28.625 --> 00:58:30.541
It feels like I was born here.

762
00:58:36.375 --> 00:58:38.083
I feel like I could stay forever.

763
00:58:41.458 --> 00:58:42.583
No, Ita.

764
00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:47.041
Any longer and it'll be dark
by the time we descend.

765
00:58:52.666 --> 00:58:54.708
But this is the most relaxing place
I've ever been.

766
00:58:56.041 --> 00:58:58.291
Don't say that, Ita. Let's go home.

767
00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:07.291
What's up with that rock?

768
00:59:10.916 --> 00:59:13.291
I'm sure you'll cry if you come back here.

769
00:59:14.458 --> 00:59:15.458
Why?

770
00:59:17.708 --> 00:59:18.750
Why would I cry?

771
00:59:22.958 --> 00:59:24.041
Yeah.

772
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.583
You'll come back here one day...

773
00:59:32.916 --> 00:59:33.958
and see me.

774
00:59:39.958 --> 00:59:41.250
Let's go home, Ita.

775
00:59:47.458 --> 00:59:48.541
<i>Before going back,</i>

776
00:59:48.625 --> 00:59:50.708
<i>let's all pray.</i>

777
00:59:51.916 --> 00:59:56.291
<i>May our journey be smooth,</i>

778
00:59:56.375 --> 00:59:59.791
<i>and may we return home safely
in one piece.</i>

779
01:00:07.166 --> 01:00:08.583
Am I wearing your shirt?

780
01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:11.708
Yeah. I changed your clothes.

781
01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:14.541
They were soaked in sweat last night.

782
01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:16.791
I didn't want you to catch a cold.

783
01:00:21.208 --> 01:00:22.375
You're so kind, Maya.

784
01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:25.416
Thanks.

785
01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:28.625
I'll return it to you later.

786
01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:31.541
It's fine.

787
01:00:32.041 --> 01:00:33.125
You can keep it.

788
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.250
We're stopping for a break up ahead.

789
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.083
Maya.

790
01:01:14.666 --> 01:01:16.791
I think I've left something behind.

791
01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:19.500
What did you leave behind?

792
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:26.375
I'm not sure what it is.

793
01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:31.416
What's up, Yadi?

794
01:01:31.958 --> 01:01:34.083
I feel like we're one person short.

795
01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:36.958
You didn't finish grade school or what?

796
01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:39.916
You seriously can't count?

797
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:45.250
There are seven of us, but when I count,
I feel like we're one short.

798
01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:49.541
Wait, no.

799
01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:52.500
Either we're missing one person

800
01:01:53.958 --> 01:01:55.208
or we have an extra.

801
01:01:57.083 --> 01:01:58.625
Let's continue.

802
01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:11.958
Is your diploma fake?

803
01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:14.583
You can't even do basic counting.

804
01:02:31.458 --> 01:02:32.416
Ita.

805
01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:34.250
Come on.

806
01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:45.458
If you come here again one day,

807
01:02:47.125 --> 01:02:48.500
and you see me,

808
01:02:50.291 --> 01:02:51.500
take me with you.

809
01:03:00.791 --> 01:03:02.125
SECOND POST

810
01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:34.333
No matter what happens,
will you still be my best friend?

811
01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:38.166
Of course, Ita.

812
01:03:39.833 --> 01:03:43.083
I'll always be your best friend.

813
01:03:52.041 --> 01:03:54.541
Hello, ma'am. I'm here to drop Ita off.

814
01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:58.416
Get a good rest.

815
01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:34.333
Thank God you're home.

816
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.666
No need to worry.

817
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:47.916
Maya and Indra are home.
They used the back door.

818
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.333
What? Not the front?

819
01:04:50.416 --> 01:04:53.791
They're washing up.
They're dirty from the mountains.

820
01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:20.208
Oh my God.

821
01:05:24.875 --> 01:05:26.458
What is it, Mom?

822
01:05:26.541 --> 01:05:29.416
Then who was it I saw back there?

823
01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:33.125
Give me a break.

824
01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:39.000
I'm tired, Mom. I need some rest.

825
01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:13.458
Maya, wake up.

826
01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:14.833
Wake up!

827
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:17.958
Ita's mom called.

828
01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:21.958
Why?

829
01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:24.708
Ita's been crying nonstop.

830
01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:26.208
Go get dressed quickly.

831
01:06:32.666 --> 01:06:37.750
Come to your senses.

832
01:06:44.416 --> 01:06:45.625
Ma'am.

833
01:06:48.166 --> 01:06:49.208
Maya.

834
01:06:50.166 --> 01:06:54.208
What's wrong with Ita?
What happened back there?

835
01:06:54.291 --> 01:06:56.750
I don't know, ma'am.
But Ita had her period there.

836
01:07:05.541 --> 01:07:07.375
Who are you?

837
01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:11.500
If this child has said
or done something wrong,

838
01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:12.791
please forgive her.

839
01:07:14.583 --> 01:07:18.750
We are all God's creations,
living alongside each other.

840
01:07:19.666 --> 01:07:21.833
Please, let's not disturb each other.

841
01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:29.125
Ustad, please help Ita. Help my daughter.

842
01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:34.500
What if something happens to her?
Please help her, Ustad!

843
01:07:37.083 --> 01:07:40.083
There's no demon that can kill a human.

844
01:07:40.875 --> 01:07:42.791
Ita...

845
01:07:46.375 --> 01:07:48.791
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

846
01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:01.166
Ita, stop.

847
01:08:02.041 --> 01:08:03.875
Ita!

848
01:08:03.958 --> 01:08:07.333
Ita! Stop! Cut it out!

849
01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:09.500
Ita!

850
01:08:16.583 --> 01:08:18.791
Ustad!

851
01:08:18.875 --> 01:08:20.666
We must take her to the hospital!

852
01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:34.083
The needle broke.

853
01:08:34.583 --> 01:08:36.500
Sir, ma'am. Please wait outside.

854
01:08:51.458 --> 01:08:52.583
Look.

855
01:08:53.208 --> 01:08:54.500
Look at her!

856
01:08:56.125 --> 01:08:57.458
You did this!

857
01:08:59.166 --> 01:09:01.791
What did she do wrong?

858
01:09:04.208 --> 01:09:06.250
I'm sorry, sir, ma'am.

859
01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:10.125
We also don't know why it happened.

860
01:09:11.375 --> 01:09:14.750
Sir, we tried to get Ita to go home,
but she insisted...

861
01:09:14.833 --> 01:09:17.583
When Ita left, she was fine.

862
01:09:17.666 --> 01:09:18.625
Enough, dear.

863
01:09:18.708 --> 01:09:20.458
Now, she's come home like this!

864
01:09:24.916 --> 01:09:26.125
You must take responsibility.

865
01:09:27.333 --> 01:09:29.333
I will report you to the police.

866
01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:33.000
Dear, don't start a fight here.

867
01:09:33.083 --> 01:09:34.125
Pardon me.

868
01:09:36.125 --> 01:09:37.500
Well, Doctor?

869
01:09:37.583 --> 01:09:42.250
I've given her anesthesia twice
to calm her down.

870
01:09:42.333 --> 01:09:46.000
The wounds on her fingers
have been treated and bandaged.

871
01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:49.583
I don't want to say this,

872
01:09:49.666 --> 01:09:54.666
but if after observation,
her illness is found

873
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:56.125
to be beyond medical care,

874
01:09:56.208 --> 01:09:57.625
I'm sorry,

875
01:09:58.333 --> 01:10:00.541
but we won't be able to treat her here.

876
01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:09.875
Remember. You're responsible for this.

877
01:10:16.916 --> 01:10:19.166
BHAKTI BANGSA HIGH SCHOOL

878
01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:25.291
Maya.

879
01:10:51.833 --> 01:10:55.500
Everyone, submit your papers
in ten minutes.

880
01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.541
Please watch her for a bit.

881
01:11:26.625 --> 01:11:27.708
I'm going outside.

882
01:11:59.833 --> 01:12:00.875
Ita.

883
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.083
Have you eaten?

884
01:12:06.541 --> 01:12:07.750
It's okay.

885
01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:10.875
Make sure to eat later.

886
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.750
Have a bite or two to keep you filled up.

887
01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:29.250
Did I do something wrong?

888
01:12:31.416 --> 01:12:32.833
No, Ita.

889
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:38.125
I'm scared, Maya.

890
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:42.916
Nurse.

891
01:12:45.916 --> 01:12:48.375
Can you please untie my hand?

892
01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:50.375
Just one?

893
01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:51.458
I'm sorry, I can't.

894
01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:55.208
It's fine. I'll keep an eye on her.

895
01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:57.208
All right, but just for a little while, okay?

896
01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:21.791
Please don't leave me, Maya.

897
01:13:29.041 --> 01:13:31.000
I will never leave you, Ita.

898
01:13:35.416 --> 01:13:37.166
I'll keep praying for you...

899
01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:40.125
until you're fully recovered.

900
01:13:44.541 --> 01:13:45.625
Amen.

901
01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:02.375
Ma'am.

902
01:14:09.208 --> 01:14:11.041
I've already accepted it.

903
01:14:14.958 --> 01:14:17.000
Don't say that.

904
01:14:18.333 --> 01:14:20.041
Ita will recover.

905
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.041
The doctor confirmed

906
01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:28.083
that Ita's illness isn't
a medical complication.

907
01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:36.583
I even called several <i>kiai</i>
to cure her last night,

908
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:39.250
but none of them could help.

909
01:14:42.916 --> 01:14:45.291
Only one of them said...

910
01:14:47.541 --> 01:14:50.416
that Ita must bring back a certain item.

911
01:14:52.625 --> 01:14:54.041
What item?

912
01:14:55.333 --> 01:14:56.583
I don't know.

913
01:14:57.875 --> 01:14:59.541
I have no clue

914
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:02.958
and neither does Ita.

915
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:10.500
She said she didn't leave
or throw anything away there.

916
01:15:19.041 --> 01:15:20.750
Poor Ita.

917
01:15:20.833 --> 01:15:22.541
Her stomach is swelling up too.

918
01:15:24.875 --> 01:15:26.000
I swear, Maya.

919
01:15:26.583 --> 01:15:28.625
We searched her bag.

920
01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:32.291
We checked every single item.

921
01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:33.375
There was nothing.

922
01:15:34.916 --> 01:15:37.541
Ask the others if you don't believe me.

923
01:15:38.833 --> 01:15:41.750
Did you see the plastic bag
with Ita's bloodied underwear?

924
01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:44.583
She might have thrown it away carelessly
on the mountain.

925
01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:45.666
Yes.

926
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.500
<i>Ucup found it...</i>

927
01:15:47.583 --> 01:15:49.166
<i>...when he was packing Ita's bag.</i>

928
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:51.541
I gotta deal with used underwear?

929
01:15:55.416 --> 01:15:58.958
So what's the item she must bring back?

930
01:16:00.041 --> 01:16:02.375
I remember when we were heading down,

931
01:16:03.041 --> 01:16:04.291
Ita mentioned

932
01:16:05.583 --> 01:16:08.208
feeling like she'd left something behind,

933
01:16:08.291 --> 01:16:10.041
but she wasn't sure what it was.

934
01:16:10.125 --> 01:16:13.041
Enough, Maya. Let's stop getting involved.

935
01:16:13.666 --> 01:16:15.500
You heard her dad too.

936
01:16:16.708 --> 01:16:18.041
He'd report us to the police.

937
01:16:36.541 --> 01:16:37.583
Are you here for someone?

938
01:16:38.083 --> 01:16:39.125
Mister.

939
01:18:20.458 --> 01:18:21.708
Maya,

940
01:18:21.791 --> 01:18:23.041
how is Ita doing?

941
01:18:23.958 --> 01:18:25.291
Has she recovered?

942
01:18:39.041 --> 01:18:40.000
Maya.

943
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.541
Yes, Ita?

944
01:18:44.833 --> 01:18:48.250
Every night, I'm visited by this dark...

945
01:18:50.416 --> 01:18:51.458
tall figure.

946
01:18:53.375 --> 01:18:54.916
It's terrifying.

947
01:18:57.958 --> 01:19:00.333
Why does it keep visiting me?

948
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:05.875
I'm scared, Maya.

949
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.125
You're probably just dreaming it.

950
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.833
That's enough. Don't think about it.

951
01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:18.791
<i>There's just no way</i>

952
01:19:20.333 --> 01:19:23.833
<i>that this is happening solely because she
went hiking while she was on her period.</i>

953
01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:28.000
I once went hiking

954
01:19:29.208 --> 01:19:30.916
and there was a girl in my group

955
01:19:32.083 --> 01:19:33.416
who got her period.

956
01:19:35.041 --> 01:19:36.833
Thankfully, everything's okay.

957
01:19:38.083 --> 01:19:39.333
Nothing happened.

958
01:19:39.416 --> 01:19:40.375
See?

959
01:19:40.916 --> 01:19:44.000
I'm sure this has nothing to do
with Ita being on her period.

960
01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:50.041
Remember what I said back there?

961
01:19:51.125 --> 01:19:54.833
I kept feeling like we were
missing someone or had one extra person.

962
01:19:56.666 --> 01:19:57.750
Or maybe

963
01:19:57.833 --> 01:20:01.416
Ita had something with her before the hike

964
01:20:02.666 --> 01:20:05.208
which caused the mountain's guardian
to get angry.

965
01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:12.791
Ita told me yesterday

966
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.833
that something always visits her.

967
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:21.125
A tall and scary figure.

968
01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:25.250
The figure Ita described

969
01:20:26.416 --> 01:20:29.416
is very similar
to the one I saw at her place.

970
01:20:31.541 --> 01:20:33.208
How is she doing now?

971
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:35.083
Stop.

972
01:20:38.791 --> 01:20:40.208
Here's your helmet.

973
01:20:40.291 --> 01:20:41.416
Thanks.

974
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.583
Ita.

975
01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:03.375
Wake up.

976
01:21:21.625 --> 01:21:24.083
You guys must be ashamed
to have me as a friend.

977
01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.708
Always being a burden.

978
01:21:29.708 --> 01:21:30.750
No, Ita.

979
01:21:31.875 --> 01:21:33.291
We're glad to be your friends.

980
01:21:36.375 --> 01:21:38.541
We hope you get better

981
01:21:39.541 --> 01:21:41.125
so you can go home.

982
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:55.875
Maya.

983
01:21:58.041 --> 01:22:00.041
Who is that staring at me?

984
01:22:11.541 --> 01:22:12.708
There's no one there.

985
01:22:14.708 --> 01:22:15.750
It's in your head.

986
01:22:17.875 --> 01:22:18.916
No, Maya.

987
01:22:19.625 --> 01:22:21.333
It's always staring at me.

988
01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:41.666
Oh my God.

989
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:44.125
When someone knocks on the door,
you open it.

990
01:22:44.208 --> 01:22:45.625
Maya!

991
01:22:46.833 --> 01:22:47.875
Maya.

992
01:22:49.291 --> 01:22:51.333
Someone's knocking on the door.

993
01:22:51.416 --> 01:22:52.458
Open it.

994
01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:53.625
I'm going to pray.

995
01:22:54.416 --> 01:22:56.041
Okay, Mom. Sorry.

996
01:23:06.458 --> 01:23:07.500
Ita?

997
01:23:08.333 --> 01:23:09.541
Oh my God, Ita!

998
01:23:11.333 --> 01:23:13.041
You're back.

999
01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:17.333
I'm all better now.

1000
01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:20.041
But why did you come here?

1001
01:23:20.875 --> 01:23:22.625
I could have visited your place.

1002
01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:24.750
I wanted to return your shirt.

1003
01:23:27.375 --> 01:23:29.416
Come on, it's just a shirt.

1004
01:23:30.583 --> 01:23:31.791
Fine.

1005
01:23:32.791 --> 01:23:33.958
It's yours now.

1006
01:23:34.916 --> 01:23:36.041
No.

1007
01:23:36.625 --> 01:23:37.791
This is yours.

1008
01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:41.291
It's my gift to you.

1009
01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:44.583
Thanks, Maya.

1010
01:23:46.666 --> 01:23:48.000
I'm going home.

1011
01:23:48.708 --> 01:23:49.750
Okay.

1012
01:23:50.541 --> 01:23:51.916
I'll come over tomorrow.

1013
01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:53.541
I'll stay the night too.

1014
01:24:21.833 --> 01:24:23.875
Maya, wake up! Maya!

1015
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.083
Maya!

1016
01:24:28.375 --> 01:24:29.500
Wake up!

1017
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.833
Maya, let's go to the hospital. Now!

1018
01:24:32.541 --> 01:24:34.000
Why? Ita is already home.

1019
01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:35.166
No, she's not.

1020
01:24:36.041 --> 01:24:37.041
Hurry.

1021
01:24:45.625 --> 01:24:47.041
Please wait outside.

1022
01:24:47.125 --> 01:24:48.500
Ita!

1023
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.083
Ita!

1024
01:24:52.958 --> 01:24:55.083
Wake up, Ita!

1025
01:24:55.166 --> 01:24:59.125
Ita, please don't leave me! Dear, our Ita!

1026
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.083
Ita!

1027
01:25:01.708 --> 01:25:03.625
Ita!

1028
01:25:03.708 --> 01:25:05.833
Wake up!

1029
01:25:05.916 --> 01:25:09.958
Don't leave me. Oh God! Ita!

1030
01:25:11.041 --> 01:25:14.666
Ita...

1031
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:17.416
No... Ita...

1032
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:20.958
Ita!

1033
01:25:22.125 --> 01:25:24.000
Ita!

1034
01:25:26.375 --> 01:25:29.375
Ita. Ita!

1035
01:25:31.125 --> 01:25:33.291
No! Ita!

1036
01:25:37.208 --> 01:25:39.458
Ita!

1037
01:25:59.041 --> 01:26:00.500
Ita, wake up.

1038
01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:04.250
Ita, wake up!

1039
01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:07.458
Ita!

1040
01:26:08.666 --> 01:26:12.458
It feels like only yesterday I had Ita.

1041
01:26:13.333 --> 01:26:16.500
But now she's gone.

1042
01:26:16.583 --> 01:26:20.416
Ita, wake up!

1043
01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.250
Ita!

1044
01:26:22.916 --> 01:26:26.541
Ita, don't leave me.

1045
01:26:27.458 --> 01:26:29.208
Ita, please don't go!

1046
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:30.958
I can't take this anymore.

1047
01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:33.083
Don't go.

1048
01:26:34.083 --> 01:26:36.625
Please...

1049
01:26:36.708 --> 01:26:42.833
Ita, wake up!

1050
01:26:42.916 --> 01:26:44.500
Dear...

1051
01:26:44.583 --> 01:26:47.833
- Ita! Oh my God...
- Shh...

1052
01:26:49.291 --> 01:26:52.458
Dear...

1053
01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:53.625
Come on.

1054
01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:55.041
No...

1055
01:26:55.125 --> 01:26:56.208
Stay strong.

1056
01:27:06.791 --> 01:27:09.666
That person was always there
near Ita in the hospital.

1057
01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:12.708
I've seen him before.

1058
01:27:13.541 --> 01:27:14.708
That's him, dear!

1059
01:27:15.291 --> 01:27:16.333
Who are you?

1060
01:27:16.416 --> 01:27:19.666
What are you doing here?!
Get out of here!

1061
01:27:21.291 --> 01:27:22.375
Go.

1062
01:27:23.333 --> 01:27:24.750
I said go away!

1063
01:27:55.875 --> 01:27:58.333
I'm sorry, Ita.

1064
01:27:59.833 --> 01:28:03.333
I love you so much. Forgive me.

1065
01:28:03.416 --> 01:28:05.291
BORN - 05/05/1990 DIED - 13/07/2007

1066
01:28:05.375 --> 01:28:06.500
<i>I know</i>

1067
01:28:07.458 --> 01:28:09.750
<i>this is hard for you.</i>

1068
01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:14.250
I'm sure you're thinking about her.

1069
01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:19.125
But I don't want you to get sick.

1070
01:28:21.583 --> 01:28:23.250
Eat something, okay?

1071
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:26.708
Ita is at peace now.

1072
01:28:27.125 --> 01:28:28.583
Don't think about it too much.

1073
01:28:29.791 --> 01:28:30.791
Yes, I know.

1074
01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:35.333
But I can't find peace
until I get some answers.

1075
01:28:35.416 --> 01:28:38.500
And if you do, will Ita come back to life?

1076
01:28:41.208 --> 01:28:42.958
Maya, let it go.

1077
01:28:44.458 --> 01:28:46.416
It's best to pray for Ita.

1078
01:28:46.958 --> 01:28:48.875
I always prayed for her.

1079
01:28:51.916 --> 01:28:54.166
My prayers for her never ended.

1080
01:28:57.416 --> 01:28:59.416
I prayed for her recovery.

1081
01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:02.541
So she could go back to school.

1082
01:29:03.708 --> 01:29:05.916
So she could play with me again.

1083
01:29:07.708 --> 01:29:09.708
This isn't fair on her!

1084
01:29:21.875 --> 01:29:24.041
<i>Only one of the</i> kiai <i>said</i>

1085
01:29:25.375 --> 01:29:27.833
<i>that Ita must bring back a certain item.</i>

1086
01:29:28.375 --> 01:29:29.416
<i>Maya.</i>

1087
01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.291
I think I've left something behind.

1088
01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:33.166
What did you leave behind?

1089
01:29:33.916 --> 01:29:35.291
I don't know.

1090
01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:41.041
<i>She said she didn't leave
or throw anything away there.</i>

1091
01:29:43.125 --> 01:29:45.791
<i>Leave!</i>

1092
01:29:46.666 --> 01:29:47.791
Ita.

1093
01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:51.958
Please take this
and throw it away far from here.

1094
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:08.625
Mom!

1095
01:30:10.458 --> 01:30:13.375
What was the thing you gave Ita
when she said goodbye to you?

1096
01:30:15.125 --> 01:30:16.166
What was it?

1097
01:30:18.666 --> 01:30:20.125
No. Don't!

1098
01:30:20.208 --> 01:30:21.291
- Move!
- Dear!

1099
01:30:21.375 --> 01:30:22.416
Let me go!

1100
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:26.291
What is this?

1101
01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:28.750
This is blasphemy.

1102
01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:32.333
This is what haunted Ita on Mount Gede.

1103
01:30:37.166 --> 01:30:39.166
What have you done?

1104
01:30:41.666 --> 01:30:42.791
Answer me.

1105
01:30:43.208 --> 01:30:45.291
What have you done? Answer me!

1106
01:30:45.375 --> 01:30:46.375
Fine, I'll explain!

1107
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:50.833
You know...

1108
01:30:55.041 --> 01:30:57.208
how my business
has been in decline lately,

1109
01:30:59.083 --> 01:31:01.041
ever since that middleman appeared?

1110
01:31:02.416 --> 01:31:04.000
I couldn't stand it, dear.

1111
01:31:06.333 --> 01:31:09.458
I tried to find a way
to destroy his business.

1112
01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:13.333
But he retaliated by sending black magic

1113
01:31:14.875 --> 01:31:16.375
<i>to ruin mine.</i>

1114
01:31:19.125 --> 01:31:21.083
<i>I never thought...</i>

1115
01:31:24.708 --> 01:31:27.291
<i>that Ita would be the one
to bear the burden.</i>

1116
01:31:29.208 --> 01:31:31.375
Dad. What's wrong with me?

1117
01:31:32.375 --> 01:31:33.541
Why am I bleeding?

1118
01:31:40.166 --> 01:31:43.333
It's okay. It's just a common nosebleed.

1119
01:31:43.416 --> 01:31:46.291
Clean yourself up and lie down.

1120
01:31:47.708 --> 01:31:49.041
Don't tell your mom.

1121
01:31:49.791 --> 01:31:51.041
She'll get worried.

1122
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:52.875
Okay?

1123
01:31:55.916 --> 01:31:59.791
And what did you give her before she left?

1124
01:32:01.541 --> 01:32:02.666
What was it?

1125
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:05.708
<i>I found the voodoo doll</i>

1126
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.375
<i>next to our house.</i>

1127
01:32:09.583 --> 01:32:11.208
<i>According to a psychic,</i>

1128
01:32:12.208 --> 01:32:15.125
<i>it must be thrown away as far as possible.</i>

1129
01:32:15.833 --> 01:32:17.625
So you told Ita to do it?

1130
01:32:18.125 --> 01:32:19.166
Right?

1131
01:32:23.916 --> 01:32:25.833
What kind of a parent are you?

1132
01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:29.375
I did this for you,

1133
01:32:30.708 --> 01:32:32.291
for my business,

1134
01:32:32.375 --> 01:32:33.333
and for Ita!

1135
01:32:33.416 --> 01:32:35.625
Ita is gone!

1136
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Dear...

1137
01:32:37.083 --> 01:32:40.583
I'd rather die than sacrifice my own child!

1138
01:32:41.416 --> 01:32:43.458
Ita died because of you!

1139
01:32:44.833 --> 01:32:47.583
Ita did nothing wrong!

1140
01:32:48.125 --> 01:32:49.666
Dear.

1141
01:32:58.958 --> 01:33:02.583
MOUNT GEDE, 2009

1142
01:33:11.291 --> 01:33:14.208
Let's take a break there
before we reach the top.

1143
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.500
- Come on.
- Okay.

1144
01:33:23.625 --> 01:33:25.208
Maya. Come on.

1145
01:33:26.416 --> 01:33:28.375
Go on. I'll be right behind you.

1146
01:33:28.458 --> 01:33:29.666
Oh, okay.

1147
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.708
<i>You'll come back here one day.</i>

1148
01:34:00.666 --> 01:34:02.041
<i>And I'm sure you'll cry.</i>

1149
01:34:03.875 --> 01:34:04.916
You were right, Ita.

1150
01:34:10.041 --> 01:34:11.500
I'm back here...

1151
01:34:15.291 --> 01:34:16.625
and I'm crying.

1152
01:34:23.916 --> 01:34:26.000
I miss you so much.

1153
01:34:37.583 --> 01:34:38.666
<i>Maya.</i>

1154
01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:41.458
<i>Maya.</i>

1155
01:35:43.166 --> 01:35:48.333
IN MEMORY OF ITA/PRAMITHA

1156
01:35:50.208 --> 01:35:53.250
If you wish to hike up a mountain,

1157
01:35:53.333 --> 01:35:58.333
remember to watch your words,
manners, and etiquette.

1158
01:35:58.416 --> 01:36:02.541
Because we live alongside the unseen.

1159
01:36:02.625 --> 01:36:05.750
The haunting could happen anywhere.

1160
01:36:07.333 --> 01:36:09.291
She said, "I think I got my period."

1161
01:36:09.375 --> 01:36:12.500
"I'll change my panties in the toilet."

1162
01:36:18.291 --> 01:36:19.291
She strangled me.

1163
01:36:19.375 --> 01:36:21.375
There was a lady,
but she wasn't wearing clothes.

1164
01:36:21.458 --> 01:36:24.583
<i>Leave! You shouldn't be here!</i>

1165
01:36:24.666 --> 01:36:26.250
<i>The Queen is angry!</i>

1166
01:36:26.333 --> 01:36:29.958
She was like a corpse. They were reciting
the call to prayer in her ear.

1167
01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:39.041
"I think I've left something behind."

1168
01:36:39.666 --> 01:36:40.916
What did you leave behind?

1169
01:36:44.166 --> 01:36:45.541
I'm not sure what it is.

1170
01:36:46.208 --> 01:36:47.958
I feel like we're one person short.

1171
01:36:48.583 --> 01:36:49.708
"Don't lie to me."

1172
01:36:49.791 --> 01:36:52.583
<i>"I saw someone washing their feet."</i>

1173
01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.125
What is it, Mom?

1174
01:36:58.625 --> 01:37:01.125
Then who was it I saw back there?

1175
01:37:02.041 --> 01:37:04.750
"There's no demon that can kill a human."

1176
01:37:04.833 --> 01:37:08.041
She glared and then she pulled
her fingernail like...

1177
01:37:08.125 --> 01:37:09.291
It was so...

1178
01:37:09.375 --> 01:37:11.958
- Ita!
- Ita!

1179
01:37:12.541 --> 01:37:14.291
I was very traumatized.

1180
01:37:14.375 --> 01:37:18.000
On the fourth day at the hospital,
her belly kept getting bigger and bigger.

1181
01:37:24.916 --> 01:37:28.625
When she was dying,
she was coughing up blood.

1182
01:37:31.583 --> 01:37:35.125

01:37:42.875 --> 01:37:47.250
"If I die, will you still be my best friend?"

01:37:47.875 --> 01:37:50.416
No matter what happens,
will you still be my best friend?

1186
01:37:51.125 --> 01:37:52.166
Yes, Ita.

1187
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:57.166
I'll always be your best friend.
