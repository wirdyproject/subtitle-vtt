00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.541
-Why did we bring these?
-Come in. Put it there.

2
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.875
Here.

3
00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.041
Please be careful.

4
00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:02.625
-What about this?
-There.

5
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.958
Why did we bring this?

6
00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:07.500
Huda brought that.

7
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.958
-Honey?
-Yes?

8
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.166
Did you buy a rocking chair?

9
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.416
Yes. You said you wanted
to live with me until we're old.

10
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.041
Honey, please stop.

11
00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:25.625
We're not going to be old anytime soon.

12
00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:29.875
Starting today…

13
00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:34.250
this rocking chair becomes our witness.

14
00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:41.708
It's where we share our stories
until we're not here anymore.

15
00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:07.208
What's wrong, honey?

16
00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:12.625
Nothing.

17
00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.291
I'm just a bit tired.

18
00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:20.500
Tired already?

19
00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:21.833
That's unlike you.

20
00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:25.000
Let me get you a drink.

21
00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:26.375
Thank you.

22
00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:35.250
Is it true…

23
00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.375
what you told me?

24
00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:41.083
That if I die first,

25
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.791
you'll never remarry?

26
00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:47.000
That's if you die first.

27
00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:49.875
What if I die first?

28
00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:53.083
You'll definitely remarry.

29
00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:55.125
Of course I won't.

30
00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.458
Relax.

31
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:59.041
I'm certain I'll die first.

32
00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:01.083
-No, me first.
-Me first.

33
00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:02.791
-Me first.
-Me first.

34
00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:08.875
I can't imagine living without you.

35
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:12.833
I wouldn't be able to.

36
00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:33.916
What's wrong, honey?

37
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.583
Honey? Ronald?

38
00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:41.541
What's wrong? Honey? Ronald!
Hey, wake up, Ronald!

39
00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:43.541
Honey, wake up!

40
00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.166
Honey!

41
00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:49.958
Why so worried?

42
00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:52.666
-You really love me?
-What are you doing?

43
00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.625
I'm only kidding, honey. Relax.

44
00:03:56.708 --> 00:03:57.875
It's not funny!

45
00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:00.791
Never do that to me again!

46
00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:03.708
-I'm kidding. Hey!
-I don't like it.

47
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:05.916
Hey! Honey!

48
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.333
Ma'am, you've been six months…

49
00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:14.416
Ronald, you're going to resign?

50
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.916
If God's willing, yes.

51
00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:19.708
I can't stand working here anymore.

52
00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:22.291
It disturbs me.

53
00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:23.625
Think about it again.

54
00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:26.291
You have a daughter.
You still need money for…

55
00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:33.000
Look at this.

56
00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:37.208
Declining for six months.
Bad success rate of debt collection.

57
00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:39.291
What are you even doing here?

58
00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:41.666
Why didn't you collect even harder?

59
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.083
Where's your team? Everyone is soft!

60
00:04:45.916 --> 00:04:47.875
I told you many times, sir.

61
00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.333
We have a new law about debt collection--

62
00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:52.416
You always have excuses.

63
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.500
Management gave you time.

64
00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:57.416
As per our agreement,
write a resignation letter,

65
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.291
and put it on my desk by tomorrow!

66
00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:00.541
Why wait?

67
00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:04.416
I'm leaving now. Excuse me.

68
00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:17.708
I notice…

69
00:05:19.458 --> 00:05:21.250
you look calm.

70
00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:23.875
Aren't you scared?

71
00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:28.625
Why should I be?

72
00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:35.916
I resigned from my work.

73
00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:40.875
I'm jobless now.

74
00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:45.458
I'm unemployed.

75
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:49.958
Aren't you scared?

76
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.208
Honey.

77
00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:07.541
Do you think…

78
00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:09.916
I'm only with you because of your job?

79
00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:15.416
You're my husband.

80
00:06:17.166 --> 00:06:20.083
It's much more important than your job.

81
00:06:23.458 --> 00:06:24.958
Moreover…

82
00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:27.666
as long as we're together,

83
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.500
what should we be scared of?

84
00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:35.166
You should've told me.

85
00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:39.083
Hold my hand…

86
00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:42.708
and tell me…

87
00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:47.500
"Honey, don't be scared."

88
00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:51.791
"I'm here for you, always."

89
00:06:58.208 --> 00:07:00.041
Keep your spirits up.

90
00:07:01.583 --> 00:07:03.041
Thank you, honey.

91
00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:09.500
The ball falls.

92
00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:14.208
While you're jobless,

93
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:16.833
you can spend your time with Bunga.

94
00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:18.875
You can play with her.

95
00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.125
Fun, right?

96
00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:31.875
Mom, Dad, help! Mom!

97
00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.208
Bunga?

98
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:36.458
Bunga?

99
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:38.500
Bunga!

100
00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:41.458
Bunga!

101
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:43.208
-Oh, God! Bunga!
-Bunga!

102
00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:45.375
Bunga!

103
00:07:45.458 --> 00:07:47.083
Bunga!

104
00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:16.625
Bunga!

105
00:08:16.708 --> 00:08:17.875
Bunga.

106
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.375
Wake up, kid.

107
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.625
Bunga.

108
00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.166
God…

109
00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:27.833
take me instead.

110
00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:30.625
Not my daughter.

111
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.166
Bunga!

112
00:08:43.125 --> 00:08:44.541
-Bunga!
-Bunga!

113
00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:50.833
Bunga! Oh, God!

114
00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:55.625
My darling.

115
00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.416
Bunga!

116
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.333
-Thank God.
-Thank God.

117
00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:13.875
Do you really want to have
a little brother?

118
00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:21.750
What are you going to do
with your little brother?

119
00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:25.875
I want to learn how to swim with him,
so I'm not gonna drown anymore.

120
00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:30.625
Forgive me for not being able to be
the best father for you.

121
00:10:01.083 --> 00:10:02.583
Honey.

122
00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:08.666
It's unlike you to take off your ring.

123
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.375
-Oh, right.
-It's unusual of you.

124
00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:12.875
Sorry.

125
00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.208
Here.

126
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:22.958
Keep it on, okay?

127
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:25.625
Yes, honey. I'm sorry.

128
00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:28.416
It's been hard for us lately, isn't it?

129
00:10:31.541 --> 00:10:33.208
But thank God…

130
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.833
we can get through it together.

131
00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:44.125
Thank you for taking care of me and Bunga.

132
00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:54.916
I can be with you…

133
00:10:57.083 --> 00:10:59.375
every day.

134
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.000
That's God's most beautiful gift…

135
00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:06.416
for me.

136
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.458
Thank God.

137
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.125
Every time I see you…

138
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:25.833
Don't start again.

139
00:11:25.916 --> 00:11:29.000
I don't like your joke. It's not funny.

140
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.958
Honey?

141
00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:40.875
Honey, wake up!

142
00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.041
Honey!

143
00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:47.333
Ronald!

144
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:51.333
Ronald!

145
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:33.125
No!

146
00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:39.958
No!

147
00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:44.666
No!

148
00:15:34.291 --> 00:15:35.291
Kiki!

149
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.083
Oh, God!

150
00:15:39.166 --> 00:15:40.416
Kiki!

151
00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:44.625
Be strong, darling. Be strong.

152
00:15:53.458 --> 00:15:54.916
When will Dad come home?

153
00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.500
He…

154
00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:06.541
Dad's not with us anymore, darling.

155
00:16:07.875 --> 00:16:09.541
Where is he?

156
00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:14.041
But he'll come home to us
one day, right, Mom?

157
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.041
Why are you crying?

158
00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:21.666
Are you sad?

159
00:16:25.291 --> 00:16:27.333
I miss Dad.

160
00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:34.916
I know.

161
00:16:38.708 --> 00:16:40.916
I miss him too.

162
00:16:48.458 --> 00:16:49.625
Bunga…

163
00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:55.125
If you miss your dad…

164
00:16:59.083 --> 00:17:00.750
look at the sky.

165
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:06.416
Up there…

166
00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:10.833
Dad's waiting for us.

167
00:17:11.583 --> 00:17:12.708
In heaven.

168
00:17:20.333 --> 00:17:22.541
He'll always be in your heart.

169
00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:29.083
And I'll always be with you.

170
00:17:36.708 --> 00:17:38.375
Don't be afraid, okay?

171
00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:46.041
I'll always be here.

172
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.125
I understand that
a husband's death is hard for any wife.

173
00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:17.750
But life must go on.

174
00:18:18.208 --> 00:18:19.625
You have to move on.

175
00:18:21.375 --> 00:18:24.416
You just became a manager,
but you've been disappearing.

176
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.750
Sales plummet because
you've been absent for too long.

177
00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:31.041
Forgive me, ma'am.

178
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.458
But you know I'm mourning.

179
00:18:36.791 --> 00:18:38.958
And don't make any drama with me.

180
00:18:39.041 --> 00:18:40.708
If the sales keep plummeting…

181
00:18:41.916 --> 00:18:43.583
there'll be no leniency for you.

182
00:18:56.916 --> 00:18:58.041
Hi, Ki.

183
00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:03.458
I'm worried, you know.

184
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.458
You were absent for so long.

185
00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.083
Are you okay?

186
00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:12.958
Ki, I'm serious.

187
00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:17.416
If you need someone to talk to,
I'm here for you.

188
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.000
Anytime, anywhere. Seriously.

189
00:19:24.166 --> 00:19:25.625
You need this, Ki.

190
00:19:30.166 --> 00:19:34.416
Hot chocolate milk,
made specially by yours truly.

191
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.791
Or next time…

192
00:19:37.458 --> 00:19:40.416
I'll bring you chocolate bar. Okay?

193
00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:46.333
Enjoy your chocolate milk.

194
00:20:05.708 --> 00:20:09.458
-I have 500 million in debt?
-That's right.

195
00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:13.000
We've sent you emails
while we couldn't reach you.

196
00:20:13.083 --> 00:20:15.458
But it's higher than
what I'm supposed to pay.

197
00:20:16.625 --> 00:20:17.958
Why couldn't we reach you?

198
00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:21.166
We were gonna explain it all…

199
00:20:22.666 --> 00:20:27.333
Listen, all Bahala Bank's credits
are transferred to Mara Bank.

200
00:20:27.416 --> 00:20:29.875
We only do a fee adjustment.

201
00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:32.250
And this is your total debt now.

202
00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:35.291
If you have any objections,
you can come to our head office.

203
00:20:37.166 --> 00:20:40.166
No. I won't accept this.

204
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.333
This is cruel. No way!

205
00:20:42.416 --> 00:20:45.083
You're the one who is cruel
for not paying.

206
00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:47.125
Pay at the beginning of next month.

207
00:20:47.208 --> 00:20:51.375
If you don't, you'll bear
the consequences. Got it?

208
00:20:53.541 --> 00:20:54.916
We'll take our leave.

209
00:21:21.583 --> 00:21:24.791
We only do what our company ordered us to.

210
00:21:24.875 --> 00:21:26.250
To take back this car.

211
00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:30.375
All of Mr. Ronald's belongings
have been stored in the box.

212
00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:35.833
We'll take our leave.

213
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.625
Mom, why did they take our car?

214
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:56.625
Bunga.

215
00:21:57.291 --> 00:21:59.958
The car has been returned
to Dad's company.

216
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.666
Let's head in.

217
00:22:19.666 --> 00:22:20.833
Hi, Ki!

218
00:22:24.458 --> 00:22:26.666
You go in first, darling.

219
00:22:30.166 --> 00:22:33.875
Ki, I bet you're confused.

220
00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:37.083
"How does Jefry know my address?"

221
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.125
What are you doing here, Jef?

222
00:22:41.708 --> 00:22:45.291
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by.

223
00:22:45.375 --> 00:22:50.000
Who knows, maybe you'd want to chat.
Or maybe you need someone to talk to.

224
00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:55.375
Oh, right. Here. I brought you chocolate.

225
00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:57.500
I promised I would.

226
00:22:57.583 --> 00:23:01.750
Try it, Ki. Or do you want me
to open it for you?

227
00:23:02.875 --> 00:23:04.000
Let me open it for you.

228
00:23:06.416 --> 00:23:10.375
Seriously, he needs to be taught a lesson.

229
00:23:14.875 --> 00:23:16.375
Let me open it for you.

230
00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:17.916
Hey, honey!

231
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:22.083
Why are you giving chocolate
to another woman?

232
00:23:22.166 --> 00:23:27.041
During our marriage,
you've never given me this much chocolate!

233
00:23:27.125 --> 00:23:29.125
Do you want to mess around with her?

234
00:23:31.708 --> 00:23:36.000
It's true, a homewrecker
always looks calm.

235
00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:38.000
Don't you feel guilty?

236
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.291
A homewrecker?

237
00:23:40.083 --> 00:23:44.125
Hey, listen. You're playing around
with someone's husband.

238
00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:45.500
What do you mean?

239
00:23:46.833 --> 00:23:49.166
You're crazy. You're totally crazy!

240
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.333
You play dumb?

241
00:23:51.416 --> 00:23:54.458
Hey! Why are you wearing a hijab?
Why bother?

242
00:23:54.541 --> 00:23:56.541
-It doesn't suit you!
-Honey.

243
00:23:56.625 --> 00:23:58.250
-Look at your behavior!
-Honey.

244
00:23:58.333 --> 00:23:59.458
What?

245
00:23:59.541 --> 00:24:01.708
Don't make a scene here.
It's embarrassing.

246
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:04.625
Embarrassing? You should be embarrassed!

247
00:24:04.708 --> 00:24:08.958
Let everyone know!
See what kind of woman she is!

248
00:24:10.875 --> 00:24:12.500
Honey!

249
00:24:12.583 --> 00:24:16.875
-Take off this hijab!
-Honey!

250
00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:19.708
Hey! What are you doing to my daughter?

251
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:28.791
Ma'am, do you know
that your daughter is a homewrecker?

252
00:24:28.875 --> 00:24:33.166
A homewrecker?
Don't be disrespectful! Watch your mouth!

253
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:37.750
Leave now! Or else I'll report you
for making a scene in our house!

254
00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:43.041
Even if it is true,
we can talk about it nicely inside.

255
00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:44.333
Leave!

256
00:24:45.625 --> 00:24:48.791
Listen. We're not finished.

257
00:24:51.125 --> 00:24:52.375
Let's go.

258
00:24:58.875 --> 00:25:00.125
Mom.

259
00:25:22.416 --> 00:25:24.833
How dare she makes a move on Mr. Jefry!

260
00:25:24.916 --> 00:25:27.250
She knows he has a wife.

261
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.083
-Right?
-I know, right?

262
00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:35.166
Kiki.

263
00:25:39.666 --> 00:25:43.541
If you really don't have
any relationship with the guy,

264
00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:46.125
don't think about it too much, darling.

265
00:25:47.833 --> 00:25:49.500
How can I not think about it?

266
00:25:50.875 --> 00:25:53.000
People gossip about me at the office.

267
00:25:54.125 --> 00:25:55.666
As if I'm a naughty girl.

268
00:25:56.666 --> 00:25:59.875
If you think too much about
what people say,

269
00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:02.375
it'll only bring you harm.

270
00:26:03.416 --> 00:26:04.583
Okay?

271
00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:09.791
Mom.

272
00:26:09.875 --> 00:26:11.166
Mom.

273
00:26:11.916 --> 00:26:16.041
Mom, look, I put clothes
on my baby brother. Does it look nice?

274
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.041
Mom, look.

275
00:26:20.833 --> 00:26:24.166
Mom, look.

276
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.583
Mom, look.

277
00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:30.541
Mom, look.

278
00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:31.958
Mom!

279
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:36.625
Bunga!

280
00:26:38.291 --> 00:26:40.000
Can you just shut up?

281
00:26:40.083 --> 00:26:42.291
I have a lot of problems right now!

282
00:26:42.375 --> 00:26:45.541
Can you stop whining?

283
00:26:45.625 --> 00:26:46.875
Say God's name.

284
00:26:46.958 --> 00:26:50.125
If you can't shut up,
I'll put you in an orphanage!

285
00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:53.291
Kiki! What are you doing?

286
00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:55.333
What are you doing to Bunga?

287
00:26:55.416 --> 00:26:57.083
Mom, you're cruel!

288
00:26:57.166 --> 00:26:59.000
Kiki, just so you know,

289
00:26:59.083 --> 00:27:02.500
Bunga isn't only your child.
She's also Ronald's child.

290
00:27:02.583 --> 00:27:04.375
Bunga, come with us.

291
00:27:05.083 --> 00:27:07.083
Bunga…

292
00:27:08.166 --> 00:27:09.333
Bunga…

293
00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:18.833
Kiki is unpredictable.

294
00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:21.583
Bunga, darling…

295
00:27:22.916 --> 00:27:25.208
stay with us for a while, okay?

296
00:27:26.375 --> 00:27:28.000
All right, Bunga?

297
00:27:37.083 --> 00:27:38.416
Ki…

298
00:27:39.166 --> 00:27:41.000
One day, you'll understand.

299
00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:45.250
All this happen because
God loves you so much.

300
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.958
I know…

301
00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:52.791
all of this is hard for you.

302
00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.416
But trust me, God is fair.

303
00:28:02.083 --> 00:28:03.750
Sometimes, us humans--

304
00:28:03.833 --> 00:28:05.083
Enough, Mom.

305
00:28:06.833 --> 00:28:08.750
I don't want to be preached at.

306
00:28:11.208 --> 00:28:13.875
Seek forgiveness in God, Ki.

307
00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:15.500
Ask for His forgiveness.

308
00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:20.083
Ask for His forgiveness?

309
00:28:22.416 --> 00:28:25.458
What sin did I do to live
this kind of life?

310
00:28:27.125 --> 00:28:29.583
Ki, we all have our sins.

311
00:28:29.666 --> 00:28:32.125
But other people have more sins than me.

312
00:28:33.208 --> 00:28:37.583
I'm covering my head.
I'm following all of His orders.

313
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.291
God is unfair to me, Mom.

314
00:28:43.375 --> 00:28:45.750
God is unfair to me.

315
00:28:48.958 --> 00:28:51.958
Ronald is dead, Mom.

316
00:28:54.083 --> 00:28:56.333
Bunga is taken away from me.

317
00:28:57.583 --> 00:29:00.250
I have to deal with all of this alone.

318
00:29:03.125 --> 00:29:06.500
God is unfair to me, Mom.

319
00:29:16.458 --> 00:29:19.916
I can't!

320
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.916
I can't live without you! I told you!

321
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.625
Why did you leave me, Ronald?

322
00:30:20.458 --> 00:30:21.750
Yes?

323
00:30:24.416 --> 00:30:26.500
Peace be upon you, Kiki!

324
00:30:26.583 --> 00:30:28.000
Peace be upon you too.

325
00:30:30.541 --> 00:30:32.208
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

326
00:30:37.458 --> 00:30:39.708
You want your life full of miracles?

327
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:43.083
Behold, this product can fulfill
all your needs.

328
00:30:43.166 --> 00:30:46.208
Guaranteed quality for thousands of years!

329
00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:52.416
Thank you.

330
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.833
You're welcome.

331
00:30:56.166 --> 00:30:57.458
What happened to your hand?

332
00:31:03.416 --> 00:31:04.750
Hey…

333
00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:09.208
Back then, when I had a lot of problems,

334
00:31:09.291 --> 00:31:12.291
I loved to blame others.
I blamed them my condition.

335
00:31:12.375 --> 00:31:14.416
I just blamed everything.

336
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:19.375
One day, I had a sore neck
and I blamed the pillow.

337
00:31:19.458 --> 00:31:21.625
They said it was the pillow's fault.

338
00:31:27.125 --> 00:31:29.083
Are you making fun of me?

339
00:31:29.166 --> 00:31:31.916
If you're only looking for trouble,
you better go home.

340
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.750
Who's looking for trouble?

341
00:31:34.833 --> 00:31:38.375
Why would I be here
if I don't care about you?

342
00:31:38.458 --> 00:31:39.833
You don't understand.

343
00:31:41.458 --> 00:31:43.791
You don't know how it feels like to be me.

344
00:31:46.083 --> 00:31:50.458
Since Ronald died,
my life is full of hardships.

345
00:31:50.541 --> 00:31:53.625
That's how life is.
It's full of hardships.

346
00:31:53.708 --> 00:31:55.541
It's not easy, of course.

347
00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:59.583
Accept it, Ki. Life is hard.

348
00:31:59.666 --> 00:32:01.458
I know.

349
00:32:01.541 --> 00:32:03.500
If it was soft, it'd be a pillow.

350
00:32:04.458 --> 00:32:07.375
Just listen to my story.

351
00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:13.166
It's about a demon that saddens
a mother who just lost her child.

352
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.583
The demon makes
the mother cry all the time.

353
00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:19.375
And do you know what the worst part is?

354
00:32:19.458 --> 00:32:22.125
-The demon--
-Can a demon have a child?

355
00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:24.375
-He can.
-He has offspring, then?

356
00:32:24.458 --> 00:32:26.291
-He does.
-How do you know?

357
00:32:26.375 --> 00:32:29.500
-It's in the Qur'an.
-He has a wife, then?

358
00:32:29.583 --> 00:32:33.166
Yes. To have a child, there needs
to be a wife and a husband.

359
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.083
Did you ask what his wife's name is?

360
00:32:37.166 --> 00:32:42.791
Sorry, but you're funny. How would I know?
I didn't go to their wedding.

361
00:32:50.125 --> 00:32:53.000
It's been a while since
I laughed like this.

362
00:32:54.833 --> 00:32:56.250
Thank you.

363
00:32:59.625 --> 00:33:02.416
Laughter is indeed a medicine for me.

364
00:33:04.291 --> 00:33:05.791
Thank God, Ki.

365
00:33:05.875 --> 00:33:10.541
It's nice to see you laugh. I'm happy
to see you laugh for obvious reasons.

366
00:33:10.625 --> 00:33:12.458
If not, then I'm scared for you.

367
00:33:12.541 --> 00:33:14.416
You really need medication, then.

368
00:33:18.125 --> 00:33:20.541
You don't seem like you have any problems.

369
00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:23.458
No problem?

370
00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:26.125
Well, I don't have problems anymore.

371
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.458
Really?

372
00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:31.875
Yes, I have issues now.

373
00:33:33.458 --> 00:33:34.583
What's the difference?

374
00:33:34.666 --> 00:33:37.125
Hey, they're different, Ki.

375
00:33:37.208 --> 00:33:39.333
They have different energies.

376
00:33:39.416 --> 00:33:43.250
Why? Problems are
synonymous with complaints.

377
00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:47.125
While an issue always has an answer.

378
00:33:47.208 --> 00:33:52.708
So, by changing the word "problem"
with "issue", you'd get answers easier.

379
00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.166
You have a good point.

380
00:33:58.791 --> 00:34:00.625
Why are you so mature now, Ma?

381
00:34:01.708 --> 00:34:03.750
Different from the old Rahma.

382
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:08.708
You used to be angry a lot.

383
00:34:08.791 --> 00:34:12.916
You gossiped a lot.
You were so negative towards people.

384
00:34:14.208 --> 00:34:15.958
You're wiser now.

385
00:34:19.291 --> 00:34:23.375
You haven't told me
why you started wearing a hijab.

386
00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:26.958
It's a very long hijab.

387
00:34:28.958 --> 00:34:30.625
You wanna know the story?

388
00:34:36.791 --> 00:34:38.958
God is envious.

389
00:34:39.041 --> 00:34:41.708
Love for anyone,

390
00:34:41.791 --> 00:34:45.958
for our kids, our parents,
our husbands, or our wives…

391
00:34:46.041 --> 00:34:50.541
It can be a test if it exceeds
your love for God.

392
00:34:50.625 --> 00:34:57.166
Don't let that love blind our hearts
to our love to God.

393
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.583
So you changed because of an ustad?

394
00:35:06.083 --> 00:35:07.750
Not because of the ustad.

395
00:35:07.833 --> 00:35:10.041
The ustad gave his knowledge to me.

396
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.041
And I practice the knowledge.

397
00:35:13.125 --> 00:35:15.125
Thank God, I changed.

398
00:35:15.208 --> 00:35:17.458
But it's all with God's permission.

399
00:35:20.916 --> 00:35:22.750
I'm not gonna be involved in that.

400
00:35:25.083 --> 00:35:26.625
Ki, listen.

401
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:30.250
I think, with Ronald's death…

402
00:35:30.333 --> 00:35:34.375
That's the sign
God will give you a miracle.

403
00:35:34.458 --> 00:35:36.208
A miracle.

404
00:35:36.291 --> 00:35:39.875
The important thing I need to
think about now is my mortgage.

405
00:35:39.958 --> 00:35:43.500
How to pay for Bunga's school.

406
00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:45.791
And the most important…

407
00:35:45.875 --> 00:35:49.458
I have to be able to live without Ronald.

408
00:35:49.541 --> 00:35:53.666
Well, that's a lot of wishes.
As much as your dirty laundry.

409
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.458
And you want all that to come true?

410
00:35:55.541 --> 00:35:57.083
Of course.

411
00:35:57.166 --> 00:36:00.708
You have to focus on
improving yourself, then.

412
00:36:01.416 --> 00:36:03.000
Am I not good now?

413
00:36:03.083 --> 00:36:05.416
That's now what I mean.

414
00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.375
Why are you so sensitive?

415
00:36:07.458 --> 00:36:12.041
Listen, Ustad Nas told me something.
This is what he said.

416
00:36:12.125 --> 00:36:14.666
"Improve your relationship with God,

417
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.291
and God will improve
your quality of life."

418
00:36:17.958 --> 00:36:20.625
So, what do you say?
Will you come with me to Ustad Nas?

419
00:36:20.708 --> 00:36:23.583
No. I don't want to be preached at.

420
00:36:23.666 --> 00:36:26.458
I just want my life to be happy.

421
00:36:26.541 --> 00:36:29.333
Okay. You want your life to be happy…

422
00:36:30.416 --> 00:36:31.750
or peaceful?

423
00:36:52.583 --> 00:36:53.916
We're here.

424
00:36:54.666 --> 00:36:55.833
Come on.

425
00:36:56.541 --> 00:36:57.916
Let me stay here.

426
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.291
I'll wait in the car.
I'm not coming with you.

427
00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:02.125
Why?

428
00:37:02.208 --> 00:37:05.875
I told Ustad Nas
that I'm bringing a friend.

429
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.041
Come on!

430
00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:10.375
Stop, don't force me.

431
00:37:10.458 --> 00:37:12.666
Just go, I'll wait here.

432
00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:16.000
Okay, then. I'll leave.

433
00:37:17.083 --> 00:37:19.708
But we go for meatballs afterwards, okay?

434
00:37:21.583 --> 00:37:23.791
Okay. Bye.

435
00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:35.291
One way to get a miracle

436
00:37:35.375 --> 00:37:40.208
is by accepting all of God's decisions
with an open heart.

437
00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:47.125
There's a story of a woman in
our Prophet's time who lost her husband.

438
00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:48.750
Her husband died.

439
00:37:49.791 --> 00:37:55.583
After the funeral, the woman was still sad
and kept stroking her husband's tomb.

440
00:37:55.666 --> 00:37:59.875
The Prophet passed behind her and said,
"Be patient."

441
00:38:00.875 --> 00:38:04.250
The woman, without turning her head, said,

442
00:38:04.333 --> 00:38:08.208
"Don't tell me what to do.
You don't know how I feel."

443
00:38:08.291 --> 00:38:13.208
Oh, God.
But the Prophet passed behind her.

444
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:15.333
He let her be, because she was mourning.

445
00:38:15.416 --> 00:38:18.250
Her friend told her,
"That was the Prophet."

446
00:38:18.333 --> 00:38:21.125
"Oh, God. That was the Prophet?"
"Yes, that was him."

447
00:38:21.208 --> 00:38:26.708
Her mourning vanished because her love
for the Prophet exceeded everything.

448
00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:31.000
She ran to the Prophet's house.
"Peace be upon you, Prophet."

449
00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:33.750
"It was me whose husband was buried."

450
00:38:33.833 --> 00:38:36.541
"Forgive me for
not listening to your counsel."

451
00:38:36.625 --> 00:38:41.666
The Prophet calmly responded, "It's okay."
That was how the Prophet was.

452
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:45.416
Very polite and caring
towards his followers.

453
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:51.250
But after that, the Prophet gave
soul-trembling advice.

454
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.875
"Have patience on the first pound."

455
00:38:58.875 --> 00:39:01.208
What he meant…

456
00:39:01.291 --> 00:39:06.333
was have patience
the second misfortune happens.

457
00:39:07.166 --> 00:39:08.666
We are humans.

458
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.416
But humans can be greater than angels.

459
00:39:13.291 --> 00:39:15.875
Because humans are able to control
their feelings.

460
00:39:15.958 --> 00:39:19.541
Their confusion, their sadness,
their disappointment.

461
00:39:19.625 --> 00:39:24.083
Religion teaches us to control
all of these feelings…

462
00:39:25.208 --> 00:39:29.250
for us to have miracles.

463
00:39:34.958 --> 00:39:37.458
So, who wants to have miracles here?

464
00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:38.958
Me!

465
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:44.125
But we have to accept our misfortune
with an open heart.

466
00:39:44.208 --> 00:39:45.500
Repeat after me.

467
00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:48.875
We have to accept our misfortune
with an open heart.

468
00:39:48.958 --> 00:39:50.458
Thank God.

469
00:39:51.708 --> 00:39:53.583
It's okay to cry.

470
00:39:53.666 --> 00:39:56.791
Women are given a gift by God.

471
00:39:56.875 --> 00:39:59.708
They have more tears than men.

472
00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:06.125
God has a purpose and a meaning for that,
that is for women to be strong.

473
00:40:06.208 --> 00:40:08.958
The philosophy is that
tears are like water.

474
00:40:09.458 --> 00:40:12.583
Purifying, cleansing.

475
00:40:12.666 --> 00:40:15.666
Sweeping away all confusion.

476
00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:21.125
Tears are also God's summons
of love to women.

477
00:40:22.791 --> 00:40:29.000
As long as you let the tears fall
to make yourself closer to God.

478
00:40:30.208 --> 00:40:33.333
How do we get closer to God?

479
00:40:34.583 --> 00:40:38.458
First, repent and improve yourself.

480
00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:43.875
As humans, we have to dare
acknowledging our faults and sins.

481
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.875
Even I have a lot of sins.

482
00:40:48.666 --> 00:40:52.583
But with our courage to acknowledge
our faults and sins…

483
00:40:52.666 --> 00:40:56.583
God will open a door,
the door of repentance.

484
00:40:57.083 --> 00:41:01.916
With that door,
God will forgive our every mistake.

485
00:41:02.625 --> 00:41:07.458
Giving us solutions, giving us miracles.

486
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.458
And put out
all of his painful punishments.

487
00:41:14.916 --> 00:41:19.041
Will God forgive all of my sins, Ustad?

488
00:41:21.083 --> 00:41:25.083
God is never tired of forgiving
His followers

489
00:41:25.833 --> 00:41:27.750
who truly repent.

490
00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:33.375
He opens the door of his mercy
with istighfar and repent prayer.

491
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.541
By always doing these two things,

492
00:41:37.625 --> 00:41:42.791
let's hope God will forgive our sins
and improve our lives.

493
00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:17.958
What's wrong with you?

494
00:42:18.041 --> 00:42:20.166
Why can't you stop looking
at the calendar?

495
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:24.000
You better look at me instead.
You'll get more positive vibes.

496
00:42:26.041 --> 00:42:26.916
What?

497
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:29.375
Do I look that cool?

498
00:42:34.958 --> 00:42:37.583
I'm only waiting for a miracle, you know.

499
00:42:37.666 --> 00:42:39.500
That's it. That's good.

500
00:42:39.583 --> 00:42:41.125
I've done repent prayers.

501
00:42:41.833 --> 00:42:43.541
I said a lot of istighfars.

502
00:42:45.291 --> 00:42:48.166
But where's my miracle?
It's not coming my way.

503
00:42:48.791 --> 00:42:52.333
Ki, try changing your intention.

504
00:42:52.416 --> 00:42:55.916
Intention determines
how far we survive and go.

505
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.791
Be patient! It's only been a few days
and you stopped believing already?

506
00:42:59.875 --> 00:43:01.583
It's not that I stopped believing.

507
00:43:02.375 --> 00:43:04.541
But there's not even a sign it's coming.

508
00:43:04.625 --> 00:43:08.041
Why would the miracle come
if you're being impatient?

509
00:43:08.958 --> 00:43:11.083
How long should I be patient?

510
00:43:11.166 --> 00:43:14.083
Just be patient! Until…

511
00:43:15.083 --> 00:43:18.375
Until your nose gets bigger. That's it.

512
00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:21.500
What are you talking about?

513
00:43:22.458 --> 00:43:23.958
I'm serious, you know.

514
00:43:24.833 --> 00:43:26.125
Being patient is hard.

515
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.541
I know.

516
00:43:28.625 --> 00:43:33.291
But if you do it with sincerity,
nothing is hard.

517
00:43:33.375 --> 00:43:34.958
You have to be steadfast.

518
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:37.666
Steadfastness is also hard.

519
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:41.083
It's hard. Who said it would be easy?

520
00:43:41.166 --> 00:43:43.583
Do you know what's easy?

521
00:43:43.666 --> 00:43:45.250
Do you know what?

522
00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:50.208
-Breakfast.
-Stop it, Rahma!

523
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.791
Okay, Ki, stop being like that.

524
00:43:57.875 --> 00:44:00.000
You better pray a lot.

525
00:44:00.583 --> 00:44:04.208
Don't let your prayers sink
in desperation.

526
00:44:04.291 --> 00:44:06.958
Only meatballs should sink in their broth.

527
00:44:12.666 --> 00:44:18.375
I am so sorry for making a scene
in my husband's office.

528
00:44:19.291 --> 00:44:23.625
I didn't think it would be
this big of a problem.

529
00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:28.666
I only sent the video
to one of his friends.

530
00:44:31.041 --> 00:44:35.333
-That's right, who sent--
-Mr. Jefry!

531
00:44:35.416 --> 00:44:37.125
Let me remind you once again.

532
00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:40.500
Stop it. Don't make the problem bigger.

533
00:44:40.583 --> 00:44:42.041
Don't prolong this.

534
00:44:42.125 --> 00:44:44.458
Why don't we focus on

535
00:44:44.541 --> 00:44:49.583
how people thought of Ms. Kiki
as a homewrecker?

536
00:44:49.666 --> 00:44:52.458
And we already know the answer.

537
00:44:52.541 --> 00:44:55.375
That it's only a misunderstanding.
Right, Ms. Luna?

538
00:44:56.708 --> 00:44:57.708
Right?

539
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:00.708
Ms. Kiki…

540
00:45:02.083 --> 00:45:04.000
I also want to apologize.

541
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:10.416
My reckless action
sullied your reputation.

542
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.833
The actual cause is…

543
00:45:13.916 --> 00:45:20.208
our family's unsolved internal problem.

544
00:45:23.166 --> 00:45:27.625
To be honest, I often think negatively
about my husband.

545
00:45:29.625 --> 00:45:31.458
Forgive me, Ms. Kiki.

546
00:45:31.541 --> 00:45:32.875
I'm truly sorry.

547
00:45:35.083 --> 00:45:39.041
Mr. Jefry, next time you go to
Ms. Kiki's house,

548
00:45:39.125 --> 00:45:43.041
or the house of anyone
of the opposite sex,

549
00:45:43.125 --> 00:45:44.875
just be honest with your wife.

550
00:45:44.958 --> 00:45:50.291
Tell her first. As the longest-working
HR member in this company,

551
00:45:50.375 --> 00:45:53.375
I can only say this to you and Ms. Luna.

552
00:45:53.458 --> 00:45:58.625
There are three things
that are hated the most by a couple.

553
00:45:58.708 --> 00:46:03.208
The first one is an empty brain.

554
00:46:03.291 --> 00:46:05.625
Secondly, empty words.

555
00:46:05.708 --> 00:46:09.500
And the third one is an empty wallet.

556
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.750
If you ever experience that,

557
00:46:13.833 --> 00:46:18.416
remember Pasha Ungu's song.

558
00:46:19.916 --> 00:46:25.625
Have you ever felt that
Your wallet's empty?

559
00:46:27.583 --> 00:46:29.833
-So--
-I know what you're going to say.

560
00:46:29.916 --> 00:46:31.833
You don't need to worry.

561
00:46:31.916 --> 00:46:34.166
I'll fulfill my obligation.

562
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:37.500
And I know you come here to do your job.

563
00:46:37.583 --> 00:46:39.541
But trust me, please.

564
00:46:39.625 --> 00:46:44.458
I won't go anywhere, I'll stay here,
and you can come anytime.

565
00:46:44.541 --> 00:46:49.708
And I'll come to your office to meet
your superior and finish our business.

566
00:46:50.708 --> 00:46:52.625
I think everything's clear.

567
00:46:52.708 --> 00:46:54.375
You can go now.

568
00:46:59.916 --> 00:47:01.625
Just relax.

569
00:47:01.708 --> 00:47:06.500
If your intention isn't fulfilled today,
just relax. Don't be disappointed.

570
00:47:06.583 --> 00:47:08.458
Don't be discouraged to come again.

571
00:47:08.541 --> 00:47:10.208
There'll still be tomorrow.

572
00:47:10.291 --> 00:47:13.750
And you have to believe. That tomorrow is…

573
00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:32.333
It's been months since your husband died,
but you still can't focus?

574
00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:37.583
Why don't you find another husband
so you can focus on your job?

575
00:47:39.541 --> 00:47:41.291
Why are you saying that?

576
00:47:41.375 --> 00:47:43.666
The sales fall to the bottom.

577
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.291
And I can't say that?

578
00:47:46.583 --> 00:47:48.166
I can say anything

579
00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.958
if your personal matter disturbs
the company.

580
00:47:51.916 --> 00:47:54.666
I see you changing lately.

581
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:57.458
But your change
doesn't benefit the company.

582
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.041
And you're being picky.

583
00:48:00.125 --> 00:48:02.750
Refused to meet clients
at bars and lounges.

584
00:48:03.125 --> 00:48:04.791
It's not that I don't want to.

585
00:48:04.875 --> 00:48:07.125
But there's no rule in this company

586
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:10.083
that requires me to meet clients
at a bar or a lounge.

587
00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:12.541
Why are you defending yourself?

588
00:48:12.625 --> 00:48:14.875
Instead of admitting your fault.

589
00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:16.250
You have no shame!

590
00:48:16.333 --> 00:48:18.125
I can explain everything, ma'am.

591
00:48:18.208 --> 00:48:20.000
I don't need your explanation.

592
00:48:20.083 --> 00:48:22.375
As I told you…

593
00:48:22.458 --> 00:48:25.833
If you don't make any progress,
find another job.

594
00:48:25.916 --> 00:48:29.083
Please, listen to me, ma'am.
I can explain everything, ma'am.

595
00:48:29.166 --> 00:48:30.458
I don't care.

596
00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:34.291
Whether you stay single
or get a new husband,

597
00:48:34.375 --> 00:48:37.000
you better find another job elsewhere.

598
00:48:49.416 --> 00:48:51.791
TERMINATION LETTER

599
00:49:00.208 --> 00:49:01.500
I'll take my leave.

600
00:49:20.625 --> 00:49:21.916
Mom!

601
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.166
Mom!

602
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.708
Mom!

603
00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:31.791
Darling!

604
00:49:33.125 --> 00:49:35.458
Bunga.

605
00:49:35.541 --> 00:49:37.000
Oh, God.

606
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.833
Bunga.

607
00:49:42.875 --> 00:49:47.000
Mom. Why did you never come visit?

608
00:49:48.041 --> 00:49:49.791
I miss you.

609
00:49:51.125 --> 00:49:53.208
I miss you more, Bunga.

610
00:49:54.083 --> 00:49:55.875
Forgive me, darling.

611
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.666
I don't have any friends here.

612
00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.416
You have me, darling.

613
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.000
I'm here for you. Okay?

614
00:50:17.958 --> 00:50:21.541
Oh, God. I miss you so much.

615
00:50:21.625 --> 00:50:26.250
Sorry, Ms. Kiki. You better leave.

616
00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:28.125
Her grandparents will be here soon.

617
00:50:30.625 --> 00:50:33.708
Bibi, I only just arrived just.

618
00:50:33.791 --> 00:50:35.708
Why do you ask me to leave?

619
00:50:37.208 --> 00:50:38.875
But what should I do?

620
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.708
I'm afraid of being scolded.

621
00:50:42.791 --> 00:50:46.000
They can kick me out of the house.

622
00:50:46.083 --> 00:50:50.875
They told me to not let anyone see Bunga.

623
00:50:50.958 --> 00:50:52.250
Especially you.

624
00:51:01.583 --> 00:51:02.750
Darling.

625
00:51:04.416 --> 00:51:05.875
I'm sorry.

626
00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:09.458
I have to leave now.

627
00:51:09.541 --> 00:51:13.125
No! If you leave, I'm coming with you.

628
00:51:14.625 --> 00:51:18.500
I'll pick you up. Okay?

629
00:51:18.583 --> 00:51:21.958
Don't cry. Don't be sad. Okay?

630
00:51:22.041 --> 00:51:23.750
I promise you.

631
00:51:23.833 --> 00:51:28.750
I'll come back here to pick you up. Okay?

632
00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:30.791
Okay, darling?

633
00:51:35.041 --> 00:51:36.291
Ki.

634
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:41.291
Why did you threaten
to bring this case to court?

635
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:48.166
You better bring them to a Qur'an study.
You'll get rewards for that.

636
00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:49.666
It's better than this.

637
00:51:50.833 --> 00:51:55.041
At least if you don't get rewards,
you'll get food. Here, some fritters.

638
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:57.958
I don't get you.

639
00:51:59.083 --> 00:52:00.625
You have a lot of problems.

640
00:52:00.708 --> 00:52:03.500
Yet you add another one.

641
00:52:03.583 --> 00:52:04.958
Am I wrong?

642
00:52:06.916 --> 00:52:08.875
Am I wrong to live with my daughter?

643
00:52:10.416 --> 00:52:14.458
You know I don't have anyone anymore.

644
00:52:14.541 --> 00:52:16.416
Ronald isn't here anymore.

645
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.166
Bunga is not with me.

646
00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.166
You still have God.

647
00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:21.916
Do you forget?

648
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.791
Be patient, Ki.

649
00:52:25.291 --> 00:52:27.041
You keep telling me to be patient.

650
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.416
You can only give me advices.

651
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.291
Try being me. How would you fare?

652
00:52:33.375 --> 00:52:36.208
Do you forget?
"Have patience on the first pound."

653
00:52:37.208 --> 00:52:38.250
Until when?

654
00:52:38.333 --> 00:52:40.500
Until you get your miracle.

655
00:52:43.083 --> 00:52:44.083
Here.

656
00:52:50.791 --> 00:52:51.875
Look.

657
00:52:53.208 --> 00:52:57.583
Whatever the Qur'an came to,
it became glorious.

658
00:52:57.666 --> 00:53:04.666
The Qur'an came to the most glorious
human, Prophet Muhammad SAW.

659
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:10.750
The angel that brought the Qur'an
became the most glorious angel, Jibril AS.

660
00:53:10.833 --> 00:53:13.708
The places that the Qur'an came to became

661
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:16.666
the most glorious places,
Makkah and Madinah.

662
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:22.750
The night the Qur'an came became
the most glorious night, Laylat-ul-Qadr.

663
00:53:22.833 --> 00:53:27.375
So, bring all your problems to the Qur'an.

664
00:53:27.458 --> 00:53:32.875
If God's willing, there will be a way out
and you will get a miracle.

665
00:53:36.958 --> 00:53:41.708
You wanna know why I changed like this?

666
00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:28.500
One day…

667
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.833
a baby girl…

668
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:38.833
was brought to the supermarket
by her parents.

669
00:54:41.583 --> 00:54:47.666
Her parents were busy putting
their groceries into the car.

670
00:54:52.833 --> 00:54:53.958
And…

671
00:54:56.083 --> 00:55:00.208
suddenly, the stroller rolled down.

672
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.666
And at the same time…

673
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:38.791
That mother was me, Ki.

674
00:55:41.541 --> 00:55:47.333
The mother who lost her baby girl… was me.

675
00:55:53.833 --> 00:55:55.291
For years…

676
00:55:57.625 --> 00:56:00.208
I couldn't come into this room.

677
00:56:02.083 --> 00:56:04.291
I was crushed.

678
00:56:05.833 --> 00:56:10.583
I felt like life wasn't fair.

679
00:56:10.666 --> 00:56:12.625
It was suffocating.

680
00:56:20.833 --> 00:56:22.375
But after

681
00:56:24.208 --> 00:56:27.041
I learned about Qur'an vibration
from Ustad Nas…

682
00:56:28.666 --> 00:56:32.625
with God's permission, I found peace.

683
00:56:34.875 --> 00:56:36.583
It was hard at first.

684
00:56:37.833 --> 00:56:39.333
Really hard.

685
00:56:41.833 --> 00:56:45.125
But I learned that

686
00:56:46.166 --> 00:56:49.083
a misfortune is a door to blessings.

687
00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.250
Miracles come…

688
00:56:57.375 --> 00:56:59.875
when we find peace.

689
00:57:10.958 --> 00:57:12.541
And it's true…

690
00:57:15.291 --> 00:57:17.000
that God's plan

691
00:57:18.416 --> 00:57:21.625
is always more beautiful than man's plan.

692
00:57:26.416 --> 00:57:29.250
God replaced Asha with Fatimah.

693
00:57:30.916 --> 00:57:32.333
He replaced her.

694
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.375
THE SECRET OF WEALTH MAGNET

695
00:58:20.458 --> 00:58:22.375
AL-QUR'AN

696
00:58:48.541 --> 00:58:53.333
Whenever He wills a thing…

697
00:58:53.416 --> 00:58:58.208
He just commands it to be and it is.

698
00:59:00.875 --> 00:59:02.916
This is called tadabbur.

699
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.666
Tadabbur of the Qur'an can be a cure

700
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:10.416
to our hurt feelings.

701
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:14.375
A cure for our burden,
so we can have a release.

702
00:59:15.541 --> 00:59:18.791
To hope to humans, it's gonna be empty.

703
00:59:18.875 --> 00:59:21.958
To hope to things, it's gonna vanish.

704
00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:25.333
To hope to power, it's gonna disappear.

705
00:59:25.416 --> 00:59:29.833
Hope to God who never wastes hope.

706
00:59:34.625 --> 00:59:38.041
Sometimes, when we have problems and
we open the Qur'an,

707
00:59:38.125 --> 00:59:44.208
when we open it randomly,
the surah is matching what we feel.

708
00:59:44.291 --> 00:59:45.666
It can be like that.

709
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:47.541
And it's only the Qur'an.

710
00:59:47.625 --> 00:59:52.916
You can open and read anything.
But there's nothing like the Qur'an.

711
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.666
Because even when you open it
and haven't read it,

712
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:58.416
you've felt the vibration of your soul.

713
00:59:59.875 --> 01:00:03.291
"Okay, then." Ayyub AS went.

714
01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:05.125
And the Satan teased him.

715
01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:08.000
"Hey, Yub. Why do you that?"

716
01:00:08.083 --> 01:00:10.916
"Your belongings are taken.
Your kid is taken."

717
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.875
"And now you're sick. You're kicked out."

718
01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:15.541
And what says Ayub?

719
01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:20.708
"Thank God, I was once close to them."

720
01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:28.375
To God we belong and to Him we return.

721
01:00:59.666 --> 01:01:02.375
Thanks.

722
01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:03.875
You don't need to bother.

723
01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:05.791
Relax.

724
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.291
Thank you, Ki.

725
01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:09.375
In the name of God.

726
01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:22.000
Why are you looking at me like that?

727
01:01:22.083 --> 01:01:24.083
You look different.

728
01:01:24.166 --> 01:01:25.708
Different?

729
01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:29.583
How do I explain it? You shine.

730
01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:33.041
I'm not a lamp.

731
01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:37.208
That's not what I meant.
I mean, your face is glowing.

732
01:01:37.291 --> 01:01:39.708
Are you using new skincare products?

733
01:01:39.791 --> 01:01:44.708
No way. When do I have the time
for skincare?

734
01:01:44.791 --> 01:01:50.875
All I think about now is,
how do I solve all of my problems?

735
01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:55.958
Hold on.
I know why your face is glowing like this.

736
01:01:56.041 --> 01:01:58.208
You've found the verse.

737
01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:01.833
You're friends with the Qur'an now.

738
01:02:01.916 --> 01:02:03.000
Right?

739
01:02:03.083 --> 01:02:06.500
My friend. Oh, God. That's great.

740
01:02:09.166 --> 01:02:11.041
That's good. I like it.

741
01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:17.208
-Who is that?
-Hang on.

742
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:27.500
This house is foreclosed?
There must be a misunderstanding.

743
01:02:27.583 --> 01:02:31.000
There's no misunderstanding.
The process has been dragging on.

744
01:02:31.083 --> 01:02:35.250
Now it has entered
the payment restructuring phase.

745
01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:37.708
You never pay anymore.

746
01:02:37.791 --> 01:02:42.708
It's written clearly there.
Pay or I'd foreclose on the house.

747
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:49.208
Look, if anyone's
misunderstanding here, it's you.

748
01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:52.166
Why are you all here anyway?

749
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:54.375
Ms. Kiki already knows her obligation.

750
01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:58.375
She came to your office.
So why do you do this all of a sudden?

751
01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:02.125
Right. I came to your office
to do renegotiate with your superior.

752
01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:04.083
Why do you have to foreclose?

753
01:03:04.166 --> 01:03:06.958
You can make any excuses.

754
01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:10.041
We're only here to give you the letter.

755
01:03:10.125 --> 01:03:13.250
We'll give you a week to empty the house.

756
01:03:13.333 --> 01:03:14.916
Wait.

757
01:03:17.708 --> 01:03:19.833
What's going on there?

758
01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:21.541
Let's get out.

759
01:03:21.625 --> 01:03:23.041
-Let's go, sir.
-Yes.

760
01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:26.375
I'm going to ask for legal aid, then.

761
01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:28.250
You can go to the police.

762
01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:31.208
If they think we're breaking the law,
we'll deal with it.

763
01:03:31.291 --> 01:03:32.666
Okay, then.

764
01:03:37.833 --> 01:03:39.166
What's going on here?

765
01:03:40.208 --> 01:03:43.333
You're making a scene
at a resident's house.

766
01:03:44.416 --> 01:03:45.958
Kiki?

767
01:03:46.041 --> 01:03:47.125
Dhana?

768
01:03:47.208 --> 01:03:49.708
In God's name. I'll be the assurance.

769
01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:54.708
If God's willing, I will come
to your office tomorrow to deal with this.

770
01:03:54.791 --> 01:03:58.583
So you don't need to threaten her
to foreclose on this house.

771
01:03:58.666 --> 01:03:59.958
I guess it's clear, right?

772
01:04:00.041 --> 01:04:03.375
Okay. I'll leave, then.

773
01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:04.916
Okay.

774
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.125
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

775
01:04:07.208 --> 01:04:08.291
Thank you, sir.

776
01:04:09.708 --> 01:04:10.791
Thank you.

777
01:04:13.625 --> 01:04:15.875
Thank God.

778
01:04:15.958 --> 01:04:18.666
What do you say? A miracle, right?

779
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:21.166
Everything worked out just fine.

780
01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:25.125
That's because I'm the head
of the Neighborhood Association.

781
01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:26.541
Great, sir.

782
01:04:26.625 --> 01:04:29.916
That is called one connecting the others.

783
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.208
A miracle suddenly happens
because of a positive frequency.

784
01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:40.000
Actually, I've been looking for a place
to be made into a daycare.

785
01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:41.875
Because that's one of my dreams.

786
01:04:42.875 --> 01:04:46.625
And today, I didn't just find a house.

787
01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:50.208
God connects me to Kiki,
who I hadn't met for a long time.

788
01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:54.083
It's not like that, Dhana.

789
01:04:54.166 --> 01:05:00.416
The one who connected you and Kiki is me.

790
01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:05.875
Don't overlook me.
At least acknowledge my involvement.

791
01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:08.250
Make it positive too.

792
01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:11.083
You're right, sir. You're great.

793
01:05:11.166 --> 01:05:14.625
You're so positive. Just like sneaky tape.

794
01:05:14.708 --> 01:05:15.791
Sticky tape.

795
01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:17.791
Oh, yes. That's what I mean.

796
01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:21.625
Sticky tape. Although it looks like
an insignificant item,

797
01:05:21.708 --> 01:05:24.791
it has a great benefit.

798
01:05:24.875 --> 01:05:28.500
It can connect things
to strengthen the bond.

799
01:05:28.583 --> 01:05:30.458
Do you know the friend of sticky tape?

800
01:05:30.541 --> 01:05:32.708
-What?
-Duct tape.

801
01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:34.541
Good point.

802
01:05:34.625 --> 01:05:37.750
Do you want our hearts to be bundled
into one with a duct tape?

803
01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:38.875
Oh, my.

804
01:05:42.791 --> 01:05:46.666
Thank God, I've paid the mortgage
for this house.

805
01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:51.041
Thanks, Dhan.

806
01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:53.416
You've helped me solve all of my problems.

807
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.583
You're welcome. Thank God.
God makes everything easy.

808
01:05:57.791 --> 01:06:01.375
By the way, I hope you're willing
to manage this daycare.

809
01:06:11.541 --> 01:06:13.166
Honey, be careful!

810
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.208
Mom.

811
01:06:51.666 --> 01:06:57.125
Every day, I spend time
with other people's kids.

812
01:06:57.208 --> 01:07:00.916
But I can't spend time with my own kid.

813
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.250
Ki, you can take Bunga home.

814
01:07:05.333 --> 01:07:07.041
Really?

815
01:07:09.166 --> 01:07:10.708
Thank God.

816
01:07:11.833 --> 01:07:14.666
But only on weekends.

817
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.416
Why?

818
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:20.250
Ki, think of Bunga first.

819
01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:24.833
She's at the age
where she needs her parents' love.

820
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.250
Her dad died.

821
01:07:29.333 --> 01:07:32.166
Her mom is busy with her job.

822
01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:36.250
I'll let Bunga stay with you
on the weekends.

823
01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:40.291
Let her be with us on weekdays.

824
01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:46.750
Until she has a whole family.

825
01:07:46.833 --> 01:07:48.083
What do you mean?

826
01:07:50.458 --> 01:07:52.500
Do I have to remarry?

827
01:07:54.458 --> 01:07:57.916
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you too. Bye, sir.

828
01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:00.250
All good, darling?

829
01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.791
-Sheryl?
-Sheryl, your father is here for you.

830
01:08:13.666 --> 01:08:16.041
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you too.

831
01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.583
Bye.

832
01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:36.791
What is it, darling?

833
01:08:36.875 --> 01:08:39.541
How nice it is to have a father.

834
01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:45.541
Why does it have to be my father who died?

835
01:08:54.208 --> 01:08:55.416
Darling.

836
01:08:59.666 --> 01:09:02.833
Although your dad isn't with us anymore…

837
01:09:04.958 --> 01:09:06.458
I'm sure…

838
01:09:08.291 --> 01:09:11.875
God will always guard your heart
so you stay close to your dad.

839
01:09:13.375 --> 01:09:15.208
Don't be sad.

840
01:09:17.208 --> 01:09:20.375
Your dad would be sad
to see you like this.

841
01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:23.958
Where's your smile?

842
01:09:38.708 --> 01:09:40.666
Let me talk, future mother-in-law.

843
01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:43.458
My name's Arkan. I'm from Manado.

844
01:09:43.541 --> 01:09:46.500
I'm the youngest of ten siblings.

845
01:09:46.583 --> 01:09:50.000
But I'm the only one who's a "patingle."
You know what I mean?

846
01:09:51.666 --> 01:09:53.041
A pathetic single.

847
01:09:54.708 --> 01:09:56.083
Hi.

848
01:09:56.166 --> 01:09:58.708
My name's Dede.

849
01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:04.166
You don't need to call me
Big Brother Dede. Just Dede.

850
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:06.541
Because I'm still cute.

851
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:17.041
If you marry me, Zaki, you'll often go
out of town on a motorbike.

852
01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:22.291
Thank God, if you're willing to marry me,

853
01:10:22.375 --> 01:10:24.666
you'll be the fourth.

854
01:10:40.416 --> 01:10:43.583
Sir? Are you okay?

855
01:10:43.666 --> 01:10:44.958
Are you sick?

856
01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:48.208
Sorry. I'm nervous.

857
01:10:56.875 --> 01:10:58.375
Why don't you say anything?

858
01:11:00.333 --> 01:11:02.000
Do you want to be with me?

859
01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:03.791
Ms. Kiki.

860
01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:06.500
What about it? I miss you.

861
01:11:22.958 --> 01:11:27.250
Listen, Ki, I'm not asking you
to forget Ronald.

862
01:11:27.333 --> 01:11:32.208
Ronald will always be there
in your memories, your heart.

863
01:11:32.291 --> 01:11:35.000
But you can't be like this forever.

864
01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:38.583
The important thing is you have
to let him go.

865
01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:41.541
How do I do that?

866
01:11:42.708 --> 01:11:44.125
It's easy for you to say.

867
01:11:44.208 --> 01:11:48.250
People easily say, "Just let him go."

868
01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:50.500
But they never tell me how to do it.

869
01:11:51.833 --> 01:11:56.125
I've tried to forget Ronald.

870
01:11:56.208 --> 01:12:00.208
I've tried to open my heart
to another man for Bunga.

871
01:12:01.833 --> 01:12:03.500
But I can't.

872
01:12:04.833 --> 01:12:07.833
It's hard. I can't.

873
01:12:11.666 --> 01:12:12.916
Okay, then.

874
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.625
Don't be sad.

875
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:21.166
Come with me.

876
01:12:22.166 --> 01:12:27.166
We're going to a place
that can help us let things go.

877
01:12:28.416 --> 01:12:29.625
Okay?

878
01:12:32.083 --> 01:12:36.541
Enough. Stop looking at your phone.

879
01:12:36.625 --> 01:12:38.958
We want to have fun here.

880
01:12:41.875 --> 01:12:44.125
Peace be upon you.

881
01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:48.083
Peace be upon you too.

882
01:12:48.166 --> 01:12:51.041
Today, we're going to learn
how to attract blessings.

883
01:12:51.125 --> 01:12:53.125
To get miracles.

884
01:12:53.208 --> 01:12:55.250
Who wants a miracle?

885
01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:56.458
Me!

886
01:12:56.541 --> 01:12:59.000
-Who wants a miracle?
-Me!

887
01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:01.458
High five. Amazing!

888
01:13:01.541 --> 01:13:03.541
Amazing!

889
01:13:04.666 --> 01:13:09.083
Now, when I say something,
you say, "Wow, cool!"

890
01:13:09.166 --> 01:13:10.541
Your kid breaks the glass.

891
01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:11.791
Wow, cool!

892
01:13:11.875 --> 01:13:13.291
Your phone is missing.

893
01:13:13.375 --> 01:13:15.041
Wow, cool!

894
01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:16.875
You're fired from your job.

895
01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:18.166
Wow, cool!

896
01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:21.000
-Your house on fire.
-Wow, cool!

897
01:13:21.083 --> 01:13:22.791
Your husband remarries.

898
01:13:27.125 --> 01:13:30.916
Sorry, ladies.
I hope it doesn't happen. Amen.

899
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.875
But even if it happened,
we still need to have good thoughts.

900
01:13:36.958 --> 01:13:39.416
Because behind everything that happens,

901
01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:43.541
God writes the best scenario of our lives.

902
01:13:43.625 --> 01:13:45.375
-Agree?
-Deal!

903
01:13:45.458 --> 01:13:47.083
-Deal?
-Agree.

904
01:13:47.166 --> 01:13:48.500
-Agree?
-Deal!

905
01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:50.375
-Deal?
-Agree.

906
01:13:50.458 --> 01:13:52.166
High five again. Amazing!

907
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:54.250
Amazing!

908
01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:13.791
Thank you.

909
01:14:16.375 --> 01:14:17.208
Hey.

910
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:19.791
So how was that?

911
01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:23.375
I like it.

912
01:14:24.666 --> 01:14:27.250
Let me know if they do another one.

913
01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:31.708
You have to.
Joining Attract Blessings' training.

914
01:14:32.875 --> 01:14:37.291
We make friends
and it gets us closer to God.

915
01:14:37.375 --> 01:14:39.250
And support each other in goodness.

916
01:14:39.333 --> 01:14:43.000
For what? So we become more successful
and have more blessings.

917
01:14:43.083 --> 01:14:46.375
They taught us that "Wow, cool" thing.

918
01:14:46.458 --> 01:14:51.041
Does that mean we have to deal everything
by saying, "Wow, cool"?

919
01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:56.916
It's to train ourselves to always
think positively towards God.

920
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.541
So, everything that happens to us,
it depends on how we respond to it, right?

921
01:15:01.625 --> 01:15:05.750
Even a disaster can become a blessing.

922
01:15:05.833 --> 01:15:08.625
If we think of it as a problem,
then it becomes one.

923
01:15:08.708 --> 01:15:13.958
If we think of it as a blessing,
then it becomes a miracle.

924
01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:15.583
That's right.

925
01:15:15.666 --> 01:15:19.750
We can conclude that today is…

926
01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:22.166
Wow, cool!

927
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.958
That's how I like it. Keep up that spirit.

928
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:35.333
Cute, isn't it?

929
01:15:43.583 --> 01:15:44.958
Ma'am.

930
01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:48.375
What is this?
I paid a lot for these roses.

931
01:15:48.458 --> 01:15:50.666
But they're defects.

932
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:53.125
Did you trick us?

933
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.250
Let me check them.

934
01:16:01.458 --> 01:16:05.583
The roses are dead because you didn't
put them in the shade, did you?

935
01:16:05.666 --> 01:16:09.416
Roses aren't supposed to be put
under direct sunlight.

936
01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:14.791
I know that the roses here
are the best quality roses.

937
01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:18.083
We even have
the certificate of superior seeds.

938
01:16:18.166 --> 01:16:20.916
If you'd like to see it, I'll get it.

939
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.458
No. Is that so?

940
01:16:23.541 --> 01:16:26.000
Okay, then. Thank you, ma'am.

941
01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:28.875
-We'll take our leave, then.
-Okay.

942
01:16:31.291 --> 01:16:33.458
Thank you.

943
01:16:33.541 --> 01:16:37.125
You seem like you know a lot about roses.

944
01:16:37.208 --> 01:16:40.458
I googled it, that's how I know.

945
01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:42.125
Oh, right. Tasyi.

946
01:16:43.541 --> 01:16:44.750
Kiki.

947
01:16:52.625 --> 01:16:56.541
So, after your husband died,

948
01:16:56.666 --> 01:17:01.500
can you accept another guy as your
husband now? Can you open your heart?

949
01:17:06.541 --> 01:17:11.833
I'm starting to understand
that looking for a good partner

950
01:17:11.916 --> 01:17:14.416
is God's plan for my happiness.

951
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.375
In this world and in the afterlife.

952
01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:23.291
My son would be happy to know you.

953
01:17:30.958 --> 01:17:32.333
Mom.

954
01:17:32.416 --> 01:17:35.666
Remember what the doctor said.

955
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:38.041
You need to drink your medicine.

956
01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:41.000
Don't forget your doctor's appointments.

957
01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:41.958
Yes.

958
01:17:42.041 --> 01:17:44.000
You don't want another heart attack.

959
01:17:44.083 --> 01:17:45.625
Yes, I get it.

960
01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:50.666
Gas, this is Kiki.
I'd love it if you met her.

961
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.125
Yes, Mom. She's pretty.

962
01:17:52.208 --> 01:17:55.458
You didn't even look.

963
01:17:55.541 --> 01:17:58.083
Gas, I know you're not excited.

964
01:17:58.166 --> 01:18:00.458
But what if this is my last request?

965
01:18:00.541 --> 01:18:03.708
Mom. I will get married.

966
01:18:04.708 --> 01:18:06.083
But not now.

967
01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:09.416
I still enjoy my time with you.

968
01:18:10.916 --> 01:18:15.333
But until when? Until I get buried?

969
01:18:15.416 --> 01:18:16.916
Is that it?

970
01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:29.416
Just a moment.

971
01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:34.791
Peace be upon you, Mom.

972
01:18:34.875 --> 01:18:36.708
Peace be upon you too.

973
01:18:36.791 --> 01:18:41.583
Gas, accompany me to meet Kiki now.
I'll be waiting for you at home.

974
01:18:41.666 --> 01:18:44.625
Yes, Mom. I'll be there now.

975
01:18:45.625 --> 01:18:47.875
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you too.

976
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.458
-Mr. Rafi.
-Yes, sir?

977
01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:56.166
Please lead the meeting. I need to leave.

978
01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:58.541
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

979
01:18:59.708 --> 01:19:02.958
Mr. Bagas, I'm sorry. This is urgent.

980
01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:07.416
Twenty of our customers got their visas
withheld at the Saudi embassy.

981
01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.000
-Do I need to go now?
-Yes, sir.

982
01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:13.500
Or else our customers
won't be able to depart.

983
01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:17.041
Okay.

984
01:19:17.125 --> 01:19:18.375
Thank you, sir.

985
01:19:28.625 --> 01:19:29.833
Excuse me.

986
01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:33.125
-Thank you.
-Okay.

987
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:39.083
Kiki, thank you for taking the time
to meet me.

988
01:19:40.125 --> 01:19:41.375
Yes, ma'am.

989
01:19:50.875 --> 01:19:52.666
How's the food? Tasty?

990
01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:53.875
It is tasty.

991
01:20:00.208 --> 01:20:02.916
You don't have to leave in a hurry, right?

992
01:20:05.666 --> 01:20:06.750
No.

993
01:20:11.458 --> 01:20:12.625
Oh, dear!

994
01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:16.750
Oh, dear! Help! Oh, dear!

995
01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:21.541
Ma'am, what's wrong?

996
01:20:21.625 --> 01:20:24.791
Oh, dear. It hurts.

997
01:20:24.875 --> 01:20:28.708
Oh, God. Your water broke.
Let me take you to the hospital.

998
01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:29.791
-Okay.
-Let's go.

999
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:50.291
Kiki, I'm sorry.

1000
01:20:50.375 --> 01:20:52.125
I have another question.

1001
01:20:52.208 --> 01:20:56.583
What kind of man
do you think makes the ideal husband?

1002
01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:00.500
Just a moment.

1003
01:21:02.666 --> 01:21:03.875
Hang on.

1004
01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:08.916
Hello.

1005
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.041
Hello, Bagas.

1006
01:21:11.125 --> 01:21:14.375
Hello. Where are you?

1007
01:21:16.458 --> 01:21:17.958
At the hospital?

1008
01:21:18.041 --> 01:21:20.458
I know you're only making excuses.

1009
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.375
You…

1010
01:21:34.833 --> 01:21:38.458
Kiki, I'm sorry. I suddenly feel unwell.

1011
01:21:39.458 --> 01:21:41.416
Let me pay for this.

1012
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.083
-Okay.
-Sorry.

1013
01:21:43.166 --> 01:21:44.458
Okay.

1014
01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:06.708
Believe me, Mom.

1015
01:22:07.833 --> 01:22:10.333
I have no intention of avoiding Kiki.

1016
01:22:12.416 --> 01:22:14.500
I really was at the hospital.

1017
01:22:16.666 --> 01:22:21.041
A pregnant woman was about to give birth.
I was only helping her.

1018
01:22:21.125 --> 01:22:23.416
I needed to bring her to the hospital.

1019
01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:27.916
How can I make you trust me?

1020
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.833
You embarrassed me in front of Kiki.

1021
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:34.083
Forgive me, Mom.

1022
01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:39.000
Calm down.

1023
01:22:42.041 --> 01:22:43.458
Wait here.

1024
01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:09.375
Kiki?

1025
01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.875
Ma'am.

1026
01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:18.250
Thank you.

1027
01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.583
Bagas.

1028
01:23:27.625 --> 01:23:28.666
Bagas.

1029
01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:31.958
Kiki.

1030
01:23:41.208 --> 01:23:43.291
I'm Bagas Alif Wiratama.

1031
01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:51.083
I come with good intentions
to ask Rizki Amalia Putri to do taaruf.

1032
01:23:52.708 --> 01:23:55.916
I'm begging for a chance
to get to know each other…

1033
01:23:57.083 --> 01:24:00.458
with dignity and sincerity.

1034
01:24:03.708 --> 01:24:07.750
I hope this introduction process…

1035
01:24:07.833 --> 01:24:12.375
can be a part of getting God's blessings.

1036
01:24:12.458 --> 01:24:13.708
Amen.

1037
01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.583
Thank God.

1038
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:30.458
Let me.

1039
01:24:30.541 --> 01:24:31.750
Thank you.

1040
01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:42.250
Thank you.

1041
01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:49.500
Hi, beautiful.

1042
01:24:49.583 --> 01:24:53.583
My name is Bagas. What's your name?

1043
01:24:53.666 --> 01:24:56.333
My name is Bunga.

1044
01:24:56.416 --> 01:24:59.583
Hi, Bunga. You're so pretty.

1045
01:24:59.666 --> 01:25:03.750
-Thank you.
-I think we can already set the date.

1046
01:25:03.833 --> 01:25:05.000
I agree.

1047
01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:09.791
-Thank you.
-Badu.

1048
01:25:09.875 --> 01:25:12.875
-Are you in school, Bunga?
-I am.

1049
01:25:12.958 --> 01:25:18.708
This is for outdoors, for 30 people.

1050
01:25:18.791 --> 01:25:21.125
Uncle Bagas, what are you making?

1051
01:25:21.208 --> 01:25:24.125
-A crown.
-A crown?

1052
01:25:25.166 --> 01:25:29.041
A crown for Princess Bunga.

1053
01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:30.625
Thank you!

1054
01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:32.458
You're welcome.

1055
01:25:32.541 --> 01:25:35.000
Princess Bunga, you have to remember.

1056
01:25:35.083 --> 01:25:41.000
From now on, whatever you wish,
I will grant it.

1057
01:25:41.083 --> 01:25:43.583
Okay? Okay.

1058
01:25:45.916 --> 01:25:48.750
Thank you, Uncle Bagas.

1059
01:25:48.833 --> 01:25:50.375
You're welcome.

1060
01:26:05.416 --> 01:26:07.833
Oh, God.

1061
01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.500
Look at this.

1062
01:26:32.583 --> 01:26:35.041
This is a good model.

1063
01:26:35.125 --> 01:26:37.375
With this fabric.

1064
01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:41.250
It'll make you more beautiful.

1065
01:26:43.375 --> 01:26:45.666
It's nice, right? Do you like it?

1066
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:48.041
Or do you like another one? Which one?

1067
01:26:50.291 --> 01:26:52.500
Here's your medicine.

1068
01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:55.791
And the rice for
Ustad Nas's boarding school…

1069
01:26:56.833 --> 01:26:58.416
prepare it, okay?

1070
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.708
Bagas will take it there.

1071
01:27:00.791 --> 01:27:02.791
Yes, ma'am. Here.

1072
01:27:02.875 --> 01:27:05.333
Slowly. Take a deep breath.

1073
01:27:05.416 --> 01:27:06.666
Slowly.

1074
01:27:11.291 --> 01:27:12.416
Mom?

1075
01:27:17.083 --> 01:27:18.791
Why didn't you remind me?

1076
01:27:20.416 --> 01:27:22.958
We should've met the doctor today.

1077
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.500
I totally forgot.

1078
01:27:30.666 --> 01:27:31.833
I'm sorry.

1079
01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:36.250
How did it go?

1080
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:39.125
The fitting went well?

1081
01:27:48.083 --> 01:27:49.541
What did the doctor say?

1082
01:27:49.625 --> 01:27:53.333
It's her high blood pressure, sir.
She didn't take her medicines.

1083
01:27:55.208 --> 01:27:57.000
I'll step out.

1084
01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:01.958
What am I happy for…

1085
01:28:04.708 --> 01:28:06.916
if it makes you like this?

1086
01:28:24.708 --> 01:28:27.541
Forgive me. I really can't.

1087
01:28:29.166 --> 01:28:30.958
Forgive me for making this decision.

1088
01:28:33.083 --> 01:28:35.500
Ki, I'm sorry. Ki!

1089
01:28:46.875 --> 01:28:50.875
Bagas, you cancelled the wedding.
And you didn't tell me!

1090
01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:54.458
You're outrageous.

1091
01:28:54.541 --> 01:28:57.541
I don't know what else I have to do.

1092
01:28:57.666 --> 01:29:00.458
I forgot about you because of the wedding.

1093
01:29:01.916 --> 01:29:03.541
What if I get married?

1094
01:29:04.583 --> 01:29:06.250
You're outrageous.

1095
01:29:08.958 --> 01:29:12.083
Mom? Mom!

1096
01:29:12.166 --> 01:29:15.791
Mom. Mom!

1097
01:29:35.958 --> 01:29:37.875
Ki.

1098
01:29:37.958 --> 01:29:42.750
God will not test someone
beyond their capabilities.

1099
01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:49.000
If He tests you like this now…

1100
01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:54.750
that's because He knows
that you can get through it.

1101
01:29:56.333 --> 01:29:58.500
Why now?

1102
01:29:58.583 --> 01:30:01.333
Because it's the best time.

1103
01:30:01.416 --> 01:30:06.958
If He gave you this test before, maybe
you wouldn't be able to get through it.

1104
01:30:11.333 --> 01:30:12.875
Ki.

1105
01:30:12.958 --> 01:30:15.958
This is because
you're able to get through it.

1106
01:30:18.958 --> 01:30:20.958
Because God is certain that you can.

1107
01:30:23.708 --> 01:30:27.958
And you know what to do.

1108
01:30:31.083 --> 01:30:32.291
Okay?

1109
01:30:38.916 --> 01:30:40.916
-Thank God.
-Thank God.

1110
01:30:43.291 --> 01:30:45.708
-Wow, cool!
-Wow, cool!

1111
01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:48.041
That's it.

1112
01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:55.291
God has willed it.

1113
01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.916
What will you be after you graduate?

1114
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.333
I wanna be an entrepreneur.

1115
01:31:01.416 --> 01:31:03.750
-A hafiz.
-An imam.

1116
01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:05.166
A researcher.

1117
01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:08.583
God has willed it. What about you?

1118
01:31:12.375 --> 01:31:13.875
I wanna get married.

1119
01:31:17.291 --> 01:31:18.666
Don't laugh at him.

1120
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:21.125
All of your aspirations are great.

1121
01:31:21.208 --> 01:31:24.625
I pray that all of them come true.

1122
01:31:24.708 --> 01:31:27.125
Getting married is half of the religion.

1123
01:31:27.208 --> 01:31:32.375
So, no fooling around.
Getting married is the path to heaven.

1124
01:31:32.458 --> 01:31:35.541
There was a young man
who wouldn't get married

1125
01:31:35.666 --> 01:31:37.666
out of fear of neglecting God.

1126
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:43.250
And the Prophet said,
"I'm the most pious among all of you,

1127
01:31:43.333 --> 01:31:45.416
but I'm also married."

1128
01:31:50.625 --> 01:31:53.541
Getting married is my Sunnah.

1129
01:31:53.625 --> 01:31:58.625
Those who doesn't follow my Sunnah
are not my people.

1130
01:31:59.916 --> 01:32:03.041
Bagas, thank you.
Send my regards to your mother.

1131
01:32:03.125 --> 01:32:06.458
I hope the infaq becomes
the path to blessings.

1132
01:32:06.541 --> 01:32:09.208
For you, for Ms. Kasih,
and all of your family.

1133
01:32:09.291 --> 01:32:11.583
Amen. Thank you. You're welcome.

1134
01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:14.375
Ustad Nas.

1135
01:32:15.666 --> 01:32:17.625
There's something I wanna ask.

1136
01:32:17.708 --> 01:32:20.166
About your address earlier

1137
01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:22.750
about the young man
who wouldn't get married.

1138
01:32:22.833 --> 01:32:25.458
Oh, that one. What about that?

1139
01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:28.333
You're married, right?

1140
01:32:30.833 --> 01:32:32.791
I'm not.

1141
01:32:32.875 --> 01:32:36.375
You're not? How old are you now?

1142
01:32:36.458 --> 01:32:37.500
Thirty-one.

1143
01:32:40.208 --> 01:32:41.791
Let's have a chat for a moment.

1144
01:32:43.166 --> 01:32:45.291
-Oh, God.
-Yes, sir.

1145
01:32:46.916 --> 01:32:49.291
I'm 31 years old and unmarried.

1146
01:32:50.833 --> 01:32:52.083
Is it true…

1147
01:32:54.125 --> 01:32:56.541
that I'm not one of the Prophet's people?

1148
01:32:56.625 --> 01:33:01.666
Well, that's the point of the sermon,
to motivate the students.

1149
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:06.125
There are some exceptions.
Some ulamas are not married…

1150
01:33:06.208 --> 01:33:09.625
because they're busy
and are drown in their holy books.

1151
01:33:10.875 --> 01:33:14.416
But don't be like that, Bagas.
Get married.

1152
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
It's not that I don't want to marry.

1153
01:33:19.416 --> 01:33:20.666
I'm just scared…

1154
01:33:21.833 --> 01:33:24.875
that I can't honor my mother
if I get married.

1155
01:33:24.958 --> 01:33:26.875
Because there's lots of proof of that.

1156
01:33:26.958 --> 01:33:31.666
My friends, after they got married,

1157
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:33.583
they forgot about their mothers.

1158
01:33:33.666 --> 01:33:37.500
And I'm worried that if I get married,

1159
01:33:37.583 --> 01:33:41.125
it's as if I put an enemy in my house.

1160
01:33:41.208 --> 01:33:42.791
No!

1161
01:33:43.708 --> 01:33:46.291
We still have to honor our mothers.

1162
01:33:47.875 --> 01:33:51.416
And the path of honor
is not only by being a child.

1163
01:33:52.791 --> 01:33:55.791
Being a good husband and father

1164
01:33:55.875 --> 01:33:59.625
is also the path of honor
to get into God's heaven.

1165
01:34:01.875 --> 01:34:04.083
And that idea,

1166
01:34:04.166 --> 01:34:08.041
the thought of putting an enemy
in your house…

1167
01:34:09.125 --> 01:34:10.833
You have to forget that.

1168
01:34:11.916 --> 01:34:15.916
Do you remember?
Every thought is a prayer.

1169
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.333
Oh, right.

1170
01:34:17.416 --> 01:34:19.000
I ask for God's forgiveness.

1171
01:34:19.083 --> 01:34:22.541
And every prayer is answered by God.

1172
01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:25.125
You're right. I forgot.

1173
01:34:26.291 --> 01:34:27.666
Right.

1174
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:33.791
There's a story. An ulama said
that an old unmarried guy…

1175
01:34:33.875 --> 01:34:36.250
There are only two reasons for that.

1176
01:34:36.333 --> 01:34:38.250
First, he has a lot of sins.

1177
01:34:38.333 --> 01:34:41.416
Oh, God. And the second one?

1178
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.333
He's incapable!

1179
01:34:44.875 --> 01:34:46.041
God forbid.

1180
01:34:46.125 --> 01:34:51.708
I hope you'll get married soon.

1181
01:34:53.083 --> 01:34:54.208
Yes, sir.

1182
01:34:55.666 --> 01:34:57.750
Is there any hope, Doc?

1183
01:34:57.833 --> 01:35:00.583
We can only hope for a miracle from God.

1184
01:35:00.666 --> 01:35:03.583
In the meantime, I will
keep trying as much as I can.

1185
01:35:10.208 --> 01:35:11.666
Forgive me, Mom.

1186
01:35:14.958 --> 01:35:16.875
I have rejected your kindness.

1187
01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:20.416
I should've realized…

1188
01:35:24.541 --> 01:35:27.125
that getting married is for my own sake.

1189
01:35:30.416 --> 01:35:32.375
And I don't need to doubt that.

1190
01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.916
Forgive me, Mom.

1191
01:35:40.916 --> 01:35:43.958
I've now made up my mind to marry Kiki.

1192
01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.458
Be strong, Mom.

1193
01:35:54.666 --> 01:35:56.250
You have to be get better.

1194
01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:00.375
You have to get well.

1195
01:36:26.208 --> 01:36:28.041
I miss Dad.

1196
01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:35.666
Bunga.

1197
01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:39.333
Come here, darling. Get closer to me.

1198
01:36:47.541 --> 01:36:48.875
Do you miss your dad?

1199
01:36:51.708 --> 01:36:53.166
I miss him too.

1200
01:36:57.166 --> 01:36:59.625
We both love him.

1201
01:37:01.791 --> 01:37:03.333
But you have to know…

1202
01:37:05.208 --> 01:37:08.250
that God loves him more.

1203
01:37:11.916 --> 01:37:17.625
In time, we will meet him again.

1204
01:37:19.041 --> 01:37:20.250
Okay?

1205
01:37:22.041 --> 01:37:23.208
Come here.

1206
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:36.958
Let me open the door, Mom.

1207
01:37:52.416 --> 01:37:55.041
Peace be upon you, beautiful.

1208
01:37:55.125 --> 01:37:57.458
How are you, Princess Bunga?

1209
01:38:03.958 --> 01:38:05.166
What's wrong?

1210
01:38:06.916 --> 01:38:08.791
Did I bother you?

1211
01:38:08.875 --> 01:38:13.083
No, Uncle Bagas.
I'm happy to see you here.

1212
01:38:13.166 --> 01:38:18.041
I want to ask for your help. Would you?

1213
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.291
Ask for my help?

1214
01:38:27.125 --> 01:38:29.000
What do you need?

1215
01:38:29.083 --> 01:38:31.958
There will be an art show
tomorrow at school.

1216
01:38:33.166 --> 01:38:36.666
Will you accompany me
to perform the puppet show?

1217
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:39.541
The puppet show? Of course.

1218
01:38:39.625 --> 01:38:40.708
Let's go!

1219
01:38:40.791 --> 01:38:43.708
Uncle Bagas, you play the puppet as Dad.

1220
01:38:43.791 --> 01:38:47.958
And I play the puppet as Daughter.

1221
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:52.750
And what's the story? What does Dad do?

1222
01:38:52.833 --> 01:38:57.000
First, Dad kisses Daughter's forehead.

1223
01:38:58.166 --> 01:38:59.208
And then?

1224
01:38:59.291 --> 01:39:02.916
And then Dad tells Daughter
that he misses her.

1225
01:39:03.791 --> 01:39:07.875
Okay. Let's practice. Let's start.

1226
01:39:10.416 --> 01:39:12.416
Oh, dear, my daughter.

1227
01:39:15.333 --> 01:39:19.000
I'm so happy

1228
01:39:19.083 --> 01:39:22.708
to meet my very nice daughter.

1229
01:39:22.916 --> 01:39:26.500
I'm also happy to have
the nicest dad in the world.

1230
01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.458
Don't leave, okay, Dad?

1231
01:39:36.625 --> 01:39:38.416
Relax, Bunga.

1232
01:39:39.791 --> 01:39:41.541
I won't leave.

1233
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:24.250
Mom.

1234
01:40:24.375 --> 01:40:27.458
I'm set on marrying Kiki now.

1235
01:40:27.541 --> 01:40:29.208
I accept my decision.

1236
01:40:31.791 --> 01:40:32.833
Mom?

1237
01:40:34.625 --> 01:40:35.791
Mom?

1238
01:40:42.708 --> 01:40:43.875
Mom?

1239
01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:49.666
Forgive me.

1240
01:40:52.708 --> 01:40:54.333
Thank God.

1241
01:41:06.625 --> 01:41:09.541
I accept the marriage and wedding
of Rizki Amalia Putri,

1242
01:41:09.625 --> 01:41:13.666
daughter of Nur Rahmat,
with the dowry of 27 dinar paid in cash.

1243
01:41:14.375 --> 01:41:16.500
-What say you, witness?
-It's legitimate!

1244
01:41:16.583 --> 01:41:18.458
What say you, ladies and gentlemen?

1245
01:41:18.541 --> 01:41:19.916
It's legitimate!

1246
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.916
Thank God.

1247
01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:31.458
The wedding we just witnessed today

1248
01:41:31.541 --> 01:41:35.916
is one of God's miracles.

1249
01:41:36.666 --> 01:41:42.958
For some people,
marriage might be only a ritual.

1250
01:41:43.416 --> 01:41:47.625
But for Kiki, this is a miracle

1251
01:41:47.708 --> 01:41:50.375
after surmounting many obstacles.

1252
01:42:02.333 --> 01:42:06.875
A miracle can happen to everyone
in different forms.

1253
01:42:07.833 --> 01:42:10.916
A miracle for an ulama is called karomah.

1254
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.083
A miracle for mere human beings
like us is called maunah.

1255
01:42:15.166 --> 01:42:20.375
Today, we witnessed maunah
for Kiki and Bagas.

1256
01:42:20.458 --> 01:42:26.416
And, God willing, we will get maunah.

1257
01:42:28.583 --> 01:42:32.458
Because miracles exist
to those who believe.

1258
01:43:03.708 --> 01:43:07.083
EIGHT MONTHS LATER

1259
01:43:07.166 --> 01:43:08.416
Honey!

1260
01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:10.333
Mom!

1261
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.250
From now on…

1262
01:43:25.625 --> 01:43:27.208
that house is yours.

1263
01:43:28.916 --> 01:43:31.666
I bought it back from Dhana, your friend.

1264
01:43:38.291 --> 01:43:41.000
The baby's kicking? Are you jealous, baby?

1265
01:43:41.083 --> 01:43:42.666
Are you jealous?

1266
01:43:47.458 --> 01:43:48.625
Bunga, come here.

1267
01:43:50.583 --> 01:43:52.375
Bunga.

1268
01:43:52.458 --> 01:43:55.291
What name will you give
to your baby brother?

1269
01:43:57.708 --> 01:43:58.708
What?

1270
01:44:02.166 --> 01:44:04.500
Wow, cool!
