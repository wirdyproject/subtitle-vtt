00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.250
<i>Home.</i>

2
00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:32.917
<i>Honey, you taught me</i>

3
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.333
<i>that a home
does not have to be a building.</i>

4
00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.750
<i>Home exists within people</i>

5
00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:44.708
<i>and the love within them.</i>

6
00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:51.458
God has willed it.

7
00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:56.583
Glory be to God.

8
00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:57.792
Praise be to God.

9
00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:05.417
<i>You led me through every storm that came.</i>

10
00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:09.875
<i>You also said that they were not storms,</i>

11
00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.625
<i>they were gifts from God.</i>

12
00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:16.208
<i>Gandhi with his special condition,</i>

13
00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.042
<i>and we are there for him.</i>

14
00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:25.542
<i>Again you said,
"We are being elevated in God's eyes."</i>

15
00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.042
<i>It was all just a process.</i>

16
00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:33.042
<i>We just hadn't gotten used to it</i>

17
00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:37.417
<i>and it turned out
that we could get through them.</i>

18
00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:42.875
<i>In fact,
we received another wonderful gift</i>

19
00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.625
<i>that we've been praying for
in every prayer.</i>

20
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.167
- Praise be to God.
- All praises be to God.

21
00:01:51.792 --> 00:01:53.042
Come on.

22
00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:04.875
<i>But God's trials don't come just once.</i>

23
00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.250
Mother!

24
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:08.667
Adenocarcinoma,

25
00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:11.333
stage four.

26
00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:14.375
<i>We are asked to endure and be strong.</i>

27
00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:19.042
<i>Because being strong is our only option.</i>

28
00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:25.458
<i>Everyone who comes and goes
is only entrusted to us.</i>

29
00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:32.208
<i>When God calls them home,
we must accept God's decision.</i>

30
00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:36.875
<i>You often reminded me of that.</i>

31
00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:41.958
- Honey.
- Yes, honey?

32
00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:43.708
- Honey.
- Honey, what's wrong?

33
00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:45.458
Oh, God.

34
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.917
In the name of God. Oh, God.

35
00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:56.667
Honey.

36
00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:00.042
<i>But I'm only human.</i>

37
00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:04.792
<i>I can break down and lose my strength.</i>

38
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.708
<i>I had you. You were strong</i>

39
00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:15.542
<i>and always standing tall,
protecting me and Gandhi.</i>

40
00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:17.375
<i>But, you know,</i>

41
00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:20.958
<i>what keeps ringing in my head…</i>

42
00:03:22.417 --> 00:03:25.875
<i>What if being strong isn't enough?</i>

43
00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:26.792
Thank you.

44
00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:32.208
<i>What if things are still hard,
even after we let go?</i>

45
00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:53.208
God is the greatest.

46
00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:57.833
<i>What if I lose you?</i>

47
00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:01.042
Will you be strong?

48
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.500
Of course.

49
00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:11.000
<i>You're really gone.</i>

50
00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:18.083
<i>Leaving behind a name and memories.</i>

51
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.042
<i>Being strong won't be the same
because you won't be there to support me.</i>

52
00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:29.875
<i>Letting go will mean different things.</i>

53
00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:33.708
<i>You won't be there to make me strong.</i>

54
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.083
<i>And home will never be the same</i>

55
00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:40.625
<i>because you are not there.</i>

56
00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:45.708
<i>And I… I will also never be the same</i>

57
00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:49.792
<i>because the emptiness
you left behind is too vast.</i>

58
00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:53.750
<i>I miss you. Oh, God,</i>

59
00:04:54.542 --> 00:04:55.792
<i>I miss him.</i>

60
00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:08.333
ONE YEAR LATER

61
00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:12.917
Gandhi doesn't want to eat, ma'am.

62
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.250
Here. Please eat some.

63
00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:17.208
You're going to school.

64
00:05:17.292 --> 00:05:20.500
You'll play with your friends later.
Eat first.

65
00:05:20.583 --> 00:05:23.375
Gandhi, why don't you eat, dear?

66
00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:24.875
Here's the thing, ma'am.

67
00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:29.708
I told him
that you're going to school later.

68
00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:32.542
Then Gandhi didn't want to eat.

69
00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:34.667
It's okay, let me feed him.

70
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.583
Gandhi, dear.

71
00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:38.917
Let's eat, okay? Here, I'll feed you.

72
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.875
We'll go to school after this.

73
00:05:44.583 --> 00:05:45.875
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

74
00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:51.125
Gandhi, are you mad at me?

75
00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:54.417
Because I can't take you to school?

76
00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:58.750
I'm sorry. I will go afterwards.

77
00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.042
- Okay? Please look after him.
- Yes.

78
00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:09.875
Peace be upon you.

79
00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:17.167
ISLAMIC SCHOOL FOUNDATION
AL-KHAYR

80
00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:30.375
Sir.

81
00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:32.417
Sorry, I'm late.

82
00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:35.542
Let's just go right in.

83
00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:42.958
I remember the late Maulana
really wanted you

84
00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:46.000
to replace him
as chairwoman of the foundation.

85
00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:49.917
But I also have to be objective

86
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.708
because I am responsible
to make sure everything goes well.

87
00:06:55.792 --> 00:06:58.500
I think,

88
00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:03.167
moving forward, you can prepare
a better presentation.

89
00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.542
Sir.

90
00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:07.875
Thank you.

91
00:07:09.042 --> 00:07:14.167
For being loyal to Maulana and our family
to take care of this foundation.

92
00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:16.000
Moreover,

93
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.750
this past year,
you've been busy supporting me.

94
00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:26.750
Moving forward,

95
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.833
I hope I won't be a burden to you.

96
00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:38.792
But you'll have guidance, Latifah,

97
00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:43.042
during the adaptation
and transition period.

98
00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:49.375
Today, representatives from the center
will carry out an assessment.

99
00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:51.792
Peace be upon you.

100
00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:54.458
Upon you too, come in.

101
00:07:55.917 --> 00:07:57.542
- Please, Mr. Arman.
- Thanks.

102
00:07:57.625 --> 00:07:59.292
Mr. Sidik.

103
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.875
Mrs. Latifah.

104
00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:07.000
This is Mr. Arman and this is Mr. Sidik.

105
00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:09.708
They're both from the central foundation.

106
00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:13.500
Mr. Arman is head of education
at the center.

107
00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:20.333
They came from Surabaya
to oversee the chairman transition.

108
00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:23.292
Hello, ma'am.

109
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.250
Looks like you already know each other?

110
00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:36.458
We were college friends at Unpad.

111
00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:39.542
Arman is my senior, sir.

112
00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:42.542
- The same college?
- An old friend.

113
00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:46.458
If that's the case,
I will leave it to Mr. Arman.

114
00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:52.250
Let me show you the multimedia lab
which we discussed yesterday

115
00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:54.875
for the Chromebooks program.

116
00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.208
Yes, I'll be there, sir.

117
00:08:58.417 --> 00:08:59.500
Sure thing.

118
00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:03.042
This way, Mr. Sidik.

119
00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:04.542
I'll go ahead, sir.

120
00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.458
- Sure, Dik.
- He said "go ahead."

121
00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:08.083
All of a sudden.

122
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.375
Want to take a walk?

123
00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:24.958
Around this place?

124
00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.333
How are you?

125
00:09:28.792 --> 00:09:30.333
- Good?
- Thank God, good.

126
00:09:30.417 --> 00:09:32.917
- And you?
- Thank God, I'm good too.

127
00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:38.458
I didn't think you were
the owner of Al-Khayr Bogor.

128
00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.625
I was never involved in the foundation.

129
00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:48.208
But I often came here to see Maulana.

130
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.083
But since his passing,

131
00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:55.292
I'm now the one taking care of it.

132
00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:58.958
I'm sorry for your loss.

133
00:09:59.042 --> 00:10:03.375
Sorry, I couldn't come
because my mom was in the hospital,

134
00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:04.750
I must accompany her.

135
00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:06.500
Yeah, it's fine.

136
00:10:06.583 --> 00:10:07.750
How's your mother?

137
00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:09.750
She's fine, thank God.

138
00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:12.917
She's staying with me now.

139
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:28.083
It's been ten, 11 years
and we're a bit awkward, right?

140
00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:38.208
Is it okay if I don't take you around?

141
00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:40.958
Can you catch up with Mr. Wanto?

142
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.167
- It's fine, I'll catch up with Mr. Wanto.
- I'm sorry.

143
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.542
It's fine.

144
00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:48.750
- Peace be upon you.
- Upon you too.

145
00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:00.750
So, Latifah was your college friend?

146
00:11:01.458 --> 00:11:02.833
- Yes.
- Her husband too?

147
00:11:02.917 --> 00:11:05.375
Of course not. Just Latifah.

148
00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.083
I knew her husband
from the Al-Khayr gathering

149
00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:10.417
for all branches.

150
00:11:12.875 --> 00:11:14.000
How was it?

151
00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:18.000
He was a good man,
friendly, religious, intelligent.

152
00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:22.292
That's why Al-Khayr Bogor
received many achievements.

153
00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:24.750
Latifah, not the husband.

154
00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:28.542
You said the husband.

155
00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:31.208
Why would I ask
about her husband? Latifah.

156
00:11:31.583 --> 00:11:33.958
How should I know? Sorry.

157
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.542
Latifah, huh?

158
00:11:36.625 --> 00:11:42.500
Yeah. It's because
she's currently unstable.

159
00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.208
Latifah, huh?

160
00:11:51.458 --> 00:11:53.583
<i>Latifah is a smart woman.</i>

161
00:11:55.083 --> 00:11:56.792
<i>Top of her class in college.</i>

162
00:11:56.875 --> 00:11:59.375
<i>She got the highest GPA in Psychology.</i>

163
00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:03.708
<i>She also went on
to a Master's in Business.</i>

164
00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:07.208
But if it's about that, I don't know.

165
00:12:07.875 --> 00:12:11.083
Why she seemed to be confused
during the presentation.

166
00:12:12.292 --> 00:12:16.083
She's probably still mourning
her husband's death, right?

167
00:12:16.167 --> 00:12:17.167
Maybe.

168
00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:20.458
It's been a year.
She should've moved on by now.

169
00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:26.250
But women are experts
in history, right, Man?

170
00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:28.625
Archaeologists won't win against them.

171
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.667
But if I look at
how you explain it to her,

172
00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:36.667
I don't think you were
just friends with Latifah.

173
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.000
Right?

174
00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:42.083
Latifah is my ex.

175
00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:44.042
You're dangerous, Man.

176
00:12:45.208 --> 00:12:46.375
What do you mean?

177
00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:49.333
So, you two might get back together?

178
00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:53.333
Don't talk nonsense.

179
00:12:53.417 --> 00:12:54.500
Who knows?

180
00:12:54.583 --> 00:12:56.542
That's the past, Sidik.

181
00:12:56.625 --> 00:12:59.583
Now we meet
only to take care of the foundation.

182
00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:02.917
The past can be the future.

183
00:13:06.083 --> 00:13:08.500
It's fine for the presentation,

184
00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:12.083
but for the material,
at least someone will help you.

185
00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:13.417
That's what I meant.

186
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.125
This is only a suggestion, ma'am.

187
00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:20.875
What if you make a small team, ma'am?

188
00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:25.750
Then put together competent teachers.

189
00:13:26.042 --> 00:13:30.083
So we can get input
and perspectives from them, right?

190
00:13:31.792 --> 00:13:32.833
I think so too.

191
00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:36.000
That's good, then. Might as well ask

192
00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:39.583
regarding this matter
from the teachers' point of view.

193
00:13:42.375 --> 00:13:45.000
Thank you, Man.

194
00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:46.167
Mr. Sidik.

195
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.875
Sure, ma'am.

196
00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.333
Thanks for your help.

197
00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:50.958
You're welcome.

198
00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:57.792
I need to go.

199
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Yes, no worries.

200
00:14:00.042 --> 00:14:01.708
- It's okay, right?
- Sure.

201
00:14:04.458 --> 00:14:05.708
Mr. Supri.

202
00:14:06.833 --> 00:14:07.917
At the mechanic's?

203
00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:10.375
Okay, I'll pick Gandhi up.

204
00:14:10.458 --> 00:14:13.792
It's fine, I can order a taxi.

205
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.958
Fah, is Gandhi your son?

206
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.125
Want a ride?

207
00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:21.250
No, I'll take a taxi.

208
00:14:21.333 --> 00:14:22.708
No, I can take you.

209
00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:25.375
It takes a while.
Bring the car to the lobby.

210
00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:26.667
- Please.
- It's okay.

211
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.958
- But the taxi…
- Bring it to the lobby.

212
00:14:29.042 --> 00:14:30.500
Mr. Sidik, don't.

213
00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:33.750
Ordering a taxi takes too long.

214
00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:36.500
It's urgent, right? Come. I'll take you.

215
00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:38.250
- Is that okay, Man?
- Sure.

216
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.750
Arman.

217
00:14:46.792 --> 00:14:49.625
Dik, I'll drive.

218
00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.167
It's rare that you want to drive.

219
00:14:57.625 --> 00:14:58.708
Get in.

220
00:14:58.792 --> 00:15:00.042
Latifah.

221
00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.000
Mrs. Latifah can sit in front.

222
00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:07.958
- Will that be okay?
- Sure.

223
00:15:08.042 --> 00:15:09.458
Yes, please.

224
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.042
Ready?

225
00:15:24.792 --> 00:15:27.125
<i>Gandhi, don't do that!</i>

226
00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:31.292
- Come here, Gandhi.
- Dear.

227
00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:34.750
Don't! Gandhi. Don't do that!

228
00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:36.792
Don't be like that! Gandhi.

229
00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:38.958
Here, look.

230
00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:41.833
This is Mom. Let go of your hand!

231
00:15:41.917 --> 00:15:42.792
Let go!

232
00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:45.500
Don't do that!
Put your hands down! Gandhi.

233
00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:48.083
Enough. Don't do that!

234
00:15:48.417 --> 00:15:50.042
Don't hit yourself!

235
00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:51.375
Gandhi.

236
00:15:51.458 --> 00:15:53.292
Hey, dear.

237
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.542
Are you angry?

238
00:15:56.625 --> 00:15:58.000
Please forgive me.

239
00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:00.500
Don't do that! You're a good kid, come.

240
00:16:01.583 --> 00:16:04.125
Forgive me, okay?

241
00:16:05.167 --> 00:16:06.250
Let's go home.

242
00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:07.833
Come here.

243
00:16:09.042 --> 00:16:10.542
I can.

244
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.750
I'll carry you.

245
00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:20.250
Thank you.

246
00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:23.667
Sorry, Gandhi's been
having tantrums all month,

247
00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:27.333
more so since he lost his dino doll.

248
00:16:27.417 --> 00:16:29.667
It's okay.

249
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.333
We both know.

250
00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:36.292
Gandhi still can't express what he wants.

251
00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:38.500
But his progress is good so far.

252
00:16:38.583 --> 00:16:40.417
He already knows many colors.

253
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.958
Now he can also write.

254
00:16:43.042 --> 00:16:45.292
<i>For children with autism and ADHD,</i>

255
00:16:45.375 --> 00:16:48.750
<i>as long as we're consistent
with the simulation,</i>

256
00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:50.542
<i>that will help a lot.</i>

257
00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:09.583
Browsing for what?

258
00:17:10.583 --> 00:17:11.875
ADHD.

259
00:17:12.375 --> 00:17:14.125
What kind of food is that?

260
00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:17.250
That's PHD.

261
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.250
I'll pull your hair.

262
00:17:20.333 --> 00:17:24.208
Why is food always on your mind?

263
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.208
We're here to work, Sidik.

264
00:17:27.292 --> 00:17:30.542
Not having a culinary trip,
not having a holiday.

265
00:17:30.625 --> 00:17:33.458
Well, I thought that was a name for food.

266
00:17:37.042 --> 00:17:38.708
What are you looking at?

267
00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:40.917
Autism with ADHD.

268
00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:44.958
About Latifah's son, huh?

269
00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:49.542
Has she ever told you about this?

270
00:17:49.625 --> 00:17:52.000
I told you already.

271
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.833
I haven't been
in contact with Latifah, Dik.

272
00:17:55.917 --> 00:17:59.333
From a psychologist's point of view
like mine, Man,

273
00:18:01.208 --> 00:18:03.875
I feel bad for Latifah.

274
00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.250
How can she communicate with her son?

275
00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:08.125
I feel bad for her son too.

276
00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:10.583
She struggled to carry her son.

277
00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:14.208
She's in dire need of a man
who can carry her son, right?

278
00:18:17.458 --> 00:18:18.708
Calm down, smartass.

279
00:18:19.875 --> 00:18:22.000
Yes, you're such a know-it-all.

280
00:18:24.667 --> 00:18:27.708
Who knows if Latifah
is used to that, right?

281
00:18:29.125 --> 00:18:32.583
I'm good at reading people's psychology.

282
00:18:32.667 --> 00:18:36.250
I'm a psychology graduate too,
not only you and Latifah.

283
00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:38.500
I also graduated from psychology.

284
00:18:38.583 --> 00:18:41.792
I know you graduated from that.

285
00:18:42.292 --> 00:18:43.667
But you skipped class.

286
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.875
I needed to socialize.

287
00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.458
The lessons didn't only come from books.

288
00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:50.250
We need to socialize too.

289
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.083
Look at me now.

290
00:18:52.792 --> 00:18:54.500
Your subordinate, right?

291
00:18:57.167 --> 00:19:00.542
Hello. Yes, I'm almost done, ma'am.

292
00:19:00.625 --> 00:19:01.875
Thank you.

293
00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:03.625
Peace be upon you.

294
00:19:05.042 --> 00:19:07.292
- Peace on you.
- Upon you too.

295
00:19:11.458 --> 00:19:12.875
Am I disturbing you?

296
00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.208
Come in.

297
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.083
Are you working? Doing the presentation?

298
00:19:20.542 --> 00:19:21.875
May I help you?

299
00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.583
It's tidier.

300
00:19:30.542 --> 00:19:33.250
You're more confident, right?
Won't be nervous,

301
00:19:33.333 --> 00:19:35.458
you won't tremble presenting it?

302
00:19:36.458 --> 00:19:37.708
Of course.

303
00:19:38.458 --> 00:19:40.708
I see that Latifah thumbs up again.

304
00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:47.875
Picking Gandhi up from school again?

305
00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:51.333
Gandhi's off today to rest and get better.

306
00:19:52.583 --> 00:19:53.833
Okay.

307
00:19:56.458 --> 00:20:00.042
I… want to buy food,

308
00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:03.375
Bogor food. Want to join?

309
00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:06.375
I just told Mrs. Sum
that I'll finish soon.

310
00:20:06.458 --> 00:20:08.000
I'll just go home.

311
00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:09.667
Sure, no problem.

312
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.542
I was asking Sidik to tag along, actually.

313
00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:15.875
But I had to compile
Mr. Dwi's presentation material.

314
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.000
By the time I finished, Sidik was gone.

315
00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:22.375
That's your habit to lose track of time
while working.

316
00:20:22.458 --> 00:20:25.000
- So he left you.
- Who taught me that?

317
00:20:28.792 --> 00:20:31.500
- Okay, I'll get food by myself.
- Hold on.

318
00:20:32.083 --> 00:20:35.167
Want me to come along
for some local Bogor food?

319
00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:39.625
- But I can't stay long. Is that okay?
- Sure, that's fine.

320
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.458
Here! I think this is
the best Bogor noodle soup.

321
00:20:47.542 --> 00:20:49.958
But I'm not sure if you'll like it.

322
00:20:50.042 --> 00:20:54.375
Name one time I ever complained
about your food picks.

323
00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:58.083
I remember the noodles
from Bandung in Kejaksaan.

324
00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.208
I still remember.

325
00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:05.042
You have something that no one else has.

326
00:21:05.125 --> 00:21:07.875
I don't know what it's called,

327
00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:12.000
but you can find good food
in hidden places like this.

328
00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:15.042
Nowadays, kids call them "hidden gems."

329
00:21:16.083 --> 00:21:19.292
That's called the art of living.
Don't you know that?

330
00:21:19.375 --> 00:21:23.250
Finding the best way to survive.

331
00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:27.625
Thanks, sir.

332
00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:33.750
Finding cheap and good food.

333
00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:36.417
That's a perfect combination.

334
00:21:38.417 --> 00:21:40.458
We lost contact for a long time, huh?

335
00:21:41.083 --> 00:21:42.333
Yeah.

336
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.208
Maulana was there for me through it all.

337
00:21:47.792 --> 00:21:49.708
I needed him at that time.

338
00:21:50.667 --> 00:21:52.458
Now too.

339
00:21:52.542 --> 00:21:57.667
I'm sorry if this story makes you sad.

340
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.208
No worries.

341
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.917
You…

342
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.375
Since when did you know
about Gandhi's condition, Fah?

343
00:22:04.458 --> 00:22:06.583
When he was two years old.

344
00:22:07.792 --> 00:22:10.042
Yeah, two years old.

345
00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:11.917
Oh, two years old.

346
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
He wasn't like the other kids.

347
00:22:17.083 --> 00:22:18.167
He couldn't focus.

348
00:22:19.292 --> 00:22:20.542
Okay.

349
00:22:21.625 --> 00:22:27.250
I need to find time for him.
Take him for walks, into nature.

350
00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:29.042
He likes nature a lot.

351
00:22:30.708 --> 00:22:33.667
I want him to feel like
he has this time with me.

352
00:22:40.208 --> 00:22:41.708
Man.

353
00:22:41.792 --> 00:22:43.042
Why are you silent?

354
00:22:47.458 --> 00:22:49.958
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be on you.

355
00:22:50.042 --> 00:22:52.500
- I'm home.
- Your mom's home.

356
00:22:53.458 --> 00:22:54.667
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

357
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.167
This is Arman,
who brought us home from therapy.

358
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.958
- Yes, sir.
- How are you?

359
00:22:59.042 --> 00:22:59.917
Good.

360
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.917
Gandhi, look who's here.

361
00:23:03.583 --> 00:23:05.708
I'm Arman.

362
00:23:05.792 --> 00:23:09.375
Hello, Gandhi. How are you?

363
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.375
I'm Arman, and I'm a friend of your mom.

364
00:23:15.292 --> 00:23:19.125
I saw you yesterday, but you were asleep.

365
00:23:21.167 --> 00:23:23.500
Do you like drawing?

366
00:23:24.042 --> 00:23:25.042
What is this?

367
00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:28.542
A tree and Dad.

368
00:23:30.042 --> 00:23:31.042
A big tree.

369
00:23:31.417 --> 00:23:33.750
Gandhi, do you like sightseeing?

370
00:23:33.833 --> 00:23:35.583
- Sightseeing?
- Sightseeing?

371
00:23:35.667 --> 00:23:37.750
- Sightseeing.
- Do you like it? Nice.

372
00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:41.125
- Sightseeing.
- Let's go sightseeing with me.

373
00:23:41.208 --> 00:23:43.792
Or how about if we go tomorrow?

374
00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:47.583
You'll go sightseeing
with me, with Mrs. Sum.

375
00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:50.542
With Uncle Arman too, okay?

376
00:23:51.083 --> 00:23:52.333
Later, okay?

377
00:23:57.458 --> 00:23:59.750
Ice cream!

378
00:23:59.833 --> 00:24:01.292
- Be careful.
- Gandhi.

379
00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:03.417
- Mom, ice cream.
- Watch your step.

380
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.500
Let's get some.

381
00:24:04.583 --> 00:24:06.542
Man, he can't have ice cream.

382
00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:08.750
- Oh, yeah?
- There's a limit.

383
00:24:11.292 --> 00:24:12.333
So what do we do?

384
00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:15.500
There's a limit,
so he can eat some, right?

385
00:24:16.417 --> 00:24:18.292
Last time he had it was last year.

386
00:24:18.375 --> 00:24:19.833
So can I get him some?

387
00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:21.042
Just a bit, Man.

388
00:24:21.125 --> 00:24:22.583
I'll go get some.

389
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.750
Gandhi, your mom said it's okay.

390
00:24:25.833 --> 00:24:27.583
- What do you want?
- Ice cream.

391
00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:31.583
There's vanilla,
strawberry, and chocolate.

392
00:24:31.708 --> 00:24:33.167
- Vanilla.
- Okay!

393
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.167
Vanilla, sir.

394
00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.875
One vanilla, please.

395
00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:39.042
Yes, one vanilla. Okay, thank you.

396
00:24:42.875 --> 00:24:43.917
Thank you.

397
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.333
Ice cream.

398
00:24:57.417 --> 00:24:59.875
Okay. It's okay.

399
00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:04.708
- Okay.
- Ice cream.

400
00:25:05.208 --> 00:25:07.125
The ice cream is here.

401
00:25:07.208 --> 00:25:11.708
- We got the ice cream already, dear.
- Ice cream.

402
00:25:11.792 --> 00:25:16.042
- We got the ice cream already.
- Ice cream.

403
00:25:16.125 --> 00:25:17.917
Yes, we got the ice cream.

404
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.083
- I bought it for you.
- Ice cream.

405
00:25:20.167 --> 00:25:21.875
It's with your mom.

406
00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:24.875
Gandhi, calm down, okay?

407
00:25:24.958 --> 00:25:27.542
Calm down, Gandhi.

408
00:25:27.625 --> 00:25:30.125
I'll get you
lots of ice cream later, okay?

409
00:25:39.125 --> 00:25:40.792
Gandhi, dear.

410
00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:44.583
Calm down. Here's the ice cream.

411
00:25:52.792 --> 00:25:56.042
I don't even know how to thank you enough.

412
00:25:56.125 --> 00:25:59.500
- Is it too much already?
- Yes, Fah. Enough with it.

413
00:26:01.542 --> 00:26:03.375
I'm glad to see he's happy.

414
00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:06.458
I like playing with him.

415
00:26:06.542 --> 00:26:07.542
Why?

416
00:26:07.583 --> 00:26:09.333
New experience, huh?

417
00:26:10.417 --> 00:26:11.667
Yeah.

418
00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:14.958
To me…

419
00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:21.042
life is like a new page
that we have to turn every morning.

420
00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:29.292
What we never know is
what the story will be on every page.

421
00:26:32.458 --> 00:26:35.208
And I'm enjoying all the stories.

422
00:26:36.958 --> 00:26:39.167
Including the stories with Gandhi.

423
00:26:45.792 --> 00:26:48.833
You always amaze me, Fah.

424
00:26:50.958 --> 00:26:53.583
What's so amazing?

425
00:26:53.667 --> 00:26:55.083
All of it.

426
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.708
I just do what any mother would do

427
00:27:02.208 --> 00:27:04.792
and now I need to be a father for him too.

428
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.708
Gandhi must have missed his father.

429
00:27:11.792 --> 00:27:13.167
Of course.

430
00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.792
That's for sure.

431
00:27:19.333 --> 00:27:20.708
I also missed Arum.

432
00:27:23.792 --> 00:27:24.792
Arum?

433
00:27:25.833 --> 00:27:27.333
Yes, my daughter.

434
00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:30.083
My daughter, Arum.

435
00:27:32.292 --> 00:27:33.792
She's in the first grade.

436
00:27:35.042 --> 00:27:36.875
She's very active.

437
00:27:36.958 --> 00:27:41.333
She likes physical activities,
any physical activities.

438
00:27:44.292 --> 00:27:45.792
Sorry.

439
00:27:45.875 --> 00:27:48.292
I don't mean to compare

440
00:27:48.375 --> 00:27:51.167
- Arum and Gandhi.
- No.

441
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.375
You're not comparing them.

442
00:27:53.458 --> 00:27:57.042
- No, I'm afraid you're...
- No, all kids are special.

443
00:28:02.542 --> 00:28:03.958
Thank God, Man.

444
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.875
I'm happy to see you're happy now.

445
00:28:13.583 --> 00:28:15.417
- Thank God.
- Uncle.

446
00:28:16.208 --> 00:28:17.792
Let's draw.

447
00:28:18.458 --> 00:28:19.708
Okay.

448
00:28:21.292 --> 00:28:24.250
Draw what?

449
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.125
Trees.

450
00:28:26.208 --> 00:28:29.250
Trees? These trees?

451
00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:31.667
Let me see.

452
00:28:36.542 --> 00:28:38.458
Dinosaurs appear from these trees.

453
00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:41.833
Bite.

454
00:28:42.292 --> 00:28:43.125
Do you dare?

455
00:28:43.208 --> 00:28:47.125
Then the dino goes up.

456
00:28:52.167 --> 00:28:53.375
Gandhi.

457
00:28:53.458 --> 00:28:57.250
Gandhi, look at the dino.

458
00:29:12.958 --> 00:29:16.083
Does it hurt?

459
00:29:16.167 --> 00:29:18.792
But if it hurts, it can be treated, okay?

460
00:29:21.417 --> 00:29:24.667
Here. Right here.

461
00:29:34.792 --> 00:29:36.625
Rum, Dad is calling you, dear.

462
00:29:39.292 --> 00:29:40.542
Arum.

463
00:29:46.875 --> 00:29:47.958
<i>Peace be upon you.</i>

464
00:29:48.042 --> 00:29:50.167
Upon you too.

465
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.000
Busy? Why did you take so long to pick up?

466
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:55.917
Yeah, I'm busy persuading the cranky one.

467
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.333
Who's cranky? I'm not cranky.

468
00:29:58.417 --> 00:30:02.125
<i>So, someone wanted
to show off that she could ride the bike.</i>

469
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:05.083
She called her dad who didn't pick it up.

470
00:30:05.167 --> 00:30:07.583
Here, Rum, go talk with Dad.

471
00:30:09.833 --> 00:30:13.167
<i>I'm sorry, my beautiful daughter.</i>

472
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:17.083
I had a lot of work,
but I'm calling you now.

473
00:30:18.667 --> 00:30:21.333
<i>Are you sure you don't want to talk to me?</i>

474
00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:25.500
If that's the case,
I won't bring any souvenirs.

475
00:30:25.583 --> 00:30:28.458
Please bring souvenirs, Dad.

476
00:30:30.542 --> 00:30:32.917
Yes, I'll bring you a souvenir.

477
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.917
So, what did you want to tell me
over the phone?

478
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.458
I can ride my bike really far now.

479
00:30:41.542 --> 00:30:44.917
Some should accompany you
if you ride your bike far,

480
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.458
and please be careful.

481
00:30:46.542 --> 00:30:47.958
Yes, I promise.

482
00:30:48.042 --> 00:30:51.042
Let's switch, Rum,
I want to talk with Dad.

483
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.875
Honey, how are things going there?

484
00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:57.083
Everything's good. Thank God.

485
00:30:57.167 --> 00:31:01.958
Turns out the late Mr. Maulana's widow
is an old friend of mine.

486
00:31:02.042 --> 00:31:05.250
That's nice, then.
Everything should go smoother.

487
00:31:06.583 --> 00:31:09.292
Yes, it should be.

488
00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:10.750
Peace be upon you.

489
00:31:12.625 --> 00:31:14.167
Upon you too.

490
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.750
- Mrs. Ika.
- Mrs. Sum.

491
00:31:15.833 --> 00:31:16.917
Mrs. Latifah home?

492
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.125
Yes. Hold on. I'll call her.

493
00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:21.875
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Sure.

494
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.167
Ma'am.

495
00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:28.917
Mrs. Ika.

496
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.792
Mrs. Latifah, sorry to come so late.

497
00:31:31.875 --> 00:31:35.708
Just wanted to remind you
about the Community Leader election.

498
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.750
Don't forget to come.

499
00:31:37.833 --> 00:31:40.208
It was Mr. Maulana who used to come.

500
00:31:40.292 --> 00:31:41.750
Thank you for reminding me.

501
00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:43.292
You're welcome, ma'am.

502
00:31:43.375 --> 00:31:45.333
Ma'am, I also want to ask.

503
00:31:45.417 --> 00:31:49.250
Is the guy who often comes here
Gandhi's future stepdad?

504
00:31:49.333 --> 00:31:51.708
- No, he's...
- Thank God.

505
00:31:51.792 --> 00:31:54.375
Gandhi got a new dad real quick.

506
00:31:54.458 --> 00:31:59.375
I'm also happy for you, ma'am,
if he's your soon-to-be husband.

507
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.167
What's more, as women,
we must support each other,

508
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.875
giving our best.

509
00:32:04.958 --> 00:32:06.708
You should get married soon.

510
00:32:06.792 --> 00:32:10.250
He already has a family,
and we're just friends.

511
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:15.292
Is that so? He's just a friend?

512
00:32:15.375 --> 00:32:16.917
But he often comes here.

513
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.708
But he's just a friend.

514
00:32:18.792 --> 00:32:21.167
And he's someone's husband too.

515
00:32:22.042 --> 00:32:23.708
Okay then.

516
00:32:23.792 --> 00:32:25.708
Oh, one more thing, ma'am.

517
00:32:25.792 --> 00:32:27.042
Peace be upon you.

518
00:32:27.625 --> 00:32:28.875
Upon you too.

519
00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:35.417
Sorry, Mr. Arman.

520
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.958
Mrs. Latifah is still busy
and can't be disturbed.

521
00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:42.083
Okay.

522
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:44.792
But Gandhi?

523
00:32:44.875 --> 00:32:47.958
Gandhi is home, but he's resting.

524
00:32:49.792 --> 00:32:51.167
Is everyone okay?

525
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.375
- Draw.
- Latifah and Gandhi are fine.

526
00:32:53.458 --> 00:32:55.125
Mom, draw.

527
00:32:55.208 --> 00:32:57.958
- Sorry. I'm just relaying the message.
- Okay.

528
00:32:58.042 --> 00:32:59.500
Yeah, it's fine, ma'am.

529
00:32:59.583 --> 00:33:00.917
What are you drawing?

530
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:01.917
Sorry.

531
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.500
- Do tell Latifah.
- Uncle.

532
00:33:03.583 --> 00:33:04.583
I'll relay that.

533
00:33:04.625 --> 00:33:07.458
- Sightseeing. Uncle.
- Okay, I'll go now.

534
00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:10.708
MOM - GANDHI - UNCLE

535
00:33:10.792 --> 00:33:12.375
<i>Please excuse me.</i>

536
00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:17.500
You're single now, right?

537
00:33:18.458 --> 00:33:24.083
I don't want rumors to be spread, ma'am,

538
00:33:24.167 --> 00:33:26.125
because Arman often comes here.

539
00:33:38.208 --> 00:33:41.417
<i>Go tidy up, Man! We're leaving soon.</i>

540
00:33:42.458 --> 00:33:43.708
Man!

541
00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:48.458
Is this about Latifah?

542
00:33:54.083 --> 00:33:55.500
Here, that's mine.

543
00:33:58.292 --> 00:34:00.542
What now? We're leaving soon.

544
00:34:02.417 --> 00:34:03.667
I'm confused, Dik.

545
00:34:04.958 --> 00:34:06.208
What's wrong?

546
00:34:06.583 --> 00:34:08.250
I'm confused about Latifah.

547
00:34:09.792 --> 00:34:12.375
Everything was fine yesterday.

548
00:34:12.458 --> 00:34:14.583
We went sightseeing to,
where was it again?

549
00:34:14.667 --> 00:34:16.375
Bogor Botanical Gardens.

550
00:34:17.792 --> 00:34:19.625
I drove her home too.

551
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.083
And then, after that…

552
00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:26.792
She suddenly changed.
She didn't text me back.

553
00:34:28.167 --> 00:34:32.417
I don't know
if this has anything to do with you.

554
00:34:33.458 --> 00:34:37.208
But hear me out first.

555
00:34:39.792 --> 00:34:42.458
Why? Did you hear anything?

556
00:34:42.542 --> 00:34:45.458
You have a special relationship
with Latifah.

557
00:34:50.625 --> 00:34:53.292
I only want to help Latifah and Gandhi.

558
00:34:53.375 --> 00:34:54.625
What's wrong with that?

559
00:34:55.042 --> 00:34:56.083
That's wrong.

560
00:34:56.167 --> 00:34:59.000
You already have a wife.
Latifah is a widow.

561
00:34:59.083 --> 00:35:02.042
You often go out with her.
What would people think?

562
00:35:02.125 --> 00:35:04.000
What they think is wrong.

563
00:35:04.833 --> 00:35:09.292
You may not care, but Latifah does.

564
00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.542
She owns this foundation.

565
00:35:12.625 --> 00:35:13.917
She's the chairwoman.

566
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.375
She can't ignore this kind of problem.

567
00:35:22.583 --> 00:35:24.875
I'll be leaving for Surabaya, Mr. Wanto.

568
00:35:24.958 --> 00:35:26.875
Sure, Mr. Arman.

569
00:35:28.417 --> 00:35:29.792
Mr. Arman.

570
00:35:31.458 --> 00:35:35.667
Sorry if… I'm overstepping.

571
00:35:36.792 --> 00:35:38.833
If I may ask…

572
00:35:40.167 --> 00:35:44.083
The nature of your relationship
with Mrs. Latifah?

573
00:35:45.458 --> 00:35:46.792
My relationship?

574
00:35:46.875 --> 00:35:49.875
Yes, because I've heard
from the foundation managers

575
00:35:49.958 --> 00:35:53.375
that you and Mrs. Latifah

576
00:35:53.458 --> 00:35:57.083
are now very close
and often go out together.

577
00:35:58.542 --> 00:36:03.458
<i>I'm afraid
people are going to start rumors.</i>

578
00:36:05.458 --> 00:36:07.208
<i>I feel bad for Mrs. Latifah.</i>

579
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:10.208
<i>She has to raise Gandhi by herself.</i>

580
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:16.125
<i>Although, Gandhi is not her own son.</i>

581
00:36:16.208 --> 00:36:17.708
Peace be upon you.

582
00:36:17.792 --> 00:36:21.208
- Upon you too.
- Dad!

583
00:36:23.667 --> 00:36:24.917
How are you, Dad?

584
00:36:25.958 --> 00:36:28.500
- Good.
- Dad, where's the souvenir for me?

585
00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:32.250
God, I forgot
to get the souvenirs for Arum.

586
00:36:32.333 --> 00:36:34.542
But it was a lie.

587
00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:36.167
Look what Dad brought.

588
00:36:38.375 --> 00:36:39.583
Wow.

589
00:36:39.667 --> 00:36:43.750
Mom cooked a special meal for me.

590
00:36:43.833 --> 00:36:45.208
Ox tail soup.

591
00:36:45.292 --> 00:36:46.500
Wow.

592
00:36:46.583 --> 00:36:51.500
Did you know?
During business day at my school,

593
00:36:51.583 --> 00:36:54.542
Mom's cake sold out fast.

594
00:36:54.625 --> 00:36:58.500
Oh, yeah? How much money did you earn?

595
00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:01.542
Can I have some to get some ice cream?

596
00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:03.208
I want to save it.

597
00:37:04.042 --> 00:37:06.292
You want to save it? Good.

598
00:37:08.625 --> 00:37:13.125
Widya is something else. She took Arum
early in the morning to shop,

599
00:37:13.208 --> 00:37:16.417
then cook, and her food is delicious.

600
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.750
That's a must, Mom.
It's for welcoming my husband.

601
00:37:22.125 --> 00:37:24.708
Is that how you keep your husband
in check?

602
00:37:24.792 --> 00:37:26.792
Wherever your husband is.

603
00:37:26.875 --> 00:37:28.583
There's a charm to it.

604
00:37:28.667 --> 00:37:30.125
Love charm.

605
00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:36.167
How did things go in Bogor
with the new foundation chairwoman?

606
00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:37.875
What was her name? Latifah?

607
00:37:37.958 --> 00:37:39.208
Yes, Latifah.

608
00:37:41.167 --> 00:37:42.208
Latifah?

609
00:37:42.292 --> 00:37:44.208
You know Latifah too?

610
00:37:46.167 --> 00:37:48.417
Yes, I used to.

611
00:37:58.208 --> 00:38:03.750
You're home, in front of your wife,
and still staring at your laptop?

612
00:38:10.625 --> 00:38:12.083
Okay, honey.

613
00:38:12.167 --> 00:38:13.500
There, I closed it.

614
00:38:13.583 --> 00:38:15.667
What's wrong?

615
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.875
Tell me more. And our chat from dinner
wasn't finished either.

616
00:38:19.958 --> 00:38:22.958
How things went in Bogor, and then…

617
00:38:23.042 --> 00:38:24.375
What was her name…

618
00:38:24.458 --> 00:38:25.458
Latifah.

619
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.708
Yes, Latifah. Turns out Mom knows her too?

620
00:38:28.792 --> 00:38:30.417
Ya, she used to know her.

621
00:38:35.292 --> 00:38:38.667
But she's a bit different from back then.

622
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:47.042
She was independent,
knew what she wanted to do,

623
00:38:48.167 --> 00:38:50.958
but now her priorities might be different.

624
00:38:51.792 --> 00:38:54.208
She seems to be struggling a bit.

625
00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:58.708
Probably because of Gandhi.

626
00:38:58.792 --> 00:39:02.000
And then she has to take care of
the foundation too.

627
00:39:02.083 --> 00:39:05.500
Well, you know
how people from the foundation are.

628
00:39:05.583 --> 00:39:10.208
- Who's Gandhi? Her son?
- Yes.

629
00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:15.958
But I believe she can manage
because when she was in college,

630
00:39:16.042 --> 00:39:20.250
she was concerned with education
and she was also thoughtful.

631
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.792
It's just a matter of adapting.

632
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:31.458
How can you be so sure?
You just reconnected with her.

633
00:39:33.042 --> 00:39:34.958
I know her well, honey.

634
00:39:40.708 --> 00:39:42.125
What's the matter?

635
00:39:43.167 --> 00:39:45.792
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

636
00:39:45.875 --> 00:39:48.625
We chatted, right?

637
00:39:50.458 --> 00:39:53.375
I think I'm tired. I want to sleep now.

638
00:39:53.458 --> 00:39:54.917
We're done chatting?

639
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.458
No, I want to wake up early
to get Arum ready for school.

640
00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:14.292
You know Latifah too?

641
00:40:14.667 --> 00:40:17.792
Arman told me they were pretty close?

642
00:40:22.375 --> 00:40:23.708
Used to be.

643
00:40:25.833 --> 00:40:29.583
They used to be close, not with me.

644
00:40:30.958 --> 00:40:35.167
But I don't think they're close now.

645
00:40:36.583 --> 00:40:39.708
I never heard the name "Latifah," Mom.

646
00:40:39.792 --> 00:40:42.083
Arman never said anything before.

647
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.708
Well, maybe because they haven't met
for a long time.

648
00:40:49.792 --> 00:40:52.708
They've lost contact, so…

649
00:40:52.792 --> 00:40:56.667
Maybe Arman thinks
there's nothing worth telling.

650
00:41:01.667 --> 00:41:04.000
You know Nada, right?

651
00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:06.042
The one whose mother had died.

652
00:41:06.958 --> 00:41:10.208
They said that Nada
is going to get a new mom.

653
00:41:10.833 --> 00:41:16.500
But her new mom lives far,
so Nada's changing schools.

654
00:41:16.583 --> 00:41:22.333
I won't have a best friend
if Nada moves to another school.

655
00:41:22.417 --> 00:41:25.250
Nada is my best friend, Dad.

656
00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:29.208
I will definitely be sad if Nada moves.

657
00:41:29.292 --> 00:41:32.667
But they said that Nada is happy
to have a new mom.

658
00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:36.500
Are you listening to me?

659
00:41:37.625 --> 00:41:39.250
Dad!

660
00:41:39.333 --> 00:41:41.875
You're not listening, are you?

661
00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:43.500
I heard you, dear.

662
00:41:43.583 --> 00:41:46.500
What did I just tell you?

663
00:41:46.583 --> 00:41:49.042
It's about your friend, Nada, right?

664
00:41:49.125 --> 00:41:50.125
And then?

665
00:41:50.167 --> 00:41:53.500
- Nada is your best friend, right?
- And then?

666
00:41:53.583 --> 00:41:56.542
And Nada is happy to have a new mom?

667
00:41:56.625 --> 00:41:59.208
But I'm sad, Dad.

668
00:41:59.292 --> 00:42:00.792
Arum.

669
00:42:00.875 --> 00:42:03.917
Don't talk to Dad like that.

670
00:42:04.792 --> 00:42:09.667
Dad must be busy working,
so he couldn't concentrate on you.

671
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.625
Yeah, if you say so.

672
00:42:12.708 --> 00:42:14.375
Arum.

673
00:42:18.958 --> 00:42:22.458
What did you do? She's angry now.

674
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:25.583
Still occupied with Bogor?

675
00:42:27.083 --> 00:42:29.292
Yeah, a bit. But it's done, honey.

676
00:42:34.792 --> 00:42:36.375
Honey.

677
00:42:36.458 --> 00:42:39.167
I think I need to go back
to Bogor to finalize the election

678
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:42.667
of the new foundation chairwoman.

679
00:42:43.458 --> 00:42:45.542
But you just got back.

680
00:42:45.625 --> 00:42:51.208
Yes, but there was a conversation
with Mr. Dwi about this.

681
00:42:53.042 --> 00:42:57.500
But if you don't want me to leave,
I won't leave. I'll stay at home.

682
00:42:57.583 --> 00:43:00.667
Of course not. Have I ever asked you
not to go to work?

683
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:06.375
You were great today, Gandhi!

684
00:43:06.458 --> 00:43:08.542
I'm very proud of you.

685
00:43:08.625 --> 00:43:10.125
He's very smart, ma'am.

686
00:43:10.208 --> 00:43:11.375
God has willed it.

687
00:43:11.458 --> 00:43:12.750
Did you order a taxi?

688
00:43:12.833 --> 00:43:15.583
Yes. Mr. Supri was taking
Mrs. Sum somewhere.

689
00:43:16.875 --> 00:43:20.000
How about the guy
who picked Gandhi up the other day?

690
00:43:20.083 --> 00:43:22.500
He was my friend. He's not from here.

691
00:43:22.583 --> 00:43:25.292
He just happened to be in the area.

692
00:43:26.083 --> 00:43:29.542
Gandhi, I thought
you were going to have a new dad.

693
00:43:31.458 --> 00:43:33.375
Sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean it.

694
00:43:33.458 --> 00:43:34.708
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

695
00:43:34.792 --> 00:43:36.875
- Peace be on you.
- Upon you too.

696
00:43:36.958 --> 00:43:38.500
Uncle Arman!

697
00:43:38.583 --> 00:43:41.083
Speak of the devil. We just mentioned you.

698
00:43:42.042 --> 00:43:44.792
See you tomorrow, Gandhi.

699
00:43:44.875 --> 00:43:46.250
Okay. Bye.

700
00:43:46.333 --> 00:43:47.542
Please excuse me.

701
00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:49.458
Yes.

702
00:43:49.542 --> 00:43:52.542
- Gandhi, how are you?
- Good.

703
00:43:55.292 --> 00:43:56.833
Hey, Fah.

704
00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:01.833
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

705
00:44:02.667 --> 00:44:04.458
You never took my calls.

706
00:44:09.042 --> 00:44:10.375
Did I do something wrong?

707
00:44:13.667 --> 00:44:14.917
Please forgive me.

708
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.458
I spoke to Sidik…

709
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.250
About the rumors in the foundation.

710
00:44:28.917 --> 00:44:30.500
This is for the best, Man.

711
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.292
Mrs. Sum also spoke to me.

712
00:44:35.375 --> 00:44:37.583
Mr. Wanto asked me about it.

713
00:44:37.667 --> 00:44:40.542
The neighbors are gossiping.

714
00:44:40.625 --> 00:44:44.333
Over time, these bad assumptions
aren't just about me,

715
00:44:44.417 --> 00:44:46.708
they're about you too, Man.

716
00:44:57.042 --> 00:45:01.875
Please forgive me
for putting you in a tough spot.

717
00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.958
I forgot who I was too.

718
00:45:08.667 --> 00:45:09.958
No way.

719
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:13.583
Oh, yeah.

720
00:45:14.958 --> 00:45:17.458
The foundation's matter is finished.

721
00:45:18.167 --> 00:45:21.750
It's best if we go back
to our own lives again.

722
00:45:21.833 --> 00:45:24.542
Just like we were before we met?

723
00:45:26.458 --> 00:45:28.500
What do you mean, Fah?

724
00:45:30.208 --> 00:45:32.583
We can't do it, Fah.

725
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:38.958
There are still many things I want to do
to ease your burden, Fah.

726
00:45:40.458 --> 00:45:43.958
I often think about Gandhi,
whether he's okay or not.

727
00:45:44.042 --> 00:45:46.042
And you too.

728
00:45:46.125 --> 00:45:49.333
So, you can't ask me to do that, Fah,

729
00:45:49.417 --> 00:45:51.542
- to go back...
- It's different, Man.

730
00:45:51.625 --> 00:45:54.083
It's already different.

731
00:45:54.167 --> 00:45:58.208
You're someone's husband. I'm a widow.

732
00:45:58.292 --> 00:46:00.000
People think of that, Man.

733
00:46:00.083 --> 00:46:02.375
That's what people think, Fah.

734
00:46:02.458 --> 00:46:05.500
They don't know how you and Gandhi feel.

735
00:46:05.583 --> 00:46:07.333
- They don't know.
- Man.

736
00:46:08.333 --> 00:46:11.833
If you care about Gandhi and I,

737
00:46:12.417 --> 00:46:14.542
I ask that you stay away from me.

738
00:46:14.625 --> 00:46:17.750
You didn't feel Gandhi's happiness
yesterday, Fah?

739
00:46:19.417 --> 00:46:22.958
Your happiness, your lighter burden.
You didn't feel that?

740
00:46:23.042 --> 00:46:24.500
I felt it, Man.

741
00:46:24.583 --> 00:46:27.875
I was glad to see you and Gandhi happy.

742
00:46:27.958 --> 00:46:32.292
I also saw Gandhi happy,
but what can I do now?

743
00:46:35.417 --> 00:46:36.500
Any solutions?

744
00:46:39.583 --> 00:46:40.792
There are none, right?

745
00:46:41.958 --> 00:46:44.292
Do I need to marry you, Fah?

746
00:46:45.458 --> 00:46:46.458
What?

747
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:50.875
Yes, do I need to marry you
to stop the negative chatter?

748
00:47:01.083 --> 00:47:02.333
Man.

749
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.042
You already have a wife.

750
00:47:11.375 --> 00:47:13.375
You have a daughter.

751
00:47:15.542 --> 00:47:19.625
They're now waiting for you at home,
for you to come home.

752
00:47:20.292 --> 00:47:22.000
I'm a woman, Man.

753
00:47:22.833 --> 00:47:25.167
I know how Widya feels.

754
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.750
I'm sorry, I…

755
00:47:34.292 --> 00:47:36.000
I feel it again, Fah.

756
00:47:37.958 --> 00:47:40.000
I don't know why.

757
00:47:42.958 --> 00:47:44.875
I care about you.

758
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.042
Sorry I have to say this, Fah.

759
00:47:55.208 --> 00:47:57.500
I only want to be honest, Fah.

760
00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:01.250
What about your wife?

761
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.333
Can you be honest with her?

762
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:13.333
You can't, can't you?

763
00:48:25.875 --> 00:48:28.167
Latifah is your past.

764
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:30.875
Widya and Arum are waiting for you here.

765
00:48:31.458 --> 00:48:33.875
They are your future.

766
00:48:34.625 --> 00:48:35.750
<i>Dad…</i>

767
00:48:35.833 --> 00:48:39.208
Dad…

768
00:48:42.458 --> 00:48:43.958
Thank you, Dad.

769
00:48:44.792 --> 00:48:47.625
I'm praying together with you again.

770
00:48:53.542 --> 00:48:58.958
<i>If we feel we've made mistakes in life,</i>

771
00:48:59.042 --> 00:49:03.250
<i>we need to repent to God and do better.</i>

772
00:49:03.333 --> 00:49:08.125
<i>When we change for the better,
God will test us again</i>

773
00:49:08.208 --> 00:49:15.167
<i>in this life, through our families,
society and more.</i>

774
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:18.708
<i>And when the trials
are given to us by God,</i>

775
00:49:18.792 --> 00:49:22.792
<i>think of it as God's effort
to purify ourselves</i>

776
00:49:22.875 --> 00:49:25.292
<i>as we head towards Him.</i>

777
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:36.583
- Hi, honey.
- Honey.

778
00:49:36.667 --> 00:49:38.625
Why aren't you ready for work?

779
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:41.292
I want to take a day off.

780
00:49:44.542 --> 00:49:45.708
Where's Mom?

781
00:49:45.792 --> 00:49:48.458
Mom went to Auntie's early this morning.

782
00:49:49.083 --> 00:49:53.750
She said she'll be late, but it's Mom.
She'll stay there if it's too late.

783
00:49:58.667 --> 00:49:59.917
What's wrong?

784
00:50:01.792 --> 00:50:04.167
You've been quiet lately.

785
00:50:15.417 --> 00:50:17.042
What's wrong?

786
00:50:46.333 --> 00:50:48.542
Hey, what's wrong?

787
00:50:54.958 --> 00:50:56.333
I want to…

788
00:50:59.208 --> 00:51:00.542
I want to talk.

789
00:51:02.833 --> 00:51:04.625
About what?

790
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.083
About me.

791
00:51:10.375 --> 00:51:15.875
But before I do, I want you to know…

792
00:51:17.958 --> 00:51:21.583
That I really love you.

793
00:51:23.625 --> 00:51:25.750
Very much.

794
00:51:25.833 --> 00:51:28.458
Why are you talking about feelings?

795
00:51:28.542 --> 00:51:29.875
What's wrong?

796
00:51:33.083 --> 00:51:36.042
I haven't been completely honest with you.

797
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:38.625
About what?

798
00:51:42.458 --> 00:51:43.625
Latifah.

799
00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:53.167
She wasn't just a college friend.

800
00:52:02.667 --> 00:52:08.292
I told you before
that we were close, right?

801
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:12.167
And?

802
00:52:15.792 --> 00:52:19.375
We were about to get married.

803
00:52:22.958 --> 00:52:24.208
Just listen.

804
00:52:28.875 --> 00:52:30.875
I'm sorry.

805
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:35.167
I want to tell you…

806
00:52:37.417 --> 00:52:38.500
I want you to know.

807
00:52:41.083 --> 00:52:42.542
I don't know how.

808
00:52:44.458 --> 00:52:49.667
The feelings that I have for you…

809
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.625
I have those same feelings
for Latifah too.

810
00:53:00.375 --> 00:53:01.500
What do you mean?

811
00:53:03.958 --> 00:53:07.250
The same feelings, what does it mean?

812
00:53:09.042 --> 00:53:11.208
You're in love with her?

813
00:53:12.583 --> 00:53:14.542
You're in love with Latifah?

814
00:53:16.583 --> 00:53:20.083
What are "the same feelings"?
Don't compare me with that woman.

815
00:53:20.958 --> 00:53:21.958
Don't get angry.

816
00:53:22.042 --> 00:53:25.583
I don't mean to compare you
with anyone, not that.

817
00:53:25.667 --> 00:53:28.958
I just don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

818
00:53:29.042 --> 00:53:31.542
I don't want you to blame Latifah.

819
00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:33.292
It's not her fault?

820
00:53:33.375 --> 00:53:35.708
Are you defending her in front of me?

821
00:53:36.417 --> 00:53:38.375
If it's not her fault, is it mine?

822
00:53:40.167 --> 00:53:42.583
Listen…
You're crazy. You want my pity?

823
00:53:42.667 --> 00:53:45.292
I'm not defending anyone.
I try to be honest.

824
00:53:45.375 --> 00:53:47.042
I want to talk calmly.

825
00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:50.042
Calmly?

826
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.500
How can I talk calmly
after you said those things?

827
00:54:01.667 --> 00:54:05.667
So what do you want? A divorce?

828
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:08.083
Oh, God, who would want...

829
00:54:08.167 --> 00:54:09.667
You want to choose her?

830
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.958
It's not divorce.

831
00:54:21.125 --> 00:54:24.792
Then what? What haven't I done for you?

832
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.708
For Arum, for this family.
What haven't I done?

833
00:54:38.417 --> 00:54:40.458
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

834
00:54:43.208 --> 00:54:44.708
You've done everything.

835
00:54:44.792 --> 00:54:46.708
You are an amazing woman.

836
00:54:46.792 --> 00:54:49.542
A good mother. I'm happy with you.

837
00:54:49.625 --> 00:54:50.875
- That's a lie!
- I do.

838
00:54:50.958 --> 00:54:55.375
That's a lie! If you were happy,
you won't find other woman, Man.

839
00:54:58.125 --> 00:55:00.792
I'm your wife. I can read you.

840
00:55:01.792 --> 00:55:03.542
I've been suspicious lately,

841
00:55:03.625 --> 00:55:08.083
but I tried hard to convince myself
I was just imagining it.

842
00:55:08.167 --> 00:55:09.667
There's nothing going on.

843
00:55:10.458 --> 00:55:12.208
But it's true, right?

844
00:55:12.292 --> 00:55:14.000
You're cheating, right?

845
00:55:14.083 --> 00:55:16.292
No, I didn't do anything.

846
00:55:16.375 --> 00:55:17.917
Then what is this?

847
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.875
If you have feelings for her, what's that?

848
00:55:20.958 --> 00:55:22.208
Isn't that cheating?

849
00:55:23.083 --> 00:55:24.250
You're crazy, Man!

850
00:55:27.667 --> 00:55:28.958
I'm devastated.

851
00:56:07.417 --> 00:56:09.042
Why are you awake?

852
00:56:09.125 --> 00:56:12.375
Why are you sleeping with me
all of a sudden?

853
00:56:12.458 --> 00:56:13.750
I miss you.

854
00:56:15.083 --> 00:56:18.708
I like sleeping next to you.

855
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:23.542
Dad, don't be gone too long, okay?

856
00:56:24.417 --> 00:56:26.750
I miss you when you're gone.

857
00:56:44.208 --> 00:56:46.000
Gandhi, dear.

858
00:56:46.625 --> 00:56:48.208
Let's stop drawing, okay?

859
00:56:48.292 --> 00:56:49.625
Finish it tomorrow.

860
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.958
You need to sleep now. Come on, dear.

861
00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.875
Mom.

862
00:56:54.958 --> 00:56:56.708
Where is Uncle?

863
00:56:57.667 --> 00:56:59.500
Uncle sightseeing.

864
00:57:02.667 --> 00:57:04.708
I miss Uncle.

865
00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:12.625
Be patient.

866
00:57:15.042 --> 00:57:17.125
I know you're a strong woman…

867
00:57:19.667 --> 00:57:22.083
And never feel alone.

868
00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.500
Arum.

869
00:57:37.875 --> 00:57:39.125
Arum.

870
00:58:03.083 --> 00:58:06.250
Man. Where's Widya?

871
00:58:08.292 --> 00:58:10.042
Man.

872
00:58:10.125 --> 00:58:13.167
Why did Widya text me,
entrusting the house to me?

873
00:58:14.792 --> 00:58:16.417
Where are Widya and Arum?

874
00:58:18.833 --> 00:58:20.542
Man, answer me.

875
00:58:20.625 --> 00:58:22.042
I don't know, Mom.

876
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:26.917
The house was empty when I got here.

877
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.250
They're gone.
Widya also didn't take up my calls.

878
00:58:30.333 --> 00:58:32.708
Auntie, this can't be.

879
00:58:32.792 --> 00:58:35.458
Widya always picks up her phone.

880
00:58:36.458 --> 00:58:39.042
Widya always picks up a call from you.

881
00:58:39.875 --> 00:58:41.125
What's going on, Man?

882
00:58:42.042 --> 00:58:44.583
Explain. What's happening?

883
00:58:45.208 --> 00:58:46.833
Where are Widya and Arum?

884
00:58:50.292 --> 00:58:51.542
Man?

885
00:58:52.667 --> 00:58:54.125
Answer me.

886
00:58:57.375 --> 00:59:01.833
I told Widya the truth, Mom,
about my feelings for Latifah.

887
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.250
Feelings?

888
00:59:06.208 --> 00:59:09.042
What feelings do you have for Latifah?

889
00:59:10.875 --> 00:59:12.125
I'm asking you.

890
00:59:16.958 --> 00:59:18.208
Don't you get it, Man?

891
00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:22.042
You've hurt Widya's feelings.

892
00:59:29.958 --> 00:59:34.458
How could you?
How could you be this stupid, Man?

893
00:59:37.833 --> 00:59:40.667
I've told you many times.

894
00:59:41.208 --> 00:59:44.083
This is it. This is what I was afraid of.

895
00:59:44.167 --> 00:59:46.792
I only wanted to be honest
with Widya, Mom.

896
00:59:48.417 --> 00:59:50.417
I don't want to lie to her.

897
00:59:52.625 --> 00:59:54.250
I don't want a divorce.

898
00:59:55.083 --> 00:59:57.250
I don't, but I also don't get

899
00:59:57.333 --> 01:00:00.458
why my feelings for Latifah are back.
I don't know, Mom.

900
01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:03.792
Feelings? Your feelings?

901
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.583
You talked about how you feel?

902
01:00:07.667 --> 01:00:10.375
Did you think about Widya's feelings?

903
01:00:11.125 --> 01:00:14.042
Did you think about Arum's feelings?

904
01:00:16.333 --> 01:00:17.708
Man.

905
01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:21.708
You…

906
01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:24.708
Do you know?

907
01:00:25.958 --> 01:00:27.667
I'm also a woman, Man.

908
01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:30.250
Auntie is also a woman.

909
01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:37.208
We know exactly how it feels
to be hurt by our spouse.

910
01:00:45.333 --> 01:00:46.583
Man.

911
01:00:48.167 --> 01:00:49.792
Do you know?

912
01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:54.167
When a woman is hurt,

913
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.833
they keep their feelings bottled up.

914
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.375
And that hurts a lot more.

915
01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:11.042
I can't imagine how Widya feels right now.

916
01:01:12.417 --> 01:01:16.000
Widya must be devastated because of you!

917
01:01:27.667 --> 01:01:30.375
<i>But Dad won't leave
for long again, right, Mom?</i>

918
01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:35.375
Dad promised me
that he won't be gone for long again.

919
01:01:40.708 --> 01:01:42.083
Yes, dear.

920
01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:26.167
Wid, I know how you feel. Let's meet up.

921
01:03:27.167 --> 01:03:30.708
<i>I thought I was happy with Arman, Auntie.</i>

922
01:03:30.833 --> 01:03:33.417
<i>Nothing lacking in our family.</i>

923
01:03:38.375 --> 01:03:41.250
But now I don't know what to believe.

924
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:47.792
I don't think
I even believe in myself anymore.

925
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.583
I've been thinking since yesterday.

926
01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.500
Is it true that it's my fault?

927
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.042
Could it be because I can't keep up
with Arman?

928
01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:07.750
Never listen to what Arman wants?

929
01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:17.250
What does Latifah have
that I don't, Auntie?

930
01:04:17.792 --> 01:04:20.292
Don't blame yourself.

931
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.250
You're not Latifah.

932
01:04:24.292 --> 01:04:26.917
And the problem isn't with you, Wid.

933
01:04:27.833 --> 01:04:31.042
I can't bear to lose Arman, Auntie.

934
01:04:33.292 --> 01:04:37.875
But I also can't stand
if I have to share Arman with Latifah.

935
01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:48.167
I've never dreamed of going through
something like this, Auntie.

936
01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:55.625
I understand what it feels like
to be betrayed, lied to.

937
01:04:55.708 --> 01:04:59.125
When your uncle remarried,

938
01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:01.542
I heard it from someone else.

939
01:05:02.458 --> 01:05:05.208
Be patient, be strong.

940
01:05:05.833 --> 01:05:10.375
Be calm. Keep your mind clear.

941
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:16.042
Arman still wants to save your marriage.

942
01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:20.333
Talk, think,

943
01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.417
and decide, okay?

944
01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:30.250
You have to think of Arum, dear.

945
01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:32.375
Arum doesn't know anything.

946
01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:35.708
Be strong, okay?

947
01:05:35.792 --> 01:05:36.792
<i>Dad.</i>

948
01:05:36.875 --> 01:05:38.583
Let's go home, okay?

949
01:05:44.583 --> 01:05:46.167
Let's go home, honey.

950
01:05:50.542 --> 01:05:51.958
I'm sorry.

951
01:05:56.292 --> 01:05:58.750
I'm happy to have you and Arum.

952
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.750
Happy.

953
01:06:10.417 --> 01:06:14.625
But on how my feelings suddenly grew,
I also can't…

954
01:06:16.292 --> 01:06:19.958
Yes. You let those feelings grow.

955
01:06:21.958 --> 01:06:25.750
You don't even remember that me and Arum
are waiting for you.

956
01:06:26.333 --> 01:06:29.250
I always remember you and Arum, honey.

957
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.542
Never have I forgotten about
you and Arum, never.

958
01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:40.125
It's exactly because of how I feel
about you and Arum.

959
01:06:41.167 --> 01:06:45.250
That's what made my feelings
for Latifah and Gandhi grow,

960
01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:47.333
to protect them, honey.

961
01:06:48.458 --> 01:06:52.667
I know the time and history
I have with Latifah,

962
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:54.417
we should have been apart.

963
01:06:56.125 --> 01:06:58.333
I know I'm guilty for that.

964
01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:00.542
But I'd be more guilty

965
01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:03.875
if I didn't tell you the truth
about it all, honey.

966
01:07:03.958 --> 01:07:05.208
So?

967
01:07:05.292 --> 01:07:09.125
When you see Latifah
with those feelings of yours…

968
01:07:11.083 --> 01:07:13.625
Did you consider my feelings, Man?

969
01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:17.792
How could you?

970
01:07:19.417 --> 01:07:22.292
You made me question myself.

971
01:07:32.958 --> 01:07:34.500
I'm sorry, okay?

972
01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:43.542
I want to see that woman.

973
01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:55.250
You know Arman has feelings for you?

974
01:08:02.625 --> 01:08:05.042
You have the same feelings for Arman too?

975
01:08:08.208 --> 01:08:12.542
Why are you quiet?
Are you confused about your own feelings?

976
01:08:16.917 --> 01:08:19.417
Do you know that Arman wants to marry you?

977
01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:23.375
Arman is my past.

978
01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:30.750
If you knew you had a past with him,
you shouldn't rekindle things, right?

979
01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:34.000
Even as friends.

980
01:08:34.083 --> 01:08:38.500
Or are you deliberately
looking for a new husband?

981
01:08:42.167 --> 01:08:43.875
I am on my own…

982
01:08:45.292 --> 01:08:47.542
But I can manage that.

983
01:08:47.625 --> 01:08:50.417
No one can replace my husband.

984
01:08:51.667 --> 01:08:53.250
So what's this all about?

985
01:08:55.583 --> 01:08:56.833
Hold on.

986
01:08:57.542 --> 01:08:58.875
Hello, ma'am.

987
01:09:02.458 --> 01:09:04.458
Try giving him the vomiting pill.

988
01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:07.000
Yes, I'll be home in a minute.

989
01:09:07.083 --> 01:09:08.917
Peace be upon you.

990
01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:12.583
Sorry, I have to go home.

991
01:09:12.667 --> 01:09:13.917
Peace be upon you.

992
01:09:15.333 --> 01:09:16.375
Fah…

993
01:09:16.458 --> 01:09:17.917
- Yeah?
- What's wrong?

994
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.542
Not your business, Man.

995
01:09:20.667 --> 01:09:22.042
It's Gandhi, huh?

996
01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:23.625
I'll take you.

997
01:09:23.708 --> 01:09:26.875
- This isn't the time...
- Latifah, if you order a taxi,

998
01:09:26.958 --> 01:09:29.750
it'll take longer.
You're in a rush, right?

999
01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:32.333
I'll take you, okay?

1000
01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.708
Wid?

1001
01:09:41.958 --> 01:09:44.667
I have to work.
Mr. Wanto needs me for a meeting.

1002
01:09:45.583 --> 01:09:48.292
Sorry, I can't take you to the hotel.

1003
01:09:48.375 --> 01:09:49.375
I ordered a taxi.

1004
01:09:49.458 --> 01:09:51.875
Can you go back by yourself?

1005
01:09:51.958 --> 01:09:53.208
Okay.

1006
01:09:54.125 --> 01:09:56.750
- I'll let you know.
- Thank you.

1007
01:09:59.208 --> 01:10:00.208
Peace be on you.

1008
01:10:00.292 --> 01:10:01.583
Upon you too.

1009
01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:13.792
Gandhi, please eat at the table…

1010
01:10:19.042 --> 01:10:22.042
It's the usual food.
It's Gandhi's favorite.

1011
01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:25.083
- How could this be?
- I don't know, he vomited.

1012
01:10:25.167 --> 01:10:26.667
- Gandhi vomited.
- Vomit.

1013
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:29.917
If he eats,
he'll vomit after half an hour, ma'am.

1014
01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:37.042
Do you still want to vomit?

1015
01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:39.333
No? I'll make you some porridge.

1016
01:10:39.417 --> 01:10:41.750
- So you can eat.
- No…

1017
01:10:41.833 --> 01:10:43.250
Please eat, dear.

1018
01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:46.250
- You have to eat.
- No…

1019
01:10:46.333 --> 01:10:48.542
- I'll make the porridge, okay?
- No…

1020
01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:50.708
- Just a minute. Ma'am.
- No…

1021
01:10:50.792 --> 01:10:53.875
- I'll make you some porridge.
- No…

1022
01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.458
Let me make the porridge.

1023
01:11:02.042 --> 01:11:03.292
Thank you, Wid.

1024
01:11:05.667 --> 01:11:08.667
Gandhi, dear. Eat first, okay?

1025
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:12.000
Dad.

1026
01:11:13.667 --> 01:11:14.917
Dad.

1027
01:11:18.292 --> 01:11:19.542
Dad.

1028
01:11:39.125 --> 01:11:41.792
Wid. The tea.

1029
01:11:53.333 --> 01:11:54.917
Has the fever subsided?

1030
01:11:57.667 --> 01:12:00.083
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1031
01:12:10.167 --> 01:12:14.375
I heard from Arman
that Gandhi isn't yours?

1032
01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:19.208
Love doesn't have to be…

1033
01:12:24.792 --> 01:12:26.792
Blood-related, right?

1034
01:12:30.458 --> 01:12:32.417
Whatever Gandhi's condition is…

1035
01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:38.500
I'm just trying to be
a good mother to Gandhi.

1036
01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:44.708
When I was small,
I saw my mom devote her life

1037
01:12:45.875 --> 01:12:50.125
to take care of Damar and I.

1038
01:12:52.417 --> 01:12:53.958
It's not easy.

1039
01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:58.875
If I were in her position,
I might not be able to manage.

1040
01:13:01.542 --> 01:13:06.292
My late brother was also born
with special needs.

1041
01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:17.500
Mom was our home, Fah.

1042
01:13:20.667 --> 01:13:25.083
Being a mother means being ready
to sacrifice anything

1043
01:13:26.292 --> 01:13:30.042
to provide a warm and loving home.

1044
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:34.708
I don't want to wreck that home.

1045
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:42.208
I know that Arman is really happy
with you and Arum.

1046
01:13:45.792 --> 01:13:47.583
I'm sorry, Wid.

1047
01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:02.000
Do you know the consequences
of Arman marrying you?

1048
01:14:04.667 --> 01:14:06.917
Are you ready to be the second wife?

1049
01:14:15.667 --> 01:14:18.125
I can't give you an answer to that.

1050
01:14:20.958 --> 01:14:23.167
Even to myself.

1051
01:14:28.542 --> 01:14:30.125
Wid, thank you.

1052
01:14:31.792 --> 01:14:33.917
You've helped me with Gandhi.

1053
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.708
Don't mention it, Fah.

1054
01:14:39.167 --> 01:14:40.417
Gandhi…

1055
01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:45.583
We will draw more some other time, okay?

1056
01:14:45.667 --> 01:14:47.292
Gandhi and me.

1057
01:14:47.375 --> 01:14:51.375
But I need to go back
to Surabaya for now, okay?

1058
01:14:52.667 --> 01:14:54.750
No! You can't leave!

1059
01:14:54.833 --> 01:14:56.583
- Stay with me.
- Just a while.

1060
01:14:56.667 --> 01:14:59.042
- You can't leave!
- Only for a while.

1061
01:14:59.125 --> 01:15:00.208
You can't leave!

1062
01:15:00.292 --> 01:15:01.792
- Stay with me!
- Listen.

1063
01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:03.792
- You can't! Uncle and me!
- Yes…

1064
01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:06.167
- Stay here! Don't leave!
- Not for long.

1065
01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:09.292
Don't. Uncle Arman
and Aunt Widya are going home.

1066
01:15:09.375 --> 01:15:13.583
- I'm only going home for a while.
- I'm here with you, dear.

1067
01:15:13.667 --> 01:15:16.500
- Gandhi, come…
- You can't leave.

1068
01:15:16.583 --> 01:15:20.542
- Stay with me. You can't.
- Listen to me, Gandhi.

1069
01:15:20.625 --> 01:15:23.125
- You're a good boy.
- No.

1070
01:15:23.208 --> 01:15:25.083
You can't!

1071
01:15:25.167 --> 01:15:28.000
Gandhi…

1072
01:15:28.083 --> 01:15:29.958
Gandhi loves Uncle Arman?

1073
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:33.917
I love Uncle.

1074
01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:39.750
Dear, may I borrow Uncle Arman for a bit?

1075
01:15:39.833 --> 01:15:41.250
Okay?

1076
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.708
Just for a while.

1077
01:15:43.792 --> 01:15:48.875
He'll come back to play with you.
Draw with you.

1078
01:15:49.792 --> 01:15:52.375
Let me borrow him, dear. Okay?

1079
01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:05.208
Don't be sad, dear.

1080
01:16:05.292 --> 01:16:08.000
It's only for a while.

1081
01:16:08.083 --> 01:16:11.042
I promise you he won't be gone for long.

1082
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:17.500
Don't be sad, okay?

1083
01:16:22.458 --> 01:16:23.875
We'll be going now.

1084
01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:25.042
Bye, Fah.

1085
01:16:25.125 --> 01:16:27.500
- Peace be upon you.
- Upon you too.

1086
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:44.208
<i>You said you wanted to fight
for our little family.</i>

1087
01:16:45.458 --> 01:16:49.167
But at the same time,
you brought another family into our lives.

1088
01:16:54.833 --> 01:16:58.917
If you want to have
two women in your life,

1089
01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:03.042
it means you're ready to be responsible.

1090
01:17:10.667 --> 01:17:14.000
Being fair isn't judged by you, Man.

1091
01:17:15.583 --> 01:17:18.000
But by Latifah and me.

1092
01:17:25.958 --> 01:17:28.333
Thanks for letting me see Latifah.

1093
01:17:31.333 --> 01:17:36.667
Now I understand
why you want to be there for them.

1094
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:42.792
She's an independent and resilient woman.

1095
01:17:44.792 --> 01:17:48.292
I know how hard it is
to raise a kid like Gandhi.

1096
01:17:56.333 --> 01:17:58.875
You're as amazing as your mom, Wid.

1097
01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:14.292
I leave this for Gandhi.

1098
01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:18.833
I hope he likes and enjoys it.

1099
01:18:20.625 --> 01:18:25.917
As much as I hope that Arum will be happy

1100
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.208
to have Gandhi as her brother.

1101
01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.542
<i>Peace be upon you.</i>

1102
01:18:34.625 --> 01:18:39.917
- Mom!
- Arum, I missed you so much. Greetings.

1103
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.375
Where's Dad, Mom?

1104
01:18:41.458 --> 01:18:43.833
Dad is still in Bogor, dear.

1105
01:18:44.792 --> 01:18:46.167
Mom.

1106
01:18:46.792 --> 01:18:48.292
Auntie.

1107
01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:50.875
Where's Arman?

1108
01:19:01.542 --> 01:19:03.667
Thank you
for helping Gandhi and I yesterday.

1109
01:19:03.792 --> 01:19:05.625
Sorry Gandhi made Arman stay in Bogor.

1110
01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:07.167
He said he likes the porridge.

1111
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:16.042
It's fine. Arman can stay
until Gandhi is well.

1112
01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:16.958
Wid.

1113
01:19:17.083 --> 01:19:18.792
Yes, Mom?

1114
01:19:24.042 --> 01:19:26.792
Wid, what is going on?

1115
01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:28.917
Why didn't Arman return with you?

1116
01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:33.708
I will definitely tell you, Mom.

1117
01:19:33.792 --> 01:19:35.542
But not now.

1118
01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:38.833
I brought a souvenir from Bogor, Mom.
Try it.

1119
01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:58.167
The sun.

1120
01:19:58.958 --> 01:20:01.375
The sun.

1121
01:20:01.958 --> 01:20:03.458
Trees.

1122
01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:08.042
The sun…

1123
01:20:10.792 --> 01:20:15.250
It hurts… It hurts…

1124
01:20:15.333 --> 01:20:16.750
Draw…

1125
01:20:16.833 --> 01:20:19.792
Draw!

1126
01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:22.792
Gandhi, it's me. How did this happen?

1127
01:20:22.875 --> 01:20:24.750
I wanted to help, ma'am.

1128
01:20:24.833 --> 01:20:26.000
But he was enraged.

1129
01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:28.708
- Draw…
- It's okay, I'm here now.

1130
01:20:28.792 --> 01:20:29.917
Thank you.

1131
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.500
Sure.

1132
01:20:32.042 --> 01:20:33.583
Yes, Fah.

1133
01:20:33.667 --> 01:20:34.917
Upon you too.

1134
01:20:36.625 --> 01:20:38.917
God is the greatest.

1135
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.875
Latifah can't come, honey.

1136
01:20:40.958 --> 01:20:44.750
Gandhi has been throwing tantrums.
He just fell off his bike.

1137
01:20:44.833 --> 01:20:46.750
How can he fall?

1138
01:20:47.458 --> 01:20:49.250
So how's Gandhi now?

1139
01:20:49.333 --> 01:20:52.375
He's fine. Only a small scratch.

1140
01:20:52.458 --> 01:20:54.500
But the tantrum is still going.

1141
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.458
Poor Gandhi.

1142
01:20:58.125 --> 01:21:02.917
Who takes care of Gandhi
with Latifah? Mrs. Sum?

1143
01:21:03.375 --> 01:21:08.667
There's Mr. Supri too. But he went home
to his family in his hometown

1144
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:11.125
because they're coming to Surabaya.

1145
01:21:11.208 --> 01:21:14.708
And if Gandhi needs to go to the clinic?
Who'll take them?

1146
01:21:15.333 --> 01:21:17.375
Arum…

1147
01:21:17.458 --> 01:21:19.625
Arum, please stop crying.

1148
01:21:22.792 --> 01:21:25.917
Grandma is preparing your birthday cake.

1149
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.875
I saw the cake, it's so pretty.

1150
01:21:29.375 --> 01:21:31.250
Do you want to help Grandma?

1151
01:21:32.667 --> 01:21:35.750
Okay, I'll help Grandma.

1152
01:21:35.833 --> 01:21:39.708
Preparing my cake for my friends.

1153
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.292
Don't cry anymore, okay?

1154
01:21:58.125 --> 01:21:59.583
Wid.

1155
01:22:01.167 --> 01:22:02.333
Where's Arman?

1156
01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.250
Gandhi is fine.

1157
01:22:05.917 --> 01:22:09.333
It's Arum's birthday. She needs her dad,
she'll be upset.

1158
01:22:10.042 --> 01:22:13.542
I told you already.
Widya and I had agreed.

1159
01:22:13.625 --> 01:22:14.875
Latifah.

1160
01:22:15.417 --> 01:22:17.875
I came here to take care of you.

1161
01:22:20.167 --> 01:22:21.542
- I...
- Widya asked me...

1162
01:22:21.625 --> 01:22:26.458
Right, Widya asked you, but I'm asking you
to go back to Surabaya now.

1163
01:22:27.458 --> 01:22:29.000
<i>Mom…</i>

1164
01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:31.625
I know choosing is tough.

1165
01:22:35.792 --> 01:22:37.917
So, I have decided

1166
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.625
that Arman mustn't choose
between me or Latifah.

1167
01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:43.125
What do you mean?

1168
01:22:45.458 --> 01:22:46.958
I care about you Fah.

1169
01:22:47.792 --> 01:22:49.583
Gandhi's condition is crucial.

1170
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.375
I'm his mother, Man.

1171
01:22:53.458 --> 01:22:56.375
Gandhi has his mom and Mrs. Sum here.

1172
01:22:56.458 --> 01:22:58.917
I can take him to the hospital myself.

1173
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.792
I won't just do nothing.

1174
01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.792
Arum needs her father now.

1175
01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:05.792
- It's her birthday.
- I don't understand your thinking.

1176
01:23:05.875 --> 01:23:08.333
I don't understand <i>your</i> thinking.

1177
01:23:10.167 --> 01:23:12.542
<i>I met Latifah and Gandhi, Mom.</i>

1178
01:23:13.333 --> 01:23:16.708
Now I understand
why Arman wants to protect them.

1179
01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:19.750
They need a family too, Mom.

1180
01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:22.500
Wid…

1181
01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:27.167
I know Latifah very well, Wid.

1182
01:23:27.958 --> 01:23:29.750
Latifah is selfish.

1183
01:23:29.833 --> 01:23:33.292
She only thinks of her ambitions
and not her family.

1184
01:23:34.292 --> 01:23:37.625
Can you be fair, Man?

1185
01:23:40.792 --> 01:23:42.875
Widya might be able to accept it.

1186
01:23:44.583 --> 01:23:46.000
But not me.

1187
01:23:48.833 --> 01:23:51.125
I feel very bad, Man.

1188
01:23:51.208 --> 01:23:53.167
Do you remember Damar?

1189
01:23:54.167 --> 01:23:55.625
Your brother?

1190
01:23:56.417 --> 01:23:58.458
Your late brother, right?

1191
01:24:00.208 --> 01:24:04.167
I know how troublesome it was
to take care of Damar, Mom.

1192
01:24:08.417 --> 01:24:11.042
My mom had to sacrifice everything
for Damar.

1193
01:24:12.125 --> 01:24:15.208
And when I saw
Latifah and Gandhi yesterday,

1194
01:24:16.458 --> 01:24:20.458
it felt like I was seeing
my mom with Damar again, Mom.

1195
01:24:24.875 --> 01:24:28.042
<i>I wish I had been
more supportive of my mom.</i>

1196
01:24:28.833 --> 01:24:32.500
<i>I wish I had never asked
for fairness from my mom.</i>

1197
01:24:35.792 --> 01:24:39.708
<i>I wish I had never been ashamed
of Damar's condition, Mom.</i>

1198
01:24:41.875 --> 01:24:46.000
<i>I wish I had been more careful
and helped my mom take care of Damar,</i>

1199
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.042
Damar and my mom
would still be around, Mom.

1200
01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:55.542
That accident wouldn't have happened.

1201
01:24:59.333 --> 01:25:00.583
I'm sorry.

1202
01:25:01.792 --> 01:25:03.042
I'll go.

1203
01:25:04.125 --> 01:25:06.917
I know the situation will be bad
if I stay here.

1204
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.042
It will go on like this.
The arguing will persist.

1205
01:25:11.333 --> 01:25:13.625
<i>This is also God's will, Mom.</i>

1206
01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:18.083
I'm sure God wanted me
to meet Latifah and Gandhi

1207
01:25:18.167 --> 01:25:20.958
so I can make up for my mistakes.

1208
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:25.833
I also don't know what the future will be,

1209
01:25:25.917 --> 01:25:28.792
but what I do know now

1210
01:25:28.875 --> 01:25:32.875
is that God gave me this path
for me to reach heaven's door, Mom.

1211
01:25:34.458 --> 01:25:36.458
Arman too.

1212
01:25:40.542 --> 01:25:41.708
Peace be on you.

1213
01:25:41.792 --> 01:25:43.333
Dad!

1214
01:25:43.417 --> 01:25:45.708
My lovely daughter.

1215
01:25:47.083 --> 01:25:48.292
- Fah.
- Wid.

1216
01:25:48.375 --> 01:25:50.250
You are finally here.

1217
01:25:51.625 --> 01:25:53.292
- Mrs. Sum.
- Ma'am.

1218
01:25:53.458 --> 01:25:54.958
Gandhi.

1219
01:25:56.750 --> 01:26:00.333
This is Arum. Arum, this is Aunt Latifah.

1220
01:26:00.417 --> 01:26:02.250
Hello, dear.

1221
01:26:02.333 --> 01:26:04.083
This is Mrs. Sum.

1222
01:26:05.167 --> 01:26:07.542
This is Gandhi who video-called you.

1223
01:26:07.625 --> 01:26:10.208
Hi, I'm Arum, do you remember me?

1224
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Give greetings, dear.

1225
01:26:13.375 --> 01:26:17.042
I have a bike.
Do you want to ride the bike with me?

1226
01:26:17.125 --> 01:26:19.042
Bike!

1227
01:26:19.125 --> 01:26:21.708
- Bike!
- Okay. Let's go ride the bike.

1228
01:26:21.792 --> 01:26:23.875
Be careful with your bike, Arum.

1229
01:26:23.958 --> 01:26:24.875
Watch them.

1230
01:26:24.958 --> 01:26:27.000
Gandhi, careful. Ma'am, watch them.

1231
01:26:28.333 --> 01:26:29.583
Ma'am.

1232
01:26:37.208 --> 01:26:38.458
Ma'am…

1233
01:26:41.458 --> 01:26:42.958
How are you, ma'am?

1234
01:26:46.458 --> 01:26:47.792
Thank God, I'm well.

1235
01:26:50.125 --> 01:26:51.417
I'm good.

1236
01:27:00.333 --> 01:27:03.875
Gandhi was tired
from riding the bike, Mom.

1237
01:27:03.958 --> 01:27:06.167
So, he went to sleep with Mrs. Sum.

1238
01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:09.542
That's fine. Gandhi's tired
from the trip from Bogor.

1239
01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:14.250
Okay then, I want to try
my favorite souvenir from Bogor.

1240
01:27:14.333 --> 01:27:17.958
- Sure, try it.
- Which one do you want? There's cake…

1241
01:27:20.458 --> 01:27:22.292
This is Lapis Bogor.

1242
01:27:22.375 --> 01:27:24.167
There are crackers too.

1243
01:27:24.250 --> 01:27:26.917
- There are sticks.
- Which one do you want?

1244
01:27:41.375 --> 01:27:43.292
Ma'am, do you need any help?

1245
01:27:46.125 --> 01:27:47.125
No need.

1246
01:27:53.333 --> 01:27:57.333
Please forgive me if I created
an unpleasant atmosphere in this house.

1247
01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:01.375
I don't want to wreck this family, ma'am.

1248
01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:09.167
But every time I'm with Arman and Widya,

1249
01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:13.167
I feel like I have a family, ma'am.

1250
01:28:20.583 --> 01:28:22.875
I feel complete, ma'am.

1251
01:28:24.958 --> 01:28:26.583
Not lonely anymore.

1252
01:28:30.833 --> 01:28:31.833
Ma'am…

1253
01:28:32.833 --> 01:28:35.875
Whatever mistakes I made in the past

1254
01:28:36.667 --> 01:28:38.875
and make in the future,

1255
01:28:40.792 --> 01:28:42.458
please forgive me, ma'am.

1256
01:30:05.542 --> 01:30:07.625
Are you okay, honey?

1257
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.792
Why are you asking that?

1258
01:30:17.417 --> 01:30:18.583
Today, it's,

1259
01:30:20.083 --> 01:30:21.333
I'm going to…

1260
01:30:25.125 --> 01:30:28.708
Everything we're going through now
is between us and God.

1261
01:30:33.667 --> 01:30:36.667
I'm happy Latifah is destined
to be our family

1262
01:30:38.667 --> 01:30:40.792
and, God willing, I'm sincere.

1263
01:30:47.958 --> 01:30:50.125
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

1264
01:30:50.958 --> 01:30:52.583
Ma'am.

1265
01:30:55.417 --> 01:30:56.750
It's Gandhi, ma'am.

1266
01:30:56.833 --> 01:30:58.542
Gandhi isn't in his room.

1267
01:30:58.625 --> 01:31:00.792
- What?
- I can't find him. He's gone.

1268
01:31:00.875 --> 01:31:02.000
I can't find him.

1269
01:31:02.083 --> 01:31:04.000
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

1270
01:31:04.083 --> 01:31:05.500
And Arum is gone too.

1271
01:31:05.583 --> 01:31:07.792
Her bike is missing, ma'am.

1272
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.125
- Fah.
- Wid.

1273
01:31:10.208 --> 01:31:11.875
Man? Where's Gandhi?

1274
01:31:11.958 --> 01:31:14.667
Okay, please calm down. Calm down.

1275
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:17.083
I'll look for Gandhi with Mr. Supri.

1276
01:31:17.167 --> 01:31:20.083
- You stay here, okay?
- I can't stay here.

1277
01:31:20.167 --> 01:31:22.917
- He's gone, I need to find him.
- I'll go.

1278
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.167
- I'll go.
- Yeah.

1279
01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:26.750
Everyone, calm down. Wait, okay?

1280
01:31:26.833 --> 01:31:28.125
We'll use the car.

1281
01:31:28.208 --> 01:31:29.292
We have to go.

1282
01:31:33.208 --> 01:31:36.417
<i>Why is Dad marrying Aunt Latifah, Mom?</i>

1283
01:31:37.167 --> 01:31:40.667
Aunt Latifah is going to marry Dad.

1284
01:31:41.667 --> 01:31:44.917
After that,
Gandhi will become your brother.

1285
01:31:50.333 --> 01:31:52.042
Where are you going?

1286
01:31:52.125 --> 01:31:55.125
You're not going to die, right?

1287
01:31:55.208 --> 01:31:58.083
Why did you ask that, dear?

1288
01:31:58.167 --> 01:32:02.417
<i>My friend, Nada, has a new mom</i>

1289
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:06.083
<i>because her mom died.</i>

1290
01:32:06.625 --> 01:32:12.292
<i>If I had a new mom,
I don't want you to die.</i>

1291
01:32:12.375 --> 01:32:15.958
<i>No, Arum…</i>

1292
01:32:23.625 --> 01:32:26.208
Dad! You can't!

1293
01:32:26.292 --> 01:32:28.792
- Gandhi!
- Dad! You can't.

1294
01:32:28.875 --> 01:32:33.083
<i>- Dad! You can't.
- We'll put it up again.</i>

1295
01:32:33.167 --> 01:32:36.125
- Dad! You can't.
- We'll put it up again.

1296
01:32:36.208 --> 01:32:37.917
You can't!

1297
01:32:38.458 --> 01:32:44.583
Dad…

1298
01:32:45.833 --> 01:32:47.833
<i>You can't. Dad…</i>

1299
01:33:04.375 --> 01:33:07.125
- Wid, that's Gandhi's bike.
- Where?

1300
01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:09.208
Here, Fah.

1301
01:33:22.833 --> 01:33:23.708
Honey…

1302
01:33:23.792 --> 01:33:27.542
You're a boy. You have to love your mom.

1303
01:33:27.625 --> 01:33:30.292
A boy must take care of his mother.

1304
01:33:30.375 --> 01:33:32.042
- Mom.
- Love.

1305
01:33:32.125 --> 01:33:33.750
- Love.
- Mom.

1306
01:33:33.833 --> 01:33:35.917
- Mom.
- The dino?

1307
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.125
- Dino.
- Okay.

1308
01:33:40.833 --> 01:33:42.958
- Dino.
- Dino.

1309
01:33:56.125 --> 01:33:58.000
Gandhi, Arum.

1310
01:33:58.083 --> 01:33:59.333
Arum.

1311
01:34:00.792 --> 01:34:02.292
Mom.

1312
01:34:03.042 --> 01:34:04.583
Arum, Mom.

1313
01:34:05.625 --> 01:34:08.042
Please forgive me, Mom.

1314
01:34:08.125 --> 01:34:09.667
It's okay, dear.

1315
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:13.542
Forgive Arum for making you worry.

1316
01:34:13.625 --> 01:34:16.625
No, dear. It's okay.

1317
01:34:25.333 --> 01:34:26.333
Arum.

1318
01:34:26.917 --> 01:34:30.042
Please forgive me…

1319
01:34:30.125 --> 01:34:34.167
Please forgive me

1320
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:39.375
for making you worry.

1321
01:34:42.125 --> 01:34:43.833
Arum, dear.

1322
01:34:48.833 --> 01:34:51.167
I'm the one who needs to apologize to you.

1323
01:34:53.208 --> 01:34:55.042
Please forgive me.

1324
01:34:58.792 --> 01:35:00.875
I love you.

1325
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.208
I also love you and Gandhi.

1326
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:09.417
I want to have a brother like Gandhi.

1327
01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:13.458
I don't want to lose Gandhi,

1328
01:35:13.542 --> 01:35:18.542
but I also don't want to lose my mom.

1329
01:35:18.625 --> 01:35:20.375
No, dear.

1330
01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:27.250
Dear, listen to me.

1331
01:35:30.167 --> 01:35:34.500
You won't lose the people you love.

1332
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.667
Trust me.

1333
01:36:14.375 --> 01:36:15.833
Fah, it's going to start.

1334
01:36:17.125 --> 01:36:19.875
Honey, she's still inside?

1335
01:36:19.958 --> 01:36:21.292
She's not answering.

1336
01:36:23.833 --> 01:36:25.083
Fah…

1337
01:36:33.208 --> 01:36:35.042
- Are you ready?
- Come on, Fah.

1338
01:36:35.125 --> 01:36:37.125
Wid, Man…

1339
01:36:38.083 --> 01:36:39.500
I want to talk.

1340
01:37:03.792 --> 01:37:05.708
I'm grateful to have you both.

1341
01:37:09.042 --> 01:37:10.292
Wid.

1342
01:37:11.958 --> 01:37:14.292
You can accept me and Gandhi.

1343
01:37:18.042 --> 01:37:19.292
Man.

1344
01:37:21.292 --> 01:37:23.958
You can be Gandhi's father figure.

1345
01:37:29.083 --> 01:37:31.750
Fah, what is this about?

1346
01:37:39.458 --> 01:37:44.583
Marriage is not about what we want.

1347
01:37:51.333 --> 01:37:54.125
Let's sit. Let's talk while we sit.

1348
01:38:03.792 --> 01:38:07.042
Wid… Marriage is about

1349
01:38:09.958 --> 01:38:12.375
finding God's paradise.

1350
01:38:16.958 --> 01:38:20.875
And I don't want that paradise
to turn into hell for us.

1351
01:38:24.458 --> 01:38:27.708
There are many paths
leading toward heaven's door.

1352
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.042
Maybe this isn't my path.

1353
01:38:42.833 --> 01:38:44.458
Arman…

1354
01:38:47.125 --> 01:38:51.167
I'm sure you will treat me
and Widya the same.

1355
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:56.000
There's no first wife.

1356
01:38:57.458 --> 01:38:59.417
There's no second wife.

1357
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:03.083
We are wives.

1358
01:39:18.417 --> 01:39:22.250
This decision is purely mine.

1359
01:39:27.083 --> 01:39:29.583
I've been wanting to say this for a while

1360
01:39:30.625 --> 01:39:33.042
but I didn't have the courage to do so.

1361
01:39:36.792 --> 01:39:39.625
I don't want to lose my family.

1362
01:39:40.583 --> 01:39:43.042
You are my new family.

1363
01:39:53.083 --> 01:39:56.917
The more I see the sincerity from you,

1364
01:40:00.375 --> 01:40:03.667
the more I'm not sure about this marriage.

1365
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.500
Are you sure
this is the best for you, Fah?

1366
01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.750
Widya.

1367
01:40:40.417 --> 01:40:42.333
Please forgive me.

1368
01:40:47.333 --> 01:40:48.750
It's not that.

1369
01:40:49.625 --> 01:40:51.417
You don't have to apologize.

1370
01:40:52.625 --> 01:40:54.417
I'm also a woman, Fah.

1371
01:40:55.917 --> 01:40:57.667
I understand.

1372
01:41:02.583 --> 01:41:05.542
But one thing you need to remember…

1373
01:41:06.458 --> 01:41:09.500
Whether this marriage happens or not,

1374
01:41:11.250 --> 01:41:12.958
we're still your family.

1375
01:41:14.208 --> 01:41:16.917
Me. Arman.

1376
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.500
Arum.

1377
01:41:19.458 --> 01:41:22.083
We'll always be there for you and Gandhi.

1378
01:41:33.083 --> 01:41:35.042
Thank you, Wid.

1379
01:41:37.458 --> 01:41:40.042
You have such a big heart.

1380
01:41:41.333 --> 01:41:42.833
Please forgive me.

1381
01:41:44.792 --> 01:41:46.458
Forgive me, Wid.

1382
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.792
<i>Please forgive me.
I brought you into this path.</i>

1383
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.667
<i>I've hurt you.</i>

1384
01:42:16.833 --> 01:42:19.792
<i>I got you into a difficult situation.</i>

1385
01:42:21.625 --> 01:42:23.292
<i>This is the way, Man.</i>

1386
01:42:24.583 --> 01:42:26.708
<i>There's nothing to regret.</i>

1387
01:42:27.792 --> 01:42:32.875
<i>What happened between you, me and Latifah,</i>

1388
01:42:33.458 --> 01:42:36.625
<i>that was our way to get closer to God.</i>

1389
01:42:38.375 --> 01:42:42.292
<i>Let's… turn a new page, okay?</i>

1390
01:42:43.833 --> 01:42:45.667
<i>And fill the story…</i>

1391
01:42:48.042 --> 01:42:50.167
<i>With happiness.</i>

1392
01:43:02.333 --> 01:43:05.958
<i>Even though Arman and I
didn't get married,</i>

1393
01:43:06.042 --> 01:43:09.083
<i>we'll still be a family who looks out for</i>

1394
01:43:09.167 --> 01:43:11.375
<i>each other with care.</i>

1395
01:43:16.375 --> 01:43:18.833
- Blow out the candles!
- Blow it first.
