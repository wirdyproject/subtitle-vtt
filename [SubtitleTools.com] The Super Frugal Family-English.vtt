00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:48.791
Sir, join us for lunch downstairs.

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:52.083
Don't you get bored of eating alone?

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.416
Where are you guys going?

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:57.958
Don't tell me it's Geprek Spesial again.

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.541
Right? Your stomachs
and wallets must be suffering.

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:03.583
I've got my lunch.

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:05.791
Simple rations.

00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.833
Packed lunch again? Are you a schoolboy?

00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:11.208
No lunch money from your wife?

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:15.208
It keeps you healthy,
physically and financially.

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.625
Good nutrition, happy wife.

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:19.916
Healthy life, huh?

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:21.458
Wait.

00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.166
New photo?

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.625
When did you go abroad?
I never see you take leave.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.083
I made it myself, Bram.

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:28.750
Studio's expensive.

00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:30.666
We have advanced tech.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.000
France, London, Egypt.

00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:38.541
Maybe it'll happen one day. Amen.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.083

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:15.666
Lin?

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.875
Honey. The rent is due next week.

00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:23.250
If we're late,
the landlord will bother Maya again.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.500
Tony. Do you have a minute to talk?

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:28.041
Yes, sir.

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:31.208
We can talk as long as you want.
It's the same rate.

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:39.291
So we agree, sir?

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:41.250
Thirty-five, ma'am.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:43.833
But it's different.
This is noon, not morning.

00:02:43.916 --> 00:02:45.916
You can tell the freshness is different.

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:47.625
Hey.

00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:51.375
I assure you
it'll still be fresh by this afternoon.

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:54.375
I've already dropped the price by 30%.

00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:57.708
Thirty percent of one kilogram of mackerel

00:02:57.791 --> 00:03:01.666
priced at Rp45,000 is Rp13,500.

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:04.000
Not Rp10,000.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.291
This is basic math.

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.666
You shouldn't interrupt while I'm reading.

KENNY SUKAHARTA, A GENIUS
FRUGAL SCORE: 95%

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:18.500
Make it Rp20,000.
And I'll take some pomfret fish.

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.583
At that size, they just get stuck
between your teeth.

00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:24.750
Pomfret fish are this size.
If you want bigger, get a dugong.

00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:29.000
Rp30,000 is a good deal.
I've chased others off for less.

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.958
Okay, fine. Don't look at me like that.

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:35.958
Wait! I want a kilogram of clean cuts.

00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:41.458
No bones, head, or guts. Just the meat.

00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.291
Right as I was about to close too?

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:46.458
Use my scale.

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:48.166
Okay, fine!

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:53.083

-Thank you, sis! Bye-bye!
-Bye!

00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:00.708
-Post it on your story, okay?
-Okay.

SALLY SUKAHARTA, FAMILY STAR
FRUGAL LEVEL: 80%

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:08.875
Want this? Only Rp10,000.

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:09.958
Nope.

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:14.750
BILLY SUKAHARTA, FAMILY BURDEN
FRUGAL LEVEL: 100% WASTEFUL

00:04:16.916 --> 00:04:19.750
Who is this? I don't know any of them.

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:21.375
No soccer players?

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:23.333
Didn't you ask Mom for allowance?

00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:28.875
No way. I got lectured for an hour
just asking for Rp2,000 yesterday.

00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.416
Rp10,000?

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:33.000
I'd be in big trouble.

00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:44.833
Bil, do you think the boys would buy
if I make it with soccer players?

00:04:44.916 --> 00:04:47.541
Dunno. I don't know a thing about soccer.

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:48.458
What?

00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:50.291
Then why did you ask?

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.958
That was the best.

00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.458
Amazing.

00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:07.458
-So good.
-It's like the meat bites back!

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:09.833
You ate all the cucumbers too.

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:12.041
-Too spicy. My tongue can't handle it.
-Try it again.

00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:14.875
-Mr. Tony.
-What's wrong?

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:16.250
You good?

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.583
Sir.

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:23.208
Try something sweet.
You always drink coffee,

00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:25.541
your aura is turning bitter too.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:26.875
Have some snacks too.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.875
Sir, were you speaking with the boss?

00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.833
I heard they're cutting staff?

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:37.208
But Mr. Tony, of all people?
No way. He's a senior.

00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:39.291
And he's in Finance, that's essential.

00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:41.583
They're not cutting me.

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:43.625
Thank God.

00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:45.541
I just had to choose,

00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:48.333
take a pay cut or resign.

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:54.041
-I'd leave if I were you.
-Right.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.916
All those years working here,
and they don't respect you.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.541
It's not just me,

00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:01.791
it's all of us.

00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:05.208
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:18.708
Seriously, those kids make
50 million rupiah a month?

00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:20.750
And without the parents controlling it?

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:23.208
I could dance like that too, no problem.

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.500
It's hit-or-miss.

00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:27.666
Depending on what's popular.

00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:29.625
There's no guarantee.

00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:32.791
What about our guarantee?
Picking up trash?

00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:35.333
Saving up? Fasting?

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:38.833
The ones benefiting from that
are Mom and Dad, not us.

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:40.458
Then you should tell them.

00:06:42.416 --> 00:06:44.333
She'll make me fast for a month.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.875
Are you done with that?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.625
Thanks.

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:05.416
What I'm saying is,
getting rich today is easy,

00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:08.916
work smart, not hard.

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:20.250
How did you spot that?

00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:23.041
Work smarter, sis.

00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:29.291
Mom, the outlets are full.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.708
Looks like you'll have to sacrifice

00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:35.541
a few hundred watts
of electricity at home.

00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:38.583
I'll take care of it.

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:40.583
Excuse me, Mrs. Linda.

00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:44.708
There's a free lemon tester

00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:47.916
at the supermarket. Remind me later.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.958
Mrs. Linda, excuse me.

00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:55.250
We're out of outlets.
Can I borrow another? Thanks.

00:07:56.166 --> 00:07:57.958
Okay… Wait, ma'am…

00:07:58.041 --> 00:07:59.166
Are you almost done?

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.250
The other kids are waiting.

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:06.291
-Come on now.
-She's taking so long.

Mr. Martino.

When I look at the browser history,

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:19.416
the sites visited most often
are gambling, hacking,

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.375
and… porn.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.791
I'm not accusing anyone,
but if something happens,

00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:29.791
our district could be in trouble.

00:08:33.666 --> 00:08:35.750
Everyone, go home! Leave!

My office is five kilometers
away from home.

00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:24.291
It's doable by bike, why use a motorcycle?

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:28.166
Hang on. We've been through this already.

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:35.833
I know, but the motorcycle
has always drained our money.

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:39.750
So I'm the only one who has to suffer?

00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:43.416
If we go through with the bike plan,

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:48.041

It's refreshing.

00:10:18.791 --> 00:10:19.750
Wait.

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:21.708
Why are you adding water?

00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:23.416
So we have plenty.

00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:28.125
Give it a try before you say anything.

00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:30.916
Didn't you say you were feeling hot?

00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:39.208
A statue, really? Like you could make one.

00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:41.333
It's not that hard.

00:10:41.416 --> 00:10:42.916
It's a subtractive approach.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.041
I'm still visualizing it,

00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:48.333
then it's just geometry
and finding the right medium.

00:10:48.416 --> 00:10:51.541
Might as well make a pyramid,
like the pharaoh.

00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:53.500
So fussy.

00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:55.916
That's nice. I like it.

00:10:56.541 --> 00:10:57.750
Hey.

00:10:57.833 --> 00:10:59.541
One glass per person.

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:01.500
You only gave me half earlier.

00:11:01.583 --> 00:11:02.458
I swear.

00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:05.208
You can have more next time.

-And upon you peace.

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:09.416
-Dad!
-Hi, Dad.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.041
I read that physical touch is crucial
not just for a child's growth,

00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:25.208
but also for the mental
and emotional health of the parents.

00:11:26.916 --> 00:11:27.916
Thanks.

00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:33.541
It's almost year-end.

00:11:34.916 --> 00:11:38.333
Dad should be getting his bonus soon.
Let's plan a vacation.

00:11:38.416 --> 00:11:40.750
Bali's getting old. Somewhere else?

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:44.958
Okay. Kenny, you choose.
Where do you wanna go?

00:11:45.041 --> 00:11:46.958
Maybe we can revisit the route

00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:50.958
of General Sudirman's guerrilla operation
alongside the Allied forces.

00:11:53.541 --> 00:11:57.125
-I think Bali's fine.
-Yeah, let's do Bali.

00:11:58.208 --> 00:11:59.833
We're going to Bali, right, honey?

00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:02.041
Bali is too windy right now.

00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:03.291
What?

00:12:04.041 --> 00:12:06.125
I should go

00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:09.041
and change.

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:14.916
Listen.

00:12:16.791 --> 00:12:18.208
Please listen first.

00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:20.000
-Okay.
-Hear me out.

00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:23.333
I was shocked.

00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:26.916
I'm… not ready.

00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:30.250
To…

00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.333
Okay, and?

00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:35.666
I know I should've consulted you first.

00:12:36.541 --> 00:12:38.208
Right? Basically,

00:12:39.541 --> 00:12:43.291
for now, I accepted the pay cut.

00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:48.791
But it's temporary. Okay?

00:12:49.791 --> 00:12:54.791
If I… resign,

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:59.333
who knows when I'll get a new job?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.833
It's better to be safe, right?

00:13:05.916 --> 00:13:08.125
No, it's not like that.

00:13:12.916 --> 00:13:14.583
How much is the pay cut?

00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:21.041
What?!

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:25.416
Nah, never mind.

00:13:26.666 --> 00:13:28.041
Eight million?

00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:35.333
Rent is five million.
Three million for food.

00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:39.083
Water, electricity, school fees, Internet,

00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:43.041
community fees, trash, and transportation?

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:49.166
Forget about getting Kenny
into a top school.

00:13:56.666 --> 00:14:00.416
What do we do if that's still
your pay next month?

00:14:01.916 --> 00:14:02.791
And…

00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:08.166
that's not all.

00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:11.000
What were we thinking back then?

00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:14.416
This…

00:14:15.916 --> 00:14:17.166
This feels like

00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:19.416
a sin.

00:14:22.791 --> 00:14:25.541
I feel like I'm being punished.

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:29.375
But we meant well.

00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:42.916
We should give Maya a call.

00:14:57.125 --> 00:15:00.041
Let's talk here. My kids are asleep.

00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:03.416
Sure. Let's stay here.

00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:05.666
Lin.

00:15:09.166 --> 00:15:12.958
I know this is sudden…

00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:16.333
Yeah, we have unexpected news too.
It's an emergency.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:17.541
Who's going first?

00:15:18.041 --> 00:15:19.208
Listen…

00:15:19.291 --> 00:15:20.208
Maya.

00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:26.416
Can we push the rent payment
to next month?

00:15:27.916 --> 00:15:30.791
But it's not that
we'll double it next month,

00:15:31.416 --> 00:15:32.333
we'll still pay--

00:15:32.416 --> 00:15:34.125
My husband is going through a tough time.

00:15:34.208 --> 00:15:35.125
Gosh.

00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:37.291
His salary was cut.

00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:39.875
-I can't say anything.
-That's why

00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.541
I called you. I wanted to tell you that.

00:15:43.458 --> 00:15:44.375
Lin.

00:15:44.458 --> 00:15:50.916
The landlord is trying
to marry off his daughter,

00:15:51.916 --> 00:15:52.875
a spinster.

00:15:53.916 --> 00:15:55.666
While he has a chance.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.375
So he wanted to pay for the wedding.

00:16:00.041 --> 00:16:01.416
That's why…

00:16:04.375 --> 00:16:05.916
Yeah, go on.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.541
He's asking you to pay rent

00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:13.458
for the year.

00:16:17.041 --> 00:16:18.166
Otherwise,

00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:21.666
he'll rent it to someone else.

00:16:25.458 --> 00:16:26.500
We can't.

00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:30.375
May.

00:16:31.666 --> 00:16:35.875
Look, take your time to think it over.

00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.083
We have.

00:16:37.166 --> 00:16:43.041
But if you can't pay
by the end of the month,

00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:46.916
I won't be able to help anymore, sorry.

00:16:49.166 --> 00:16:50.250
Well, then.

00:17:17.041 --> 00:17:21.541
I remember how much
we struggled to find this house.

00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:29.666
We almost felt like giving up.

00:17:31.666 --> 00:17:32.541
But then

00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:38.250
we found this diamond in the rough.

00:17:41.666 --> 00:17:43.541
The building is good,

00:17:44.583 --> 00:17:46.291
the environment is peaceful.

00:17:49.791 --> 00:17:54.416
How did it perfectly fit
our budget back then?

00:18:23.916 --> 00:18:25.166
I'll fix it tomorrow.

00:18:30.916 --> 00:18:32.291
For what?

00:18:38.416 --> 00:18:40.208
Come on, now.

00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:42.291
We'll find a way.

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:47.291
Don't cry.
The kids will think we're fighting.

00:18:49.125 --> 00:18:50.250
It's okay.

00:18:51.166 --> 00:18:52.583
It's okay.

00:18:53.125 --> 00:18:54.250
It's okay.

00:19:17.416 --> 00:19:20.583
Dad wanted to tell you all something.
Listen to him.

00:19:21.166 --> 00:19:25.916
I work hard for all of you.

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:31.666
There are moments when,
despite all the effort,

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:36.083
giving our all, sometimes it's just--

00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:37.291
His salary was cut.

00:19:41.291 --> 00:19:42.458
It's a huge cut.

00:19:43.541 --> 00:19:45.833
His pay has been halved
from what it usually is.

00:19:45.916 --> 00:19:49.708
Which means we can't
spend recklessly as before.

00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:54.458
But we never spend recklessly.

00:19:55.166 --> 00:20:00.041
We're like the most extreme
cheapskate family ever.

00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:05.416
Why turn the fan up so high? Set it lower.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.166
No need to have it at full speed.

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:10.833
It's wasting electricity
and could give you a cold.

00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:14.125
Go take a shower. You'll feel better.

00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:17.375
I've set aside the water.

00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:20.333
It's being frugal.

00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:24.208
Imagine there's a line between

00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:26.000
being frugal and being cheap.

00:20:26.541 --> 00:20:29.083
We're swinging right in the middle.

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:33.500
Dad.

00:20:34.583 --> 00:20:36.833
I have some savings.

00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:41.166
If needed, I'm fine
with getting a side job,

00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:44.625
aside from selling K-pop merchandise.

00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:48.291
No, Sal.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.625
And one more thing.

00:20:52.708 --> 00:20:56.041
Your mom and I have decided

00:20:56.541 --> 00:20:59.708
that we should move out.

00:21:03.416 --> 00:21:05.666
Billy, you're right.

00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:08.083
We've been living frugally all this time.

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.333
And now,

00:21:09.875 --> 00:21:13.500
let's try to cut back even more.

00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:15.541
See?

00:21:16.666 --> 00:21:18.250
It's happening.

00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:20.416
We've ended up poor.

00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:23.291
We were never rich.

00:21:23.791 --> 00:21:25.291
What do you mean "ended up"?

00:21:26.541 --> 00:21:29.291
Moving suddenly like this

00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:32.666
is going to impact my mental health.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:36.791
It'll be hard to focus on my studies.
So if my grades drop,

00:21:36.875 --> 00:21:39.166
I hope you can understand.

00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:50.500
I don't understand. What?

00:21:50.583 --> 00:21:54.791
Life is like coffee.

00:21:54.875 --> 00:21:57.791
-Coffee.
-If we don't learn to enjoy it,

00:21:58.416 --> 00:22:01.041
all we'll taste is bitterness.

00:22:03.541 --> 00:22:07.000
You know-it-all.
Have you even had coffee before?

00:22:07.083 --> 00:22:10.458
I don't mind moving,
as long as I have my cupboard.

00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:17.291
Whatever problems come our way,
if we face it as a family,

00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:20.333
we'll overcome it.

00:22:25.416 --> 00:22:26.291
We must.

00:22:28.416 --> 00:22:29.291
Have faith.

00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:31.250
We must.

00:22:41.541 --> 00:22:43.625
-It's pouring hard.
-Right.

00:22:43.708 --> 00:22:45.666
-Raincoat!
-I'm going to be late.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.166
I'll go get it.

00:22:48.666 --> 00:22:49.583
Oh, no.

00:22:50.541 --> 00:22:53.916
We should take a taxi if we
want to make it on time in this rain.

00:23:00.541 --> 00:23:05.333
I'll find us a cheaper place to live.

00:23:05.416 --> 00:23:07.541
Probably smaller than this one,

00:23:08.416 --> 00:23:10.083
but it's temporary.

00:23:10.166 --> 00:23:14.083
Let's stay frugal, keep saving,

00:23:14.166 --> 00:23:17.791
and work hard until we have enough

00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:20.041
to move back into this house.

00:23:33.166 --> 00:23:34.416
Honey, what do you think?

00:23:40.416 --> 00:23:42.666
It's too far

00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:44.791
above our budget.

00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:56.041
Well?

00:23:56.666 --> 00:23:58.083
It's too exposed.

00:23:58.166 --> 00:24:00.250
Yeah, it's new.

00:24:00.333 --> 00:24:02.083
The guy was smiling at me.

00:24:02.166 --> 00:24:03.833
Really? Why not me?

00:24:06.166 --> 00:24:07.041
Hold on.

00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:09.958
Is this the right address?

00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:11.166
It is.

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:14.833
The door is open. Maybe they're inside.

00:24:14.916 --> 00:24:16.541
Be careful, honey.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.666
Excuse me.

00:24:21.625 --> 00:24:23.291
We're here to see the house.

00:24:24.666 --> 00:24:25.666
Honey.

00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:29.041
We need money to renovate this.

00:24:30.666 --> 00:24:31.791
Is that a bedroom?

00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:40.583
What was that?

00:24:40.666 --> 00:24:42.791
I think it's too creepy.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.250
I'm leaving.

00:24:51.166 --> 00:24:53.375
BIRD HOUSE FOR RENT
ABOVE KONDANG INTERNET CAFÉ

00:24:54.958 --> 00:24:56.250
KONDANG INTERNET CAFÉ
24 HOURS

00:25:12.916 --> 00:25:13.916
Excuse me.

00:25:17.791 --> 00:25:19.166
Can I help you?

00:25:19.666 --> 00:25:22.541
Is it true there's space for rent here?

00:25:23.416 --> 00:25:24.458
This one?

00:25:24.541 --> 00:25:26.458
Oh, the one upstairs?

00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:28.583
It's true. You wanna see?

00:25:28.666 --> 00:25:30.416
-Yes.
-Okay. I'll take you.

00:25:32.791 --> 00:25:33.833
I'm Tony.

00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:36.625
-Rozak. Follow me.
-Thank you.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.541
Wow. You have a ping-pong table?

00:25:44.291 --> 00:25:45.708
-Right.
-You play often?

00:25:45.791 --> 00:25:48.375
No. It belongs to Ali.

00:25:51.166 --> 00:25:52.458
He passed away.

00:25:52.541 --> 00:25:53.958
Rest in peace.

00:25:55.208 --> 00:25:57.791
The house upstairs was Ali's too.

00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:01.916
Are you a psychic? How did you know?

00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:06.208
This is it.

00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:14.625
Mom.

00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:17.750
You set aside money
for our college, right?

00:26:17.833 --> 00:26:19.750
Why not use that?

00:26:21.291 --> 00:26:23.416
Billy might not need it,

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:27.083
and I can try for a scholarship.

00:26:27.166 --> 00:26:30.416
We shouldn't use that carelessly.
Right, honey?

00:26:33.041 --> 00:26:34.291
Those savings…

00:26:36.541 --> 00:26:39.041
are to secure your future.

00:26:43.541 --> 00:26:45.416
You ate three.

00:26:45.916 --> 00:26:47.375
That was my share.

00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:51.666
But no worries,
I've had enough calories today.

00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:56.833
See? The owner's chill. Why are you upset?

00:27:02.916 --> 00:27:04.291
Everyone gets some.

00:27:10.166 --> 00:27:11.541
This is the house.

00:27:15.791 --> 00:27:16.791
This?

00:27:18.166 --> 00:27:19.083
Yes.

00:27:19.166 --> 00:27:21.083
Isn't this a bird house?

00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:23.875
Yeah, it is.

00:27:23.958 --> 00:27:26.083
You sure we're moving here?

00:27:26.666 --> 00:27:28.791
It's not about being sure.

00:27:30.791 --> 00:27:32.166
It's about sacrifice.

00:27:33.666 --> 00:27:34.916
Let's look inside.

00:27:49.791 --> 00:27:51.291
The birds still live here.

00:27:54.916 --> 00:27:56.291
Water's running.

00:27:59.166 --> 00:28:00.666
It's so dirty.

00:28:02.875 --> 00:28:03.708
Billy.

00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:06.041
Look at the view.

00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:07.583
Trains passing by.

00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:09.541
It's fine.

00:28:11.416 --> 00:28:13.250
As God Bless puts it,

00:28:13.833 --> 00:28:16.791
the roof may be straw and the floor dirt,

00:28:17.666 --> 00:28:19.166
but it's best to be here.

00:28:20.416 --> 00:28:24.750
Our own home

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.625
You see?

00:28:37.041 --> 00:28:39.541
You want to stay at the old house?

00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:42.791
It'll only cover us for two months.

00:28:43.416 --> 00:28:44.916
After that, we'd be homeless.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.166
Peace be upon you!

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.958
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you peace.

00:28:48.041 --> 00:28:49.958
Mr. Tony. This is Engkong.

00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:51.125
He's the landlord.

00:28:51.208 --> 00:28:52.500
Hello, Engkong.

00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:55.583
I didn't expect humans would live here.

00:28:55.666 --> 00:28:57.875
-I thought it's for--
-We'll take it, Engkong.

00:28:58.666 --> 00:28:59.916
This is for a year.

00:29:05.916 --> 00:29:07.666
-Gosh.
-Over there.

00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:09.916
Don't take it from me.

00:29:13.541 --> 00:29:17.000
The ceiling caved in just a moment ago.

00:29:17.083 --> 00:29:19.625
How about a discount for the repairs?

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.583
Here.

00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:27.791
Thank you.

00:29:27.875 --> 00:29:31.791
If I knew you were moving in right away,
I'd invite the head of the neighborhood

00:29:31.875 --> 00:29:36.083
to sort out the proof of address.

00:29:37.916 --> 00:29:40.541
Well, I hope you all like it here.

00:29:40.625 --> 00:29:41.458
Amen.

00:29:41.541 --> 00:29:43.583
Well, see you, Mr. Tony.

00:29:43.666 --> 00:29:45.833
-Thanks. Rozak.
-Thanks, Engkong.

00:29:45.916 --> 00:29:47.666
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you peace.

00:29:49.166 --> 00:29:50.041
Mom.

00:29:50.791 --> 00:29:53.416
I found a cheap pickup truck rental

00:29:53.916 --> 00:29:55.416
to help with the move.

00:29:56.041 --> 00:29:57.166
What do you think?

00:29:58.166 --> 00:29:59.791
No need for that, Sal.

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:03.041
What do you mean?

00:30:04.083 --> 00:30:05.291
Easy.

00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:06.208
NOT FOR SALE

00:30:06.291 --> 00:30:10.833
Everyone! We have
special deals before we move.

00:30:10.916 --> 00:30:12.625
-Come check it out!
-Hello!

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.958
Agus, I heard your wife
accidentally knocked over your TV?

00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:19.958
Good timing.
We're selling our TV for cheap.

00:30:20.041 --> 00:30:21.333
Here it is.

00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:24.708
-It's in good condition, Billy.
-Of course.

00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:26.958
-How much?
-Two million.

00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:29.208
-Can't you go lower?
-How much do you want?

00:30:29.291 --> 00:30:31.083
I have a million. How's that?

00:30:31.166 --> 00:30:33.125
-Okay, fine. Deal.
-Great.

00:30:33.208 --> 00:30:34.375
I sold the TV.

00:30:34.458 --> 00:30:35.708
MOVING OUT SALE
ALL DISCOUNT

00:30:35.791 --> 00:30:37.083
At half price.

00:30:37.166 --> 00:30:40.375
I'm good at sales.
You just don't believe me.

00:30:40.458 --> 00:30:44.208
Mom, this is from the sofa, dining table,
water dispenser, and washing machine.

00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:47.583
The total is Rp2,563,000.

00:30:47.666 --> 00:30:49.208
I've tried marking up the price--

00:30:49.291 --> 00:30:54.333
This is plenty.
Look. I'll take all of this.

00:30:54.416 --> 00:30:58.208
Good job, Billy.
But you have a lot to learn.

00:30:58.291 --> 00:30:59.583
Sally, give him some tips.

00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:04.625
I can't believe we've spent
15 years in this place.

00:31:05.791 --> 00:31:08.791
Soon someone else will live here,

00:31:09.916 --> 00:31:11.833
sleep in my room,

00:31:11.916 --> 00:31:13.666
renovate the kitchen,

00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:16.916
and erase all traces of us.

00:31:19.541 --> 00:31:21.791
All the money in the world

00:31:22.791 --> 00:31:25.416
can't buy our memories in this home.

00:31:28.416 --> 00:31:31.541
To others, this house might be cheap,

00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:36.416
but to me… it's priceless.

00:31:40.416 --> 00:31:41.666
Don't be sad.

00:31:43.416 --> 00:31:45.666
We'll come back to this house.

00:31:46.666 --> 00:31:47.708
Right?

00:31:47.791 --> 00:31:48.666
Amen.

00:31:49.791 --> 00:31:51.208
Are we really that broke?

00:31:52.041 --> 00:31:54.708
Even Mom pulled out
the money she invested.

00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:56.583
We've always been frugal,

00:31:56.666 --> 00:31:59.833
yet we're getting poorer
instead of richer.

00:31:59.916 --> 00:32:02.041
Money doesn't define wealth.

00:32:02.125 --> 00:32:04.750
It's about how you think.

00:32:13.708 --> 00:32:14.583
Dad!

00:32:16.916 --> 00:32:20.750
Please keep it steady. I'm trying to read.

00:32:20.833 --> 00:32:22.458
Okay.

00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:23.666
Sorry, Ken.

00:32:24.416 --> 00:32:27.250
My legs needs spooring and balancing.

00:32:41.458 --> 00:32:42.333
Billy!

00:32:42.416 --> 00:32:43.916
Help dad out.

00:32:47.666 --> 00:32:49.166
Watch out. Lower it.

00:33:03.041 --> 00:33:07.416
Once everything's moved and settled,

00:33:08.666 --> 00:33:09.791
we'll open this.

00:33:10.375 --> 00:33:15.375
Everyone should have one each,
not one piece for five people.

00:33:27.041 --> 00:33:29.541
It's a good thing
we have Billy's worn-out shirt.

00:34:02.041 --> 00:34:04.166
I can taste the cheese.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.375
Don't throw out the wrapper.

00:34:08.541 --> 00:34:09.666
There was a wrapper?

00:34:11.041 --> 00:34:12.791
Oh, my God, Billy!

00:34:15.083 --> 00:34:16.416
You ate it?

00:34:17.666 --> 00:34:19.041
Which one did you take?

00:34:20.791 --> 00:34:24.041
Take out ten million from the 18 million

00:34:24.666 --> 00:34:25.958
for emergency funds.

00:34:26.041 --> 00:34:28.416
As for the eight million,

00:34:29.291 --> 00:34:32.416
it's seed for our new savings.

00:34:34.166 --> 00:34:35.041
Honey.

00:34:35.916 --> 00:34:37.041
Is everything all right?

00:34:41.416 --> 00:34:42.791
I failed, Lin.

00:34:47.166 --> 00:34:50.083
I dragged you all
to live in a place like this.

00:34:55.666 --> 00:34:57.166
It feels like

00:34:58.791 --> 00:35:00.791
drifting in strong current…

00:35:04.041 --> 00:35:07.291
trying to swim to shore,
but never reaching it.

00:35:11.041 --> 00:35:11.875
It's tiring.

00:35:13.416 --> 00:35:14.541
Must be exhausting.

00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:21.291
You taught me and the kids

00:35:22.291 --> 00:35:25.416
to be frugal, to live on a budget,

00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:27.708
or whatever you want to call it.

00:35:28.291 --> 00:35:29.541
Do you realize?

00:35:30.166 --> 00:35:32.041
We've all gotten used to

00:35:33.166 --> 00:35:34.875
living with more than enough.

00:35:36.166 --> 00:35:39.083
Look at your friends.

00:35:39.166 --> 00:35:42.041
Do any of them take their families
on vacation every year?

00:35:42.791 --> 00:35:43.916
No, right?

00:35:44.541 --> 00:35:46.666
But that was back then.

00:35:47.333 --> 00:35:49.791
Look at how things are now.

00:35:50.416 --> 00:35:53.208
It's just an unfortunate situation.

00:35:53.291 --> 00:35:55.666
But it's my responsibility.

00:35:57.041 --> 00:36:01.250
If we stay consistent
and keep living frugally,

00:36:01.791 --> 00:36:05.416
I'm sure we won't be here for long.

00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:10.500
I'm just grateful we have a place to stay.

00:36:13.916 --> 00:36:17.291
When I think about it,
living here isn't too bad.

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:20.166
Climbing stairs all the time keeps us fit.

00:36:21.416 --> 00:36:22.416
And…

00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:26.916
it's peaceful up here.

00:36:28.666 --> 00:36:30.666
Not so much noise like downstairs.

00:36:32.916 --> 00:36:33.916
Right?

00:36:35.916 --> 00:36:39.083
Good morning, Jakarta!

00:36:54.875 --> 00:36:57.416
My chili's growing!

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.791
Please grow healthy.

00:37:05.416 --> 00:37:07.375
Okay, everything's ready.

00:37:09.166 --> 00:37:10.416
Here's yours.

00:37:13.166 --> 00:37:14.083
This is Sally's.

00:37:14.166 --> 00:37:17.166
I won't get smarter
if this is all I get to eat.

00:37:18.791 --> 00:37:21.916
The serving is small,
but full of nutrition.

00:37:22.416 --> 00:37:25.333
Please pay attention when I explain.

00:37:25.416 --> 00:37:29.333
It's got everything. Carbs, protein,
vitamins, and minerals.

00:37:29.416 --> 00:37:33.875
I say this every time.
Aren't you sick of hearing this by now?

00:37:34.791 --> 00:37:37.916
You want to be smarter?

00:37:38.791 --> 00:37:41.166
You need to study more, not eat more.

00:37:41.916 --> 00:37:44.958
-Okay? Now go.
-You gave Sally pocket money?

00:37:45.041 --> 00:37:46.500
As if.

00:37:47.916 --> 00:37:50.708
She earned it herself,
I didn't give her anything.

00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:52.791
-Just go.
-Playing favorites.

00:37:53.916 --> 00:37:56.166
Playing favorites?

00:37:59.791 --> 00:38:01.458
Mr. Tony.

00:38:01.541 --> 00:38:03.583
-Hey!
-Isn't it tiring to ride a bike?

00:38:03.666 --> 00:38:05.833
You'll get there faster
if you're on a motorcycle.

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:09.083
Besides, that bike is too modern for you.

00:38:09.166 --> 00:38:11.583
You should get an older model.

00:38:11.666 --> 00:38:12.666
See you later.

00:38:23.958 --> 00:38:25.291
It gets a bit tiring,

00:38:25.916 --> 00:38:28.541
but it's cheap and agile.

00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:31.166
I'm running late.

00:38:31.916 --> 00:38:32.916
I'm taking off.

00:38:33.666 --> 00:38:34.541
See you later.

00:38:42.541 --> 00:38:45.375
Mom! Please keep it down!

00:38:45.458 --> 00:38:48.500
I need to concentrate, thank you!

00:38:50.291 --> 00:38:51.125
Ken!

00:38:51.208 --> 00:38:54.583
I just asked you to draw grapes.

00:38:54.666 --> 00:38:56.666
What are you drawing now?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.916
Sorry.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.625
Mr. Tony.

00:39:12.708 --> 00:39:15.708
We're all going through salary cuts,
we know it's hard.

00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:20.291
But it makes us sadder
seeing you pretend to be excited.

00:39:23.166 --> 00:39:24.708
The situation may be hard,

00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:28.000
but we can still be optimistic, right?

00:39:33.666 --> 00:39:34.583
Okay.

00:39:34.666 --> 00:39:37.791
Given the limited water supply,

00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:41.333
and rising prices,

00:39:42.166 --> 00:39:45.791
I came up with an innovative solution.

00:39:46.416 --> 00:39:47.333
It's called…

00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:54.041
Poo-poo bottle.

00:39:56.666 --> 00:39:57.791
As a bidet?

00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:02.791
Everyone gets one liter of water a day

00:40:02.875 --> 00:40:04.875
for their personal bidet.

00:40:04.958 --> 00:40:07.708
Worried about foul play?

00:40:08.416 --> 00:40:11.208
That's not possible, as each bottle

00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:13.666
is secured with a lock.

00:40:14.541 --> 00:40:17.291
How's my presentation, Tony?

00:40:17.375 --> 00:40:18.250
Any questions?

00:40:20.916 --> 00:40:22.333
A bit extreme, but…

00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:25.583
I like it.

00:40:30.416 --> 00:40:31.958
Now it's your turn.

00:40:32.041 --> 00:40:33.958
-Okay, my turn.
-What's new at work?

00:40:38.416 --> 00:40:43.083
So, because Mr. Dirga
was impressed by my speech

00:40:43.166 --> 00:40:47.791
about being frugal during tough times…

00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:51.916
Tough times produce strong people,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.916
and strong people create a bright future.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.833
The question is, are we strong enough
to get through this difficult time?

00:41:00.916 --> 00:41:06.208
Our journey will be much harder
if we walk alone.

00:41:06.291 --> 00:41:11.125
But if we walk together,
hand in hand, living frugally together,

00:41:11.208 --> 00:41:14.083
not only can we overcome
these tough times,

00:41:14.166 --> 00:41:17.458
but we will also grow

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:23.458
in quality as human beings.

00:41:23.541 --> 00:41:26.666
This is the philosophy
I live by every day.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:27.708
Because…

00:41:32.541 --> 00:41:38.958
So I've been entrusted with coming up
with an efficiency program at work.

00:41:39.041 --> 00:41:40.708
So cool.

00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:44.083
If it's successful, I'll receive

00:41:44.166 --> 00:41:45.541
a bonus that's

00:41:47.208 --> 00:41:49.250
quite substantial.

00:41:53.041 --> 00:41:54.041
Substantial?

00:41:57.791 --> 00:42:00.541
So you still have your old job,

00:42:02.041 --> 00:42:05.291
and you're also taking on this new one?

00:42:06.041 --> 00:42:07.333
-Double job?
-Right.

00:42:07.416 --> 00:42:10.666
But… it's not double the salary?

00:42:12.041 --> 00:42:13.291
Just a bonus?

00:42:15.791 --> 00:42:17.291
Did you say yes?

00:42:18.916 --> 00:42:19.791
Yes.

00:42:21.541 --> 00:42:23.833
Your boss is so cunning.

00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:24.916
Wow.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.083
Ouch.

00:42:30.166 --> 00:42:31.916
What's the matter?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.166
Gosh.

00:42:33.791 --> 00:42:34.833
What's with him?

00:42:34.916 --> 00:42:38.541
That's because of
all the spicy snacks you're eating.

00:42:39.041 --> 00:42:40.291
Take a shower too.

00:42:48.041 --> 00:42:50.208
DAD - MOM - SALLY - BILLY - KENNY

00:42:52.541 --> 00:42:54.041
The water's out.

00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:57.666
Use the water in the bottle.

00:43:15.791 --> 00:43:17.291
I'm so dead.

00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:19.291
This is really happening.

00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:22.666
It's not enough.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:24.541
Use some of mine.

00:43:25.166 --> 00:43:26.625
Just pay me Rp3,000.

00:43:44.125 --> 00:43:45.125
Hey!

00:43:46.166 --> 00:43:47.708
-You a thief?
-No, sir.

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.916
-Admit it! You are!
-I'm not.

00:43:50.541 --> 00:43:52.541
-Sir!
-What are you doing here?

00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:56.208
I'm not a thief.
I'm looking for the homeowner.

00:43:56.291 --> 00:43:58.291
This house is empty!

00:43:59.833 --> 00:44:01.916
Sir, please wait.

00:44:02.666 --> 00:44:04.833
Let me breathe. Calm down.

00:44:06.791 --> 00:44:08.333
This is Mr. Tony's house, right?

00:44:09.166 --> 00:44:10.416
Tony Sukaharta?

00:44:11.166 --> 00:44:12.291
You know him?

00:44:13.166 --> 00:44:14.291
Who are you?

00:44:16.166 --> 00:44:17.541
I'm his relative.

00:44:19.291 --> 00:44:20.166
Who are you?

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:21.958
The security guard.

00:44:24.083 --> 00:44:25.541
Where's your energy?

00:44:26.291 --> 00:44:27.833
-We're pumped.
-We're pumped.

00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:30.458
Are you tired?

00:44:31.041 --> 00:44:33.875
I know being frugal can be tough.

00:44:34.791 --> 00:44:37.250
But when things get really tough,

00:44:37.333 --> 00:44:41.833
I just look at this.

00:44:41.916 --> 00:44:43.083
This is the key.

00:44:43.166 --> 00:44:45.000
My trick book.

00:44:45.083 --> 00:44:48.958
Do you know how powerful this book is?

00:44:50.416 --> 00:44:52.541
We can

00:44:53.541 --> 00:44:56.250
buy a TV.

00:44:57.583 --> 00:44:58.833
A TV?

00:44:58.916 --> 00:45:00.416
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.666
For real?
You're not messing with me, right?

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:05.291
The numbers don't lie. We can buy a TV.

00:45:05.375 --> 00:45:09.916
Is it wise to buy a device
that dumbs people down?

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:14.375
It clearly clashes
with our plan to be frugal--

00:45:16.666 --> 00:45:17.708
When are we buying it?

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.083
Want me to go buy it?

00:45:20.166 --> 00:45:21.166
Sure.

00:45:24.541 --> 00:45:26.125
Who's that?

00:45:30.916 --> 00:45:31.791
Cipto!

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.833
Sis!

00:45:33.916 --> 00:45:36.125
What happened to you?

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.291
What are you saying?

00:45:39.291 --> 00:45:41.291
How are you? Where have you been?

00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:46.041
UNCLE CIPTO, THE MOST FUN UNCLE
FRUGAL SCORE: 3%

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:49.791
How about it?

00:45:51.041 --> 00:45:52.041
It's a bit dusty.

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:54.166
Here, I'll wipe it.

00:45:57.416 --> 00:45:59.041
-No cracks?
-None.

00:46:01.166 --> 00:46:02.375
Discount?

00:46:02.458 --> 00:46:03.666
I don't think so.

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.041
There's a scratch. Still no discount?

00:46:06.125 --> 00:46:08.958
This is just a typical wear-and-tear mark.

00:46:09.041 --> 00:46:11.583
But I promise, the screen is scratch-free.

00:46:13.208 --> 00:46:14.208
Forty-two inches.

00:46:14.291 --> 00:46:15.291
Correct.

00:46:17.666 --> 00:46:18.833
The warranty's active?

00:46:18.916 --> 00:46:21.791
Just the store warranty applies.

00:46:23.916 --> 00:46:25.000
What's that sound?

00:46:25.666 --> 00:46:27.541
Well, you're shaking it.

00:46:28.416 --> 00:46:30.166
It's loose here.

00:46:31.416 --> 00:46:32.375
-It's loose.
-Really?

00:46:32.458 --> 00:46:34.583
Mind if I open it?
I want to check the connection.

00:46:34.666 --> 00:46:36.291
-You got a screwdriver?
-Okay, wait.

00:46:37.666 --> 00:46:40.041
The plus screwdriver.

00:46:40.125 --> 00:46:41.166
The plus.

00:46:42.666 --> 00:46:43.666
Thanks.

00:46:44.375 --> 00:46:45.333
This is the one.

00:46:54.125 --> 00:46:55.000
Mom.

00:46:56.041 --> 00:46:58.166
Shouldn't we keep the savings?

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:02.250
No, that's a reward for all of you.

00:47:02.916 --> 00:47:06.791
Don't worry. This won't affect
our savings plan.

00:47:06.875 --> 00:47:10.208
But listen up, everyone.

00:47:10.291 --> 00:47:12.208
Make sure you all still study hard,

00:47:12.291 --> 00:47:14.041
help us out around the house,

00:47:14.125 --> 00:47:17.041
-and stick to living--
-Frugally.

00:47:19.166 --> 00:47:20.833
Be frugal, Sal.

00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:26.625
Billy, what are you doing?

00:47:26.708 --> 00:47:28.125
Getting a drink for Uncle Cipto.

00:47:28.208 --> 00:47:30.041
Don't worry about me, Billy.

00:47:31.166 --> 00:47:32.875
I brought a tumbler.

00:47:32.958 --> 00:47:36.416
Here it is, Billy.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.000
This is no ordinary water.

00:47:39.083 --> 00:47:41.500
My partners are wealthy people.

00:47:41.583 --> 00:47:43.833
If you've ever been to
a fancy supermarket,

00:47:43.916 --> 00:47:47.583
they sell glass bottles
of pure water, no filtration.

00:47:47.666 --> 00:47:49.791
That's my partner, sis.

00:47:53.416 --> 00:47:56.333
Can I have some? It's fancy water, right?

00:47:56.416 --> 00:47:58.291
Very. Try it.

00:47:59.208 --> 00:48:01.625
Do you have a job now?

00:48:01.708 --> 00:48:04.583
Of course I do.
What kind of question is that?

00:48:04.708 --> 00:48:07.750
I'm working on a project right now.

00:48:07.833 --> 00:48:11.583
Not this fancy water,
it's a different one in retail.

00:48:13.416 --> 00:48:14.541
Where do you live?

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.000
Where do you live?

00:48:18.083 --> 00:48:19.958
I'm sharing an apartment with my friends.

00:48:20.041 --> 00:48:21.666
-Really?
-All good.

00:48:23.916 --> 00:48:25.708
You're sharing or freeloading?

00:48:25.791 --> 00:48:27.208
I'm sharing.

00:48:27.291 --> 00:48:29.916
Chill, I've got money, okay?

00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:32.708
And stop looking at me like that.

00:48:32.791 --> 00:48:34.541
Like what?

00:48:34.625 --> 00:48:36.666
Wait. Tony's calling.

00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:42.708
-Honey.
-I might be late coming home.

00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:44.083
Why?

00:48:44.166 --> 00:48:48.083
I was gonna have the TV delivered
so I could hitch a ride

00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:50.125
and save my legs from biking.

00:48:50.208 --> 00:48:52.041
But the delivery cost was crazy.

00:48:52.666 --> 00:48:54.583
And they charge extra if I tag along.

00:48:54.666 --> 00:48:56.208
Okay, I get it.

00:48:56.291 --> 00:48:57.166
Are you done?

00:48:58.583 --> 00:49:00.250
-It's done.
-All good?

00:49:00.333 --> 00:49:01.583
Yes.

00:49:01.666 --> 00:49:03.166
-Which side is up?
-This side.

00:49:03.833 --> 00:49:04.791
Hold on.

00:49:07.166 --> 00:49:08.125
Help me.

00:49:09.166 --> 00:49:10.208
There we are.

00:49:10.291 --> 00:49:11.916
I'll be home before it gets dark.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.833
All good to go. The remote, cables,
and the warranty booklet are inside.

00:49:15.916 --> 00:49:17.500
Drive safely.

00:49:17.583 --> 00:49:20.958
Take care and thank you.

00:49:23.333 --> 00:49:24.708
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:30.750
Are you having dinner here?

00:49:30.833 --> 00:49:32.875
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

00:49:32.958 --> 00:49:34.916
Sounds good. I actually

00:49:35.416 --> 00:49:38.833
just had lunch at a restaurant.
But you know how their portion

00:49:38.916 --> 00:49:40.458
doesn't really fill me up.

00:49:41.416 --> 00:49:43.833
Sure. But before dinner,

00:49:43.916 --> 00:49:46.916
go take your niece
and nephews out for a walk.

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.833
A walk?

00:49:48.916 --> 00:49:50.041
Go.

00:49:50.125 --> 00:49:51.583
Guys, let's go for a walk.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.041
I'm good, Uncle.

00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:55.458
This book…

00:49:56.041 --> 00:49:58.958
…has already taken me
to places far more interesting

00:49:59.041 --> 00:50:01.000
than anywhere around here.

00:50:01.083 --> 00:50:05.833
I assume you won't
take me anywhere far anyway.

00:50:06.666 --> 00:50:07.708
He…

00:50:07.791 --> 00:50:09.208
Is Kenny okay?

00:50:09.291 --> 00:50:10.458
Just let him be.

00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:12.083
-I think his head is--
-Just go.

00:50:12.166 --> 00:50:13.166
Let's take a walk.

00:50:14.125 --> 00:50:15.208
Take care.

00:50:23.125 --> 00:50:24.125
I want this.

00:50:24.208 --> 00:50:27.791
You don't wanna
look around first? Come on.

00:50:27.875 --> 00:50:29.125
Ice cream?

00:50:30.166 --> 00:50:32.083
I think it's going to rain, Sal.

00:50:32.666 --> 00:50:37.916
If you catch a cold after,
your mom will scold me.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.666
Let's get other snacks.
Plenty to choose from.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:41.833
Fine, then.

00:50:41.916 --> 00:50:43.416
How about this one?

00:50:44.416 --> 00:50:46.500
T-teok-bo-kki.

00:50:46.583 --> 00:50:47.583
Tteokbokki.

00:50:47.666 --> 00:50:49.625
-Yeah, that.
-Let's get this, Uncle.

00:50:49.708 --> 00:50:53.458
With a name like that,
it's probably not going to taste good.

00:50:53.541 --> 00:50:54.541
Let's go.

00:50:54.625 --> 00:50:56.208
You said I could choose,

00:50:56.291 --> 00:50:58.916
but I can't have this or that.

00:51:00.541 --> 00:51:02.666
It's not that you can't,

00:51:03.291 --> 00:51:07.791
but what if they don't taste good?
It'd be a waste of money.

00:51:08.666 --> 00:51:12.125
You sound just like Mom.
You've got more excuses than money.

00:51:13.041 --> 00:51:14.041
This sucks.

00:51:15.875 --> 00:51:17.208
KORSET
ROLLER SKATE COMMUNITY

00:51:17.291 --> 00:51:20.000
Wait here. I have a fun idea.

00:51:27.166 --> 00:51:28.541
I have a bad feeling.

00:51:29.166 --> 00:51:30.041
Yeah.

00:51:30.541 --> 00:51:32.916
I'm going home if he causes a scene.

00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:36.958
Guys! I got you a skateboard!

00:51:38.041 --> 00:51:39.916
You mean roller skates.

00:51:46.291 --> 00:51:49.125
You have to feed him after this.

00:51:49.208 --> 00:51:50.791
He must be starving.

00:51:53.625 --> 00:51:54.916
Thanks.

00:51:57.041 --> 00:51:57.916
Hang in there.

00:51:58.791 --> 00:52:02.791
Stay strong. We're all praying for you.

00:52:02.875 --> 00:52:04.500
-Cheer up, Billy!
-Cheer up!

00:52:04.583 --> 00:52:07.708
-Cheer up!
-Cheer up.

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:08.833
Cheer up.

00:52:10.916 --> 00:52:11.916
Seriously.

00:52:13.166 --> 00:52:15.541
Get me roller skates
for my birthday, Uncle.

00:52:16.375 --> 00:52:19.791
But how come everyone
was praying and rooting for me?

00:52:20.291 --> 00:52:21.541
What did you tell them?

00:52:22.166 --> 00:52:24.958
Can I borrow these for my nephew?

00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:28.333
He's battling cancer
and only has three months to live.

00:52:28.416 --> 00:52:34.416
He wants to try it once
before it's too late.

00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:38.916
Let's go home. Maybe the TV has arrived.

00:52:43.791 --> 00:52:45.666
How much blood did you give?

00:52:47.333 --> 00:52:48.375
It felt like a gallon.

00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:51.041
I should've asked for more porridge.

00:52:51.583 --> 00:52:52.708
So stingy.

00:52:54.291 --> 00:52:56.125
INDONESIAN RED CROSS
BLOOD DONATION UNIT

00:52:57.041 --> 00:52:59.041
-Honey.
-Surprise!

00:52:59.125 --> 00:53:02.875
You must be so tired.
You should've gone with Cipto.

00:53:02.958 --> 00:53:04.458
-Gosh.
-You okay, Dad?

00:53:04.541 --> 00:53:07.583
-Put it here.
-Yeah, let me through.

00:53:07.666 --> 00:53:09.750
-It's pretty heavy.
-Let me help.

00:53:09.833 --> 00:53:11.583
Where are Billy and Sally?

00:53:11.666 --> 00:53:14.708
They went out with Cipto.

00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:18.458
-Carefully.
-I got it. Kenny. Watch your foot.

00:53:19.541 --> 00:53:22.041
-We have a TV.
-Finally.

00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:24.958
Thank you, honey.

00:53:25.041 --> 00:53:26.208
Nice, isn't it?

00:53:26.291 --> 00:53:28.791
-Wait.
-Good thing it's home in one piece.

00:53:28.875 --> 00:53:30.416
You okay?

00:53:30.916 --> 00:53:32.708
-Oh, gosh.
-I'm okay.

00:53:32.791 --> 00:53:34.541
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you peace.

00:53:35.291 --> 00:53:37.291
-Dad!
-Our TV, Billy.

00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:42.041
-Hey.
-Cipto.

00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:44.583
Your skin is lighter.

00:53:44.666 --> 00:53:45.875
On skincare?

00:53:47.916 --> 00:53:50.041
You've gotten ragged.

00:53:50.125 --> 00:53:50.958
Seriously?

00:53:51.041 --> 00:53:52.166
Why are you trembling?

00:53:52.666 --> 00:53:54.416
-It's a long story.
-Same here.

00:53:55.041 --> 00:53:56.541
-New TV?
-Yeah.

00:53:58.166 --> 00:53:59.083
In God's name.

00:54:01.541 --> 00:54:02.833
Don't try to be cool.

00:54:02.916 --> 00:54:03.958
Push the button.

00:54:04.041 --> 00:54:06.541
"For your eye health,

00:54:06.625 --> 00:54:08.750
this TV includes a proximity sensor."

00:54:09.416 --> 00:54:15.916
"It only turns on when you're at
the recommended viewing distance."

00:54:19.041 --> 00:54:21.583
-Move back, everyone.
-You should read it first.

00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:23.541
Thanks, Ken.

00:54:24.791 --> 00:54:25.625
Try now.

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:29.625
Ken, it still won't turn on.

00:54:30.291 --> 00:54:32.000
How far should we be?

00:54:32.083 --> 00:54:35.083
Five times the TV's diagonal length.

00:54:35.916 --> 00:54:37.875
Stop, stop.

00:54:37.958 --> 00:54:38.791
Ready?

00:54:40.958 --> 00:54:41.791
Are you serious?

00:54:41.875 --> 00:54:44.833
Did you bring the wrong one?

00:54:44.916 --> 00:54:48.500
No, I tried this one and it worked.

00:54:48.583 --> 00:54:50.083
We'll take care of it.

00:54:50.166 --> 00:54:53.666
It usually works when women do it.

00:54:54.166 --> 00:54:55.208
Five,

00:54:55.916 --> 00:54:56.791
six,

00:54:58.666 --> 00:54:59.541
seven.

00:55:00.041 --> 00:55:01.500
It has to work now.

00:55:13.041 --> 00:55:16.291
All that cycling with the TV was worth it!

00:55:17.291 --> 00:55:18.791
Finally!

00:55:20.791 --> 00:55:22.166
Where are you going after this?

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:25.958
I think I want to go see Mom.
It's been a while.

00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:29.125
You never visit her. You don't love her?

00:55:29.208 --> 00:55:31.083
Of course I love her.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.541
Can you afford the transport?

00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:37.916
I'm okay, sis.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
But if you'd like to offer some…

00:55:40.583 --> 00:55:41.583
Well,

00:55:42.666 --> 00:55:45.666
I can only offer a bit.

00:55:46.666 --> 00:55:48.791
Thanks for treating my kids.

00:55:51.625 --> 00:55:53.458
Send my regards to mom.

00:55:55.041 --> 00:55:58.666
I haven't been able to visit her,
it's tough times.

00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:02.000
Mom loves you, you know.

00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:05.291
Try not to fight with her.

00:56:05.916 --> 00:56:09.666
Listen to what she says. She means well.

00:56:10.541 --> 00:56:11.916
Get yourself a job.

00:56:13.291 --> 00:56:16.666
You're young, don't waste time.

00:56:25.666 --> 00:56:27.041
Fifteen thousand?

00:56:28.041 --> 00:56:29.250
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:37.583
AGOES MEATBALL SOUP

00:56:41.375 --> 00:56:42.250
Delicious.

00:56:42.333 --> 00:56:43.375
Kids.

00:56:43.916 --> 00:56:46.541
I forgot I can't have beef.

00:56:47.041 --> 00:56:52.000
Do you want to buy a meatball
for Rp3,000 each?

00:56:52.083 --> 00:56:54.208
After all, you can't buy
just a piece here.

00:56:54.291 --> 00:56:56.583
-Sure.
-I'll take two.

00:56:56.666 --> 00:56:58.083
Please do.

00:56:58.708 --> 00:56:59.541
Go ahead.

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:02.250
-Take some.
-This is a good deal.

00:57:03.625 --> 00:57:04.791
Can I buy the noodles too?

00:57:04.875 --> 00:57:08.750
-Go ahead. Rp3,000 as well.
-Really? Okay.

00:57:08.833 --> 00:57:10.041
I'm taking two.

00:57:13.791 --> 00:57:14.750
Not bad.

00:57:15.916 --> 00:57:17.416
-Thanks, Gramps.
-You're welcome.

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.333
-Sir, that makes it Rp18,000?
-Right.

00:57:20.416 --> 00:57:22.458
Here. You can keep the change.

00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:25.208
Gosh. Thank you.

00:57:25.291 --> 00:57:26.416
You're welcome.

00:57:28.791 --> 00:57:30.416
Rp5,000 profit.

00:57:31.916 --> 00:57:33.916
The broth is filling enough.

00:57:38.375 --> 00:57:41.583
GRANDPA HANZ, THE PROFESSOR OF FRUGALITY
FRUGAL SCORE: 101%

00:57:46.916 --> 00:57:50.791
-Hello. Peace be upon you, Ton.
-And upon you peace, Dad.

00:57:51.416 --> 00:57:53.291
I'm in Cirebon now.

00:57:53.916 --> 00:57:55.916
Just got access to free Wi-Fi.

00:57:57.041 --> 00:57:59.833
I left Semarang at dawn.

00:57:59.916 --> 00:58:02.041
Why so sudden? Where are you going?

00:58:02.125 --> 00:58:06.500
I'm going to your place
for my birthday this year.

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:12.416
It's cheaper if just one person went.

00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.958
But make sure to pick me up, okay?

00:58:15.041 --> 00:58:17.041
Yes, Dad. Of course.

00:58:17.125 --> 00:58:18.500
Peace be upon you.

00:58:18.583 --> 00:58:20.541
And upon you peace.

00:58:24.166 --> 00:58:25.250
Wow.

00:58:25.333 --> 00:58:28.000
Here's yours.

00:58:29.666 --> 00:58:31.125
You should try this.

00:58:31.208 --> 00:58:32.958
MARKET SHOPPING SERVICE
CHEAPER! HASSLE-FREE!

00:58:33.041 --> 00:58:33.916
I made it myself.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.791
-A tester?
-I'm hoping to sell this if it's good.

00:58:36.875 --> 00:58:38.166
-Thanks.
-See you.

00:58:39.208 --> 00:58:40.958
-Mrs. Rosi.
-Yes.

00:58:41.041 --> 00:58:44.208
I asked for extra oranges.

00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:46.083
The seller tried to trick me,

00:58:46.791 --> 00:58:48.708
luckily I had a scale with me.

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:50.208
So I asked for extra.

00:58:50.291 --> 00:58:54.041
Thanks, Mrs. Linda. Not just the shopping,
but for the extra stuff too.

00:58:54.125 --> 00:58:55.750
-Pleasure's mine.
-Thank you.

00:58:55.833 --> 00:58:58.083
-Order again soon.
-Will do. See you.

00:58:58.166 --> 00:58:59.625
Okay. See you.

00:59:03.458 --> 00:59:04.333
Hey!

00:59:05.291 --> 00:59:09.208
The Wi-Fi works when the door's open!

00:59:09.291 --> 00:59:10.666
Oh, please, Mrs. Linda.

00:59:11.666 --> 00:59:13.208
Raking in cash, ma'am?

00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:15.958
Zak, won't you extend the Wi-Fi range?

00:59:16.041 --> 00:59:17.250
-What?
-One meatball soup.

00:59:17.333 --> 00:59:18.583
This is so last minute!

00:59:18.666 --> 00:59:20.083
-Kenny!
-What?

00:59:20.166 --> 00:59:21.750
Grandpa Hanz is coming!

00:59:21.833 --> 00:59:22.958
I knew it.

00:59:23.041 --> 00:59:24.583
I was wondering,

00:59:24.666 --> 00:59:28.375
we haven't talked about
going to Semarang for his birthday.

00:59:29.833 --> 00:59:33.916
But I figured it's because
our current situation.

00:59:36.041 --> 00:59:38.083
Okay, I'm ready.

00:59:39.166 --> 00:59:40.625
Are you okay going alone?

00:59:53.416 --> 00:59:55.833
There's some bok choy, but it's small.

00:59:55.916 --> 00:59:57.291
Gosh.

01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:03.458
Peace be upon you.

01:00:03.541 --> 01:00:05.041
And upon you peace.

01:00:05.666 --> 01:00:07.208
What is he carrying?

01:00:08.666 --> 01:00:10.458
We should've gone shopping too.

01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:13.041
Why did he wait until the last minute?

01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:15.083
What should we cook?

01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:16.625
Cabbage and salt.

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:18.208
What?

01:00:18.291 --> 01:00:22.083
Grandpa used to say
just having those two is enough.

01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:25.833
But we don't even have cabbage.

01:00:25.916 --> 01:00:27.375
What are you doing, Ken?

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:29.125
It's Grandpa's birthday present.

01:00:29.208 --> 01:00:32.083
Gosh, I forgot to buy a present.

01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:33.916
I haven't made anything.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.875
I can tell him this is from all of us.

01:00:37.958 --> 01:00:39.708
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:41.208
Great, I'll help you.

01:00:41.291 --> 01:00:42.625
What are we making?

01:00:42.708 --> 01:00:46.833
It's okay. It's faster if I do it myself.

01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:50.041
Veggies!

01:00:50.666 --> 01:00:52.250
-Veggie cart!
-Right!

01:00:53.791 --> 01:00:54.916
Mister!

01:00:55.541 --> 01:00:56.666
Wait!

01:00:58.208 --> 01:01:00.208
VEGGIE GUY VS LINDA

01:01:02.583 --> 01:01:06.791
Chinese cabbage, Rp14,000 a kilogram.

01:01:07.666 --> 01:01:08.541
Seven.

01:01:08.625 --> 01:01:10.375
Rp14,000.

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:12.375
That's for two kilograms.

01:01:12.958 --> 01:01:14.541
Fourteen for a kilogram.

01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:17.666
Rp14,000 for two kilograms.

01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:21.000
Two kilograms is Rp26,000.

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:25.666
That much would get me
three kilograms online.

01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:29.708
Go buy online, then. It's different.

01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:31.916
Online sellers don't push carts.

01:01:32.416 --> 01:01:33.291
Fine!

01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:35.958
How much bean sprouts would you like?

01:01:36.041 --> 01:01:38.416
Ma'am! How much are bean sprouts online?

01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:41.291
Hey.

01:01:42.541 --> 01:01:44.750
-Finished printing? Let me see.
-Yes.

01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:46.875
It's all good.

01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:52.875
Print double-sided next time.

01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:57.958
Remember, save paper, save nature…

01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:59.041
Save the budget.

01:01:59.125 --> 01:02:00.166
Exactly.

01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:03.083
Please remove the water dispenser

01:02:03.166 --> 01:02:05.333
-and bring a five-gallon jar.
-Yes, sir.

01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:09.375
-Over here.
-Okay.

01:02:11.541 --> 01:02:12.583
Sir.

01:02:15.416 --> 01:02:16.916
Filling up your tumbler?

01:02:22.416 --> 01:02:25.333
Open the lid first.
You've never used this before?

01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:27.541
You spilled some.

01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:36.916
Thirteen.

01:02:41.541 --> 01:02:43.375
Why didn't Grandpa take the train?

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:46.416
It's faster and more comfortable.

01:02:47.416 --> 01:02:50.208
At his age, he must be exhausted.

01:02:50.291 --> 01:02:52.375
You know how he is.

01:02:52.458 --> 01:02:54.833
If there were a horse-drawn carriage
from Semarang to Jakarta,

01:02:54.916 --> 01:02:56.416
he'd definitely take it.

01:02:57.291 --> 01:02:58.291
Just like Dad.

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:00.833
Frugality runs in the family.

01:03:02.166 --> 01:03:05.166
If so, why are you wasteful?

01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:07.875
Don't tell me…

01:03:09.166 --> 01:03:11.125
There's no way I'm adopted.

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:13.916
You've seen Dad's childhood photos, right?

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:16.625
I look just like him,

01:03:17.666 --> 01:03:18.750
unfortunately.

01:03:25.541 --> 01:03:29.458
Honey, two kilograms
of Chinese cabbage go for Rp10,000.

01:03:29.541 --> 01:03:32.416
Guess how much the delivery is? Rp20,000.

01:03:32.916 --> 01:03:36.333
That's way too expensive.
Where's the shop?

01:03:36.416 --> 01:03:37.333
Kalideres.

01:03:37.416 --> 01:03:40.416
Okay, share the location. I'll pick it up.

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:07.916
Grandpa!

01:04:09.125 --> 01:04:10.916
Sally, Billy!

01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:14.041
It'd be a waste.

01:04:14.666 --> 01:04:15.875
They're unopened.

01:04:29.791 --> 01:04:31.541
CABBAGE FARMER
KALIDERES

01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:43.416
Thank you.

01:04:51.916 --> 01:04:55.083
-Honey. Cabbage.
-My Chinese cabbage!

01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:56.458
Thanks, honey.

01:04:56.541 --> 01:04:59.375
Take off your shoes and close the door.

01:04:59.458 --> 01:05:00.416
Right.

01:05:04.458 --> 01:05:07.166
I knew it.

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.583
Hey, hey…

01:05:14.666 --> 01:05:16.916
Seriously, 1.8?

01:05:17.416 --> 01:05:19.375
Honey, you didn't weigh it again?

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:21.208
We paid for two kilograms.

01:05:21.291 --> 01:05:23.416
You can take 200 grams

01:05:24.166 --> 01:05:26.916
from my portion.

01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:30.166
That's not it. The seller scammed us.

01:05:30.916 --> 01:05:31.833
Whatever.

01:05:31.916 --> 01:05:33.833
-Peace be upon you.
-Look who's here.

01:05:33.916 --> 01:05:36.000
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you peace.

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:37.833
-Dad!
-And upon you peace.

01:05:37.916 --> 01:05:40.958
You're finally here. Come on in.

01:05:41.041 --> 01:05:42.208
Yes, yes.

01:05:42.291 --> 01:05:43.166
Dad.

01:05:43.875 --> 01:05:44.958
-I'm tired.
-Tony!

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:48.625
What happened? You're sweating buckets.

01:05:48.708 --> 01:05:49.958
I was working.

01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:52.458
What do you do for work now?

01:05:53.041 --> 01:05:54.291
Working hard.

01:05:56.416 --> 01:05:57.625
Kenny.

01:05:57.708 --> 01:05:58.958
Grandpa's here!

01:05:59.041 --> 01:06:00.916
-Grandpa!
-Hi!

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:03.458
My grandson.

01:06:03.541 --> 01:06:05.708
Good boy. How are you?

01:06:06.541 --> 01:06:07.958
Did you miss me?

01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:09.958
Before you came, I did.

01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:12.416
Now I don't because you're here!

01:06:13.166 --> 01:06:14.041
I guess so.

01:06:16.166 --> 01:06:18.541
We all missed you.

01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:22.583
Come on, help out so Grandpa can rest.

01:06:22.666 --> 01:06:24.125
Take it easy, Dad.

01:06:28.041 --> 01:06:30.166
Good thing Kenny reminded us

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:32.250
Grandpa likes cabbage.

01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:34.125
You like it, Dad?

01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:36.916
This is my favorite dish.

01:06:38.791 --> 01:06:39.833
Tony.

01:06:39.916 --> 01:06:43.666
I think you made the right decision.

01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:46.541
A house doesn't need to be huge,

01:06:46.625 --> 01:06:49.500
as long as it's comfortable. Right?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.916
But we shouldn't let go of our dreams.

01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:57.166
It's what keeps us motivated.

01:06:57.250 --> 01:07:00.416
Believe that our efforts

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:04.833
will always pay off.

01:07:11.541 --> 01:07:12.833
That's true.

01:07:12.916 --> 01:07:13.750
What does that mean?

01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:14.833
Right.

01:07:16.541 --> 01:07:19.625
God willing,

01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:24.208
by next year we'll have saved enough

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.541
to rent our old place.

01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:29.791
That's it.

01:07:31.041 --> 01:07:33.750
Stay motivated and have faith.

01:07:35.666 --> 01:07:39.291
A house isn't just walls and a roof,

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:44.458
it's the memories it holds.

01:07:44.541 --> 01:07:51.500
Happy birthday to you

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.375
Blow the candles.

01:07:55.666 --> 01:07:56.833
They're at it again.

01:07:58.166 --> 01:08:02.708
The anti-corruption commission
is currently…

01:08:02.791 --> 01:08:04.625
THIS PROPERTY HAS BEEN SEIZED

01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:07.958
-Sir, look this way!
-Sir!

01:08:08.041 --> 01:08:11.416
Mister. Would you mind
photographing my family?

01:08:13.416 --> 01:08:15.416
I don't have a family photo.

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:18.041
Our house is over there.

01:08:19.958 --> 01:08:22.166
Over here, cameras ready!

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:23.083
Sure.

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:24.375
Ready?

01:08:26.333 --> 01:08:27.958
Ready? One, two--

01:08:28.041 --> 01:08:29.416
Billy, smile!

01:08:32.291 --> 01:08:37.541
Wishing you long life

01:08:37.625 --> 01:08:44.583
May you live long and be blessed

01:08:44.666 --> 01:08:49.083
Live long and be blessed

01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:51.583
Thank God.

01:08:51.666 --> 01:08:54.125
In the name of God,
the most Gracious, Merciful.

01:08:57.791 --> 01:09:00.125
Now, let's dig in!

01:09:03.458 --> 01:09:05.333
-Yummy.
-Stay healthy, Dad.

01:09:05.416 --> 01:09:06.291
Who made these?

01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:08.666
It was a gift.

01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:11.208
Sorry it's not much.

01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:12.875
Let's just be grateful.

01:09:12.958 --> 01:09:15.416
Attention, everyone.

01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:22.625
This story is titled
The Ants of Sukaharta.

01:09:23.666 --> 01:09:29.708
Inspired by Aesop's
The Ant and the Grasshopper.

01:09:38.833 --> 01:09:40.708
It looks great.

01:09:40.791 --> 01:09:44.708
The Sukaharta ants worked hard all summer,

01:09:45.416 --> 01:09:48.333
while a grasshopper named Billy

01:09:48.916 --> 01:09:53.000
spent his days running,
singing, and laughing without care.

01:09:53.083 --> 01:09:55.166
That's Billy.

01:09:58.083 --> 01:10:02.458
"Why bother working so hard?
You should enjoy life."

01:10:02.541 --> 01:10:04.291
And when winter arrived,

01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:07.916
sure enough,
Billy the grasshopper went hungry

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:11.708
because he had no food.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:12.875
But guess what?

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:14.625
The ants didn't get mad.

01:10:14.708 --> 01:10:16.958
Instead, they shared what they had,

01:10:17.041 --> 01:10:19.458
not because they had plenty of food,

01:10:19.541 --> 01:10:22.666
but because they knew that happiness

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:24.708
is not about how much we have,

01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:31.458
but about how much we can give
and support each other during the storm.

01:10:32.375 --> 01:10:33.583
Thank you.

01:10:33.666 --> 01:10:36.208
And happy birthday, Grandpa Hanz.

01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:37.166
That was great!

01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:45.500
Your grandson is amazing, right?

01:10:45.583 --> 01:10:48.791
When did you make that?

01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:55.916
To tell you the truth,

01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:59.666
there's someone interested
in renting the house.

01:11:01.416 --> 01:11:03.916
But I'm holding it off for you.

01:11:05.666 --> 01:11:10.125
But you need to pay
for the full year in two weeks.

01:11:12.541 --> 01:11:14.416
I'll make sure you'll have the money

01:11:15.416 --> 01:11:17.250
by the 1st of next month.

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:19.166
Thanks, Maya.

01:11:22.541 --> 01:11:25.000
See? That's dangerous.

01:11:25.083 --> 01:11:30.291
No matter how much we fix it,
this house just won't hold up.

01:11:32.666 --> 01:11:34.208
Peace be upon you!

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:36.541
-And upon you peace.
-And upon you peace.

01:11:37.666 --> 01:11:42.333
Hi, guys. I brought Engkong here

01:11:42.416 --> 01:11:44.750
to talk about the lease extension.

01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:48.333
I don't even know what to say.

01:11:48.416 --> 01:11:51.916
You can see the condition of the house.

01:11:52.791 --> 01:11:54.625
We fixed it up multiple times.

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:57.916
But it keeps needing repair.

01:11:58.791 --> 01:12:01.291
This will only benefit you.

01:12:03.666 --> 01:12:06.791
The heck? You're the ones living here.

01:12:07.416 --> 01:12:08.916
I'm not looking for profit.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.541
It's fine if you don't want to
renew the lease.

01:12:12.625 --> 01:12:14.291
Yeah, we're planning to move out.

01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:15.375
Uh-oh.

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:20.708
Then let me know
once you've emptied it out.

01:12:20.791 --> 01:12:24.333
I'll pass the lease to Haji Jaul
for his goat house…

01:12:24.416 --> 01:12:25.666
I mean, bird house.

01:12:26.541 --> 01:12:27.666
What is wrong with them?

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:29.208
Goodbye! Peace be upon you!

01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:31.958
-And upon you peace.
-And upon you peace.

01:12:34.291 --> 01:12:35.583
Well, then…

01:12:36.916 --> 01:12:38.166
We're moving out?

01:12:38.916 --> 01:12:40.250
Do we have enough?

01:12:40.333 --> 01:12:43.958
Your bonus should cover the difference.

01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:48.291
I can chip in the rest
from my shopping service.

01:12:52.708 --> 01:12:54.791
Love in hardship.

01:12:56.791 --> 01:13:00.291
That's Grandpa's camera.
He sent it to get fixed,

01:13:00.916 --> 01:13:03.458
but Kenny loves using it.

01:13:03.541 --> 01:13:05.541
He's had a change of dreams.

01:13:05.625 --> 01:13:07.916
He wants to become a photojournalist.

01:13:08.416 --> 01:13:10.666
Let's see if he changes
his mind in a week.

01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:15.166
So, I'm introducing an innovation,

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:17.333
glow-in-the-dark T-shirts.

01:13:17.416 --> 01:13:21.333
Veterans and die-hard fans will receive

01:13:21.416 --> 01:13:24.208
a headband, socks, and a scarf.

01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:25.666
FAN PACKAGE - 200,000 RUPIAH

01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:27.666
That's all from my presentation.

01:13:28.166 --> 01:13:29.333
Thank you.

01:13:31.166 --> 01:13:32.875
Totally amazing.

01:13:34.541 --> 01:13:37.541
Acting like a real estate agent
for a T-shirt.

01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:40.000
So extra.

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:43.583
It's called dedication.

01:13:43.666 --> 01:13:45.333
Gosh!

01:13:45.416 --> 01:13:47.708
-What do you think?
-I love it.

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:49.833
-Should we order now?
-Yeah.

01:13:49.916 --> 01:13:51.708
Okay. Fifty pieces…

01:13:51.791 --> 01:13:52.791
In two weeks.

01:13:53.416 --> 01:13:54.541
Here's the contract, Sal.

01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:56.041
Sign here.

01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:01.333
PURCHASE AGREEMENT

01:14:01.416 --> 01:14:02.958
-The down payment of 50%.
-Got it.

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:09.750
Sir, about my bonus
you promised back then,

01:14:09.833 --> 01:14:11.625
when will I receive it?

01:14:12.291 --> 01:14:14.916
Don't worry about it.

01:14:16.041 --> 01:14:18.083
The bonus is definitely coming.

01:14:19.666 --> 01:14:20.916
Thank you, sir.

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:26.541
However, I'll give you half of it first.

01:14:27.166 --> 01:14:29.041
But I need cash right now.

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:32.833
I need it in full.

01:14:33.416 --> 01:14:34.791
Is that so?

01:14:35.666 --> 01:14:36.958
Yes. Can you do it?

01:14:37.041 --> 01:14:39.916
Sure, why not.

01:14:40.791 --> 01:14:43.666
But given the current situation…

01:14:46.416 --> 01:14:50.875
I don't think I can keep you anymore.

01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:56.875
What?

01:14:57.791 --> 01:14:59.291
You only get half?

01:15:00.416 --> 01:15:03.333
What now? We're moving in two weeks!

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:04.875
Didn't you think about that?

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:08.916
Lin, please talk to Maya again.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.958
I've already given her a hard time.

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:14.000
But Maya's got targets to meet, you know?

01:15:15.416 --> 01:15:18.416
We're lucky she bought us two weeks.

01:15:30.041 --> 01:15:32.541
Mrs. Linda.
You haven't gone to the market?

01:15:33.416 --> 01:15:35.625
It's so quiet, like a failed project.

01:15:37.458 --> 01:15:39.750
I'll have the usual.

01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:42.291
Mrs. Surti!

01:15:43.708 --> 01:15:45.125
You've gone shopping.

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:46.916
You didn't ask me.

01:15:47.666 --> 01:15:51.583
Sorry, Linda.
This online service is fresher,

01:15:51.666 --> 01:15:53.583
it's directly from the supplier.

01:15:53.666 --> 01:15:55.291
The others are ordering there too.

01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:02.166
Excuse me, I'm in a rush to cook.

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:03.708
Okay.

01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:11.916
@TITIP_DONG
PRACTICAL AND EASY

01:16:15.541 --> 01:16:18.583
At this point, you might as well resign.

01:16:18.666 --> 01:16:23.041
You've been there for years
and they still don't appreciate you?

01:16:28.166 --> 01:16:29.666
To be honest,

01:16:31.291 --> 01:16:32.750
I'm at a loss, Bram.

01:16:33.666 --> 01:16:37.250
Should I accept the cut or resign?

01:16:37.333 --> 01:16:38.708
You should leave.

01:16:38.791 --> 01:16:40.166
The company is going under.

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:42.000
People are getting laid off,

01:16:42.083 --> 01:16:44.041
they're selling everything
in the warehouse,

01:16:44.125 --> 01:16:47.208
even the meeting room AC
was replaced with a cheap fan.

01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:50.458
Why are you so afraid to resign?

01:16:50.541 --> 01:16:53.708
Look at me, ever since I quit,
I've been so much happier at work.

01:16:53.791 --> 01:16:57.625
Life's not stressful,
and my face is glowing.

01:16:57.708 --> 01:16:59.541
Are you going to keep rotting like this?

01:17:02.541 --> 01:17:04.625
For Jessica?

01:17:04.708 --> 01:17:05.791
That's me.

01:17:06.958 --> 01:17:10.708
Mr. Tony, if you decide to resign,

01:17:10.791 --> 01:17:12.958
you should let me know.

01:17:13.541 --> 01:17:16.083
I have another motorcycle at home,

01:17:16.166 --> 01:17:19.916
you can borrow it to use as a bike-taxi
while looking for a new job.

01:17:20.416 --> 01:17:22.041
Okay? See you later.

01:17:22.666 --> 01:17:23.791
Ride safe.

01:17:28.166 --> 01:17:29.833
-That's mine.
-Here you go, sir.

01:17:29.916 --> 01:17:31.166
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

01:17:35.291 --> 01:17:37.666
Look, you can try other stores.

01:17:38.791 --> 01:17:40.750
They won't offer a price that low.

01:17:41.416 --> 01:17:45.041
I know. I've been to 20 other shops.

01:17:47.416 --> 01:17:49.375
Fine, make it five days.

01:17:49.458 --> 01:17:51.708
AGUNG PRINTING
WE PRINT EVERYTHING

01:17:51.791 --> 01:17:54.666
Sure, but pay me upfront.

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:55.875
Huh?

01:17:55.958 --> 01:17:59.250
What? It's usually half price.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.583
We've just started the business,

01:18:02.666 --> 01:18:04.333
the store is brand-new.

01:18:04.416 --> 01:18:06.625
So we're low on production funds.

01:18:07.208 --> 01:18:09.166
That's why we're offering
such a low price.

01:18:09.916 --> 01:18:10.916
Opening promo.

01:18:11.541 --> 01:18:14.583
All right, I'll bring the money tomorrow.

01:18:14.666 --> 01:18:17.416
But I want daily progress updates.

01:18:18.166 --> 01:18:19.916
-Got it?
-Sure thing. We got it.

01:18:20.541 --> 01:18:23.916
Also, use this material for my order.

01:18:27.041 --> 01:18:28.916
That should cut the price in half, right?

01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:43.166
What do you mean, Maya?

01:18:43.916 --> 01:18:47.708
Linda, my boss told me to.

01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:49.333
I don't have any say.

01:18:49.416 --> 01:18:51.416
I can't cover for anyone.

01:18:53.291 --> 01:18:56.416
What about your promise by next week?

01:18:57.791 --> 01:19:01.000
Are you interested in renting this house?

01:19:01.083 --> 01:19:05.166
Yeah, that was the plan.

01:19:06.791 --> 01:19:10.291
But it seems like
a lot of work to renovate.

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:17.416
Listen, Lin. Just get the money ready.

01:19:18.291 --> 01:19:21.541
I'll try to find him another place.

01:19:22.041 --> 01:19:24.000
Hopefully he'll like that one better.

01:19:24.666 --> 01:19:26.666
I've lived here for 15 years.

01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:30.583
My children were all born here.

01:19:32.166 --> 01:19:36.541
The neighborhood is nice,
and there's a top school nearby.

01:19:37.083 --> 01:19:38.000
Right…

01:19:39.416 --> 01:19:41.541
The neighbors are caring.

01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:46.666
This house means a lot to my family.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.333
I see…

01:19:52.416 --> 01:19:54.291
So if you have any doubts

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:59.916
and believe there's still a lot
to repair in this house,

01:20:01.916 --> 01:20:04.458
my advice would be not to take it.

01:20:07.791 --> 01:20:11.250
Because I'll return to this house.

01:20:12.625 --> 01:20:13.541
Excuse us.

01:20:13.625 --> 01:20:18.791
FOR RENT

01:20:30.166 --> 01:20:31.833
At the moment,

01:20:31.916 --> 01:20:34.750
we've used half of the grocery money

01:20:35.416 --> 01:20:39.541
for Grandpa Hanz's travel costs.

01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:44.041
Until Dad's salary arrives,

01:20:45.291 --> 01:20:50.458
we'll make do with the remaining funds.

01:21:13.416 --> 01:21:14.250
Honey.

01:21:14.875 --> 01:21:19.041
I think we're out of time. Five days left.

01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:21.166
Should I take on a side job?

01:21:21.791 --> 01:21:22.791
Is that okay?

01:21:23.666 --> 01:21:27.375
It's useless. We won't make it in time.

01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:36.125
Actually, I have an idea that might work.

01:21:36.208 --> 01:21:37.333
But…

01:21:38.666 --> 01:21:41.791
I'm not sure about it.

01:21:47.541 --> 01:21:48.916
Peace be upon you.

01:21:50.041 --> 01:21:51.916
-And upon you peace.
-And upon you peace.

01:21:55.958 --> 01:21:57.041
Sal.

01:22:06.458 --> 01:22:11.208
Our moving plans
might have to be called off.

01:22:13.333 --> 01:22:15.625
Dad only got half of his bonus,

01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:19.291
so we plan to

01:22:20.791 --> 01:22:23.833
borrow your savings. Is that okay?

01:22:28.291 --> 01:22:31.666
I'm sorry, Mom.
This is all I have right now.

01:22:32.375 --> 01:22:34.291
What is this?

01:22:41.166 --> 01:22:44.041
FOR RENT

01:22:49.541 --> 01:22:51.958
-Mister.
-Yes?

01:22:52.041 --> 01:22:54.416
Has this shop moved or shut down?

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.750
Gosh, they're scammers, miss.

01:22:56.833 --> 01:22:59.916
A lot of people have been
looking for him since yesterday.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.375
Don't fall for cheap prices.

01:23:06.291 --> 01:23:07.541
Well, excuse me.

01:23:19.916 --> 01:23:22.833
I'm sorry it came to this.

01:23:29.916 --> 01:23:33.791
It's okay, Sally.
You can keep the money for now.

01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:37.791
No. It's not mine to keep.

01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:44.125
Oh, my God, Sally.

01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:48.458
Why didn't you tell me?

01:23:48.541 --> 01:23:49.916
I can't believe it!

01:23:50.541 --> 01:23:52.125
Why should I tell you?

01:23:52.791 --> 01:23:54.666
To make you feel worse?

01:23:56.416 --> 01:23:58.375
Why do you think I do this?

01:23:58.958 --> 01:24:03.916
Because you all told me
to put in effort and live frugally.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:08.916
You should be the ones
looking out for my best interests.

01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:11.916
I shouldn't be worrying about money.

01:24:22.166 --> 01:24:24.791
Sally, I know you're upset.

01:24:26.541 --> 01:24:29.583
But you shouldn't say that to your dad.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.166
I understand

01:24:35.416 --> 01:24:39.125
you've always taught us

01:24:40.166 --> 01:24:41.666
to value money,

01:24:42.541 --> 01:24:43.916
but this is tough.

01:24:46.416 --> 01:24:49.125
I've tried, been careful,

01:24:49.208 --> 01:24:52.041
worked hard, but I still failed.

01:25:02.916 --> 01:25:04.166
It's okay.

01:25:04.666 --> 01:25:06.291
I envy you, Mom.

01:25:07.666 --> 01:25:12.416
You're always the one stepping up
to deal with problems in our family.

01:25:14.541 --> 01:25:15.416
I tried…

01:25:17.791 --> 01:25:21.041
I tried to be like you,

01:25:22.208 --> 01:25:23.833
but I couldn't.

01:25:25.666 --> 01:25:27.291
I'm ashamed of myself.

01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:34.750
Sally.

01:25:37.916 --> 01:25:40.208
I'm strong because of all of you.

01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:44.291
Because of you.

01:25:49.416 --> 01:25:50.541
Easy.

01:25:55.041 --> 01:25:56.291
I'm sorry that

01:25:57.291 --> 01:26:00.041
I haven't been able to give you the best.

01:26:02.541 --> 01:26:04.750
But luck

01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:07.583
follows hard work.

01:26:08.791 --> 01:26:14.166
If we tried but still failed,

01:26:16.791 --> 01:26:18.416
it's just not our time yet.

01:26:29.291 --> 01:26:31.166
Failure doesn't mean defeat.

01:26:33.916 --> 01:26:37.791
You only lose when you stop trying.

01:26:47.166 --> 01:26:48.666
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:26:50.166 --> 01:26:52.166
I didn't mean to say that.

01:26:54.416 --> 01:26:57.791
You've given your best for all of us.

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:09.916
I do apologize.

01:27:14.791 --> 01:27:15.916
All right.

01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:19.125
Sir.

01:27:21.666 --> 01:27:22.666
Thank you.

01:27:53.041 --> 01:27:56.166
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you peace.

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.166
The rest of my bonus.

01:28:12.916 --> 01:28:14.291
It's paid in full.

01:28:19.666 --> 01:28:21.041
Thank God.

01:28:26.291 --> 01:28:27.291
Let's count it.

01:28:40.041 --> 01:28:41.166
We're

01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:44.166
still short 18 million.

01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:45.666
Use the emergency funds.

01:28:46.291 --> 01:28:47.958
What funds?

01:28:48.625 --> 01:28:49.666
There's nothing.

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:52.541
Moving is pointless
if we can't afford food.

01:28:53.416 --> 01:28:54.541
The investment.

01:28:55.291 --> 01:28:56.166
What?

01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:58.291
We still have investments?

01:29:00.666 --> 01:29:03.291
Kids. Mom wants to tell you something.

01:29:04.875 --> 01:29:06.333
JAKARTA PANDEMONIUM
OCTOBER 2021

01:29:06.416 --> 01:29:09.666
The coronavirus
has affected not only health,

01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:11.916
but also weakened the economy.

01:29:12.916 --> 01:29:16.958
People at work are saying if things don't
change for the next two or three years,

01:29:17.041 --> 01:29:19.916
we might face another financial crisis.

01:29:21.541 --> 01:29:23.458
Let's hope not. Seriously?

01:29:23.541 --> 01:29:24.458
I'm serious.

01:29:25.166 --> 01:29:28.541
So they put all their savings into crypto.

01:29:29.291 --> 01:29:33.541
Remember how impossible it was to get
money out of the bank during the crisis?

01:29:34.541 --> 01:29:35.583
Do you remember?

01:29:35.666 --> 01:29:39.916
You can cash out crypto whenever,
and it's simple.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.875
That's why it's booming right now.

01:29:42.958 --> 01:29:44.833
Is it safe?

01:29:45.916 --> 01:29:48.208
It must be risky.

01:29:48.291 --> 01:29:51.416
But if we invest for a short time,

01:29:52.041 --> 01:29:52.916
it's safe.

01:29:53.541 --> 01:29:54.625
Okay.

01:29:56.916 --> 01:29:58.041
Let's do it.

01:29:58.125 --> 01:30:01.541
But let's stick to the plan.

01:30:04.916 --> 01:30:08.541
Once the investment goes up, we cash out.

01:30:09.291 --> 01:30:13.041
Don't stay too long, don't be greedy.

01:30:14.916 --> 01:30:15.791
Aye, aye.

01:30:17.166 --> 01:30:20.041
If it works out,

01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:24.166
the profit isn't just for us,
but for our children too.

01:30:25.416 --> 01:30:26.916
-Right?
-Let's see.

01:30:29.833 --> 01:30:32.333
BITCOIN TANKED

01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:36.208
Bitcoin's value has been under scrutiny
after its price kept falling.

01:30:36.291 --> 01:30:39.791
Over the past 24 hours,
it has dropped over 10%.

01:30:39.875 --> 01:30:42.916
This trend is expected to continue.

01:30:44.458 --> 01:30:45.625
BITCOIN FALLS

01:30:45.708 --> 01:30:47.416
Honey, is this a joke?

01:30:51.916 --> 01:30:53.666
We're down to 20 million

01:30:55.041 --> 01:30:56.791
from 80 million!

01:30:58.291 --> 01:31:00.166
I don't get it either, Lin.

01:31:01.041 --> 01:31:03.833
Everyone at the office is freaking out,

01:31:03.916 --> 01:31:06.083
many are selling at a loss.

01:31:07.666 --> 01:31:09.166
And we're not selling?

01:31:10.041 --> 01:31:11.416
What if it drops even more?

01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:16.541
I was going to do that,
but they said not to panic,

01:31:18.291 --> 01:31:19.916
just hold.

01:31:20.791 --> 01:31:23.708
It should go up again
in two to three weeks.

01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:24.791
Is that possible?

01:31:26.416 --> 01:31:27.750
Yeah.

01:31:27.833 --> 01:31:31.208
They said this kind of thing
happens all the time.

01:31:34.166 --> 01:31:35.541
What do you think?

01:31:38.291 --> 01:31:41.291
I don't care about profits anymore,

01:31:42.041 --> 01:31:43.291
I just…

01:31:45.541 --> 01:31:47.916
want to recover our savings.

01:31:49.458 --> 01:31:51.291
I trust you, honey.

01:31:51.375 --> 01:31:54.916
But if you get this wrong…

01:31:58.666 --> 01:32:00.166
we're doomed.

01:32:06.416 --> 01:32:08.791
You never said anything about this.

01:32:09.416 --> 01:32:11.416
And now that's all the money left?

01:32:12.083 --> 01:32:15.708
So what was the point of me
being used as child labor,

01:32:15.791 --> 01:32:17.166
being underfed,

01:32:17.791 --> 01:32:19.333
and nearly dropping out of school?

01:32:21.541 --> 01:32:24.583
That amount could've sent me
to college abroad.

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:29.791
I'm not sure about that.

01:32:30.541 --> 01:32:32.583
Not because of the money,

01:32:32.666 --> 01:32:35.708
but because of your brain capacity.

01:32:36.416 --> 01:32:41.166
Unless by "abroad" you mean
some remote village in Cambodia.

01:32:41.916 --> 01:32:43.041
Billy's right.

01:32:43.708 --> 01:32:46.708
After being so frugal,
we're getting poorer instead of richer.

01:32:48.166 --> 01:32:49.708
Don't say that, Sally.

01:32:49.791 --> 01:32:53.458
This has nothing to do with frugal living.

01:32:56.458 --> 01:32:59.750
Let's just accept this as bad luck.

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:05.666
I promise to return your college savings.

01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:10.416
But before that, I want to apologize.

01:33:11.291 --> 01:33:12.916
Would it be okay

01:33:14.583 --> 01:33:18.291
if I used the rest of the money
for something very important?

01:33:18.958 --> 01:33:20.791
I told you before, Dad.

01:33:21.791 --> 01:33:23.625
I can pursue college in other ways.

01:33:26.666 --> 01:33:27.875
It's a tough decision.

01:33:28.666 --> 01:33:32.750
I guess I have to
make sacrifices for this family.

01:33:34.083 --> 01:33:38.291
Besides, college isn't
a guarantee of success.

01:33:43.041 --> 01:33:45.041
How can I say this, Billy?

01:33:45.916 --> 01:33:48.958
Thank you so much for your sacrifice.

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:54.291
But no matter what,

01:33:54.875 --> 01:33:57.416
you have to go to college. Got it?

01:33:57.916 --> 01:33:58.750
Yeah.

01:33:59.916 --> 01:34:01.291
College is important.

01:34:02.541 --> 01:34:03.791
Don't even try.

01:34:06.916 --> 01:34:07.791
Lin.

01:34:09.916 --> 01:34:12.541
Maya. As I promised.

01:34:16.291 --> 01:34:17.458
For a full year.

01:34:22.291 --> 01:34:25.750
I… don't know how to tell you.

01:34:26.666 --> 01:34:27.500
Lin.

01:34:28.166 --> 01:34:30.208
I'm really sorry.

01:34:30.916 --> 01:34:32.625
The house has been taken by someone.

01:34:32.708 --> 01:34:35.416
No. You promised me.

01:34:36.083 --> 01:34:38.458
I brought the money as promised.

01:34:38.541 --> 01:34:41.083
My boss handled the deal.

01:34:41.166 --> 01:34:44.541
This person is paying more.

01:34:45.291 --> 01:34:48.833
After you came with me
to see the house the other day,

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:50.708
he suddenly changed his mind.

01:34:50.791 --> 01:34:54.208
He said the neighborhood is nice
and the neighbors are caring.

01:34:54.291 --> 01:34:56.416
I didn't know what to do.

01:34:57.666 --> 01:34:59.375
I'm sorry, Linda.

01:35:00.666 --> 01:35:02.916
I think I know who said that.

01:35:25.541 --> 01:35:26.416
Hey…

01:35:27.166 --> 01:35:28.166
Honey.

01:35:33.666 --> 01:35:34.916
How did it go?

01:35:40.416 --> 01:35:41.291
Oh, no.

01:35:43.541 --> 01:35:45.875
Someone was willing to pay more rent

01:35:47.291 --> 01:35:50.416
because the neighborhood is nice,

01:35:51.541 --> 01:35:53.083
the neighbors are caring.

01:35:53.166 --> 01:35:55.791
And there's a top school nearby.

01:35:59.041 --> 01:36:01.541
That's it, then. Game over.

01:36:16.333 --> 01:36:18.375
We were so close.

01:36:29.125 --> 01:36:31.000
You took those pictures?

01:36:31.666 --> 01:36:36.333
Considering my intellectual capacity,

01:36:36.416 --> 01:36:39.416
I should be the one
shaping historical moments,

01:36:40.041 --> 01:36:42.166
not just capturing them.

01:36:51.916 --> 01:36:54.083
This is all my fault.

01:36:55.541 --> 01:36:56.375
Hey.

01:36:57.916 --> 01:36:59.666
Don't say that, honey.

01:37:00.416 --> 01:37:01.875
This is my fault.

01:37:02.458 --> 01:37:05.458
Being the head of the family,

01:37:05.541 --> 01:37:08.208
it's my duty to work and earn a living.

01:37:08.291 --> 01:37:10.416
-My responsibility.
-No, honey.

01:37:11.291 --> 01:37:15.125
Yes, it's your duty,
but that's not the problem.

01:37:15.708 --> 01:37:20.916
We should've started a mortgage
to buy that house at the beginning.

01:37:21.708 --> 01:37:23.958
Why didn't you?

01:37:24.041 --> 01:37:25.416
Exactly.

01:37:26.041 --> 01:37:31.541
Back then, I didn't see
the point of buying a house.

01:37:31.625 --> 01:37:35.333
Renting was convenient, it was affordable.

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:40.333
And the extra cash could go toward
living costs, savings…

01:37:40.916 --> 01:37:42.208
And crypto investments.

01:37:46.791 --> 01:37:48.125
Sorry.

01:37:49.791 --> 01:37:52.958
The main thing was convenience.

01:37:53.041 --> 01:37:58.166
I got so caught up in it
that I didn't plan ahead.

01:37:58.916 --> 01:38:01.291
And look at us now.

01:38:02.791 --> 01:38:04.541
Living here.

01:38:10.375 --> 01:38:12.750
Don't dwell on it.

01:38:14.416 --> 01:38:15.916
What's done is done.

01:38:17.791 --> 01:38:20.916
There's no need to fear or worry.

01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:28.708
No matter what, we're still a family.

01:38:29.291 --> 01:38:31.125
We're here now,

01:38:32.541 --> 01:38:33.875
in this house.

01:38:35.166 --> 01:38:37.083
The main thing is "us."

01:38:47.791 --> 01:38:49.416
That's clever, Kenny.

01:38:52.125 --> 01:38:53.375
You kids are amazing.

01:38:57.291 --> 01:39:00.208
So what if we live here
for the time being?

01:39:02.166 --> 01:39:05.083
We have the money to renovate it, right?

01:39:05.166 --> 01:39:06.750
-Exactly.
-Okay.

01:39:07.666 --> 01:39:08.833
In that case…

01:39:11.541 --> 01:39:13.208
We'll stay in this house.

01:39:19.458 --> 01:39:20.625
This is bad.

01:39:20.708 --> 01:39:22.000
What is?

01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:27.916
Rozak told me Haji Jaul is signing
the lease tonight. That's soon.

01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:30.083
Does anyone know Engkong's house?

01:39:30.166 --> 01:39:31.083
I know.

01:39:32.625 --> 01:39:33.958
But I don't remember the way.

01:39:34.041 --> 01:39:34.958
Oh, man…

01:39:35.041 --> 01:39:37.375
Come on. I know every alley around here.

01:39:37.458 --> 01:39:39.083
-Okay.
-Great. Let's find Engkong.

01:39:39.166 --> 01:39:40.541
Let's get going.

01:39:41.625 --> 01:39:45.166
From here, we go to the badminton court.

01:39:45.250 --> 01:39:46.875
Straight and turn right.

01:39:47.916 --> 01:39:51.416
-From here, find the power post.
-Turn right at the crossroads.

01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:55.041
It gets tricky here.

01:39:55.708 --> 01:39:57.541
I don't remember the exact spot,

01:39:58.041 --> 01:40:00.750
but there was a smell of cat poop.

01:40:00.833 --> 01:40:03.291
Mrs. Romlah has a lot of cats.

01:40:03.375 --> 01:40:05.291
Go straight and turn left.

01:40:11.041 --> 01:40:11.958
It's true.

01:40:12.041 --> 01:40:13.166
Here!

01:40:14.125 --> 01:40:17.833
-This is it? This is Engkong's house?
-Yes. Yes, Mom. Look.

01:40:17.916 --> 01:40:18.833
Engkong!

01:40:19.541 --> 01:40:20.583
Engkong!

01:40:20.666 --> 01:40:22.708
-So quiet.
-Billy! Watch out.

01:40:22.791 --> 01:40:24.166
Billy!

01:40:25.291 --> 01:40:26.708
-What are you doing?
-Rozak.

01:40:27.291 --> 01:40:28.583
I want to see Engkong.

01:40:28.666 --> 01:40:31.666
You're off. That's not his house.

01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:33.791
It's over there.

01:40:35.250 --> 01:40:36.208
But…

01:40:36.291 --> 01:40:38.625
That's Ali's house.

01:40:39.208 --> 01:40:41.083
The guy that passed away?

01:40:41.166 --> 01:40:42.333
Yeah.

01:40:42.416 --> 01:40:43.750
Who played ping-pong?

01:40:43.833 --> 01:40:46.208
Yeah, the one that died in that--

01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:47.833
Okay, thanks.

01:40:48.916 --> 01:40:50.666
-Come on.
-Let's go.

01:40:52.791 --> 01:40:54.291
Sign there.

01:40:54.875 --> 01:40:55.708
Engkong.

01:40:55.791 --> 01:40:57.833
Take off your sandals. Peace be upon you.

01:40:57.916 --> 01:40:59.833
-And upon you peace.
-And upon you peace.

01:40:59.916 --> 01:41:00.916
Hi.

01:41:01.916 --> 01:41:03.958
-Everyone, say hi.
-The entire family?

01:41:04.041 --> 01:41:05.583
-Engkong.
-Yes, hello.

01:41:05.666 --> 01:41:07.416
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you peace.

01:41:08.166 --> 01:41:10.208
Listen, Engkong.

01:41:10.791 --> 01:41:11.666
I…

01:41:15.583 --> 01:41:17.833
-We--
-Spit it out!

01:41:17.916 --> 01:41:20.666
Don't waste my time. Hurry up.

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.750
I'm doing business with Jaul.

01:41:27.291 --> 01:41:29.541
We want to extend the lease.

01:41:29.625 --> 01:41:31.500
Are you serious?

01:41:32.416 --> 01:41:34.666
You said the place was in bad shape

01:41:35.416 --> 01:41:37.291
and you accused me of chasing profit.

01:41:38.041 --> 01:41:40.541
Yes, I admit I was wrong.

01:41:41.833 --> 01:41:44.000
I was exhausted at the time,

01:41:44.583 --> 01:41:48.875
and the roof collapse was such a shock.
Thankfully, no one got hurt.

01:41:50.041 --> 01:41:52.166
Still, as bad as that house was,

01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:54.833
that house gave us a second chance.

01:41:57.583 --> 01:42:00.083
We decided together to fix up the house.

01:42:01.041 --> 01:42:03.708
Not for your profit,

01:42:03.791 --> 01:42:06.166
but for ourselves.

01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:07.750
I swear.

01:42:10.041 --> 01:42:11.750
I'm sorry, Engkong.

01:42:13.541 --> 01:42:14.791
I forgive you.

01:42:15.791 --> 01:42:18.958
But I handed over the lease to Jaul.

01:42:19.041 --> 01:42:20.208
Now what?

01:42:24.916 --> 01:42:28.833
It's better to let
a family in need live there.

01:42:28.916 --> 01:42:30.333
It keeps us in their prayers.

01:42:30.916 --> 01:42:32.166
Thank God.

01:42:33.041 --> 01:42:35.833
Now, listen to me.

01:42:35.916 --> 01:42:37.541
Go ahead and renovate the house.

01:42:38.291 --> 01:42:39.666
But make sure

01:42:41.541 --> 01:42:43.416
you thank Jaul.

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:44.333
Jaul.

01:42:45.291 --> 01:42:46.458
You okay with it?

01:42:49.041 --> 01:42:51.541
Yes, ma'am. You can have it.

01:42:52.208 --> 01:42:53.916
Thank you so much.

01:42:58.208 --> 01:42:59.583
Say thanks, everyone.

01:42:59.666 --> 01:43:00.833
Thank you, Haji Jaul.

01:43:00.916 --> 01:43:02.041
Thank you.

01:43:02.541 --> 01:43:03.416
Yes…

01:43:07.041 --> 01:43:10.958
We were so close to being homeless.

01:43:11.041 --> 01:43:12.833
-Thank God.
-Right.

01:43:12.916 --> 01:43:14.916
We pulled through.

01:43:25.875 --> 01:43:27.750
-Steady, Billy.
-Watch the stairs.

01:43:27.833 --> 01:43:28.666
Need a hand?

01:43:29.291 --> 01:43:30.125
I can do it.

01:43:30.625 --> 01:43:32.083
You don't need my help?

01:43:33.416 --> 01:43:34.708
Turn around.

01:43:34.791 --> 01:43:35.791
You resigned?

01:43:35.875 --> 01:43:38.125
You think I'll get upset? Nope.

01:43:38.208 --> 01:43:39.541
I'm fine.

01:43:39.625 --> 01:43:41.458
We can do light renovations,

01:43:41.541 --> 01:43:45.375
make this place feel more like home

01:43:45.458 --> 01:43:48.000
while you look for a new job.

01:43:49.541 --> 01:43:51.125
It's a tight fit.

01:43:51.208 --> 01:43:53.583
Yeah, it's a bit tight.

01:43:57.291 --> 01:43:58.291
Oh, no.

01:43:59.041 --> 01:44:00.833
Thank God it didn't snap.

01:44:09.916 --> 01:44:13.791
Our own home

01:45:15.166 --> 01:45:16.416
Sis.

01:45:17.916 --> 01:45:19.541
What happened to you?

01:45:19.625 --> 01:45:24.166
I didn't take the civil servant test.
I didn't feel like it.

01:45:24.791 --> 01:45:26.916
Mom got upset and told me

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.166
I should leave and never come back.

01:45:29.250 --> 01:45:30.166
So I ran away.

01:45:30.833 --> 01:45:32.666
She always gets upset for no reason.

01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:34.291
Who wouldn't?

01:45:35.291 --> 01:45:36.625
I'd be upset too!

01:45:37.791 --> 01:45:38.833
Cipto,

01:45:38.916 --> 01:45:42.166
Mom worked hard
to network and talk to people

01:45:42.666 --> 01:45:44.041
for you to take that test.

01:45:44.125 --> 01:45:47.000
You know I can only work according
to my passion.

01:45:47.083 --> 01:45:48.708
Being a civil servant is not it.

01:45:48.791 --> 01:45:51.208
Passion shmassion.

01:45:51.291 --> 01:45:53.125
What even is your passion?

01:45:54.250 --> 01:45:57.333
You took a machinery course,
then you got bored.

01:45:57.416 --> 01:46:02.000
Then you said, "Mom, my friend
works in Bangkok. It sounds fun."

01:46:02.083 --> 01:46:03.458
It is fun.

01:46:03.541 --> 01:46:07.375
Really? Mom even sold her land for that.

01:46:07.458 --> 01:46:10.541
No need to bring up the past.

01:46:11.208 --> 01:46:14.125
I just need help,
I don't have anyone else.

01:46:17.291 --> 01:46:18.333
Have you eaten?

01:46:19.166 --> 01:46:20.083
No.

01:46:20.166 --> 01:46:21.666
But you do eat, right?

01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:23.083
Yeah.

01:46:25.541 --> 01:46:28.041
Go ahead and lie down.

01:46:28.125 --> 01:46:30.666
Your sister and I will talk.

01:46:31.416 --> 01:46:33.416
We'll discuss this again.

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:36.208
I don't want to be a freeloader.

01:46:36.291 --> 01:46:39.125
If I can, I'll help with anything.

01:46:39.208 --> 01:46:40.416
Good.

01:46:45.916 --> 01:46:47.541
No way.

01:46:48.291 --> 01:46:49.125
No.

01:46:52.416 --> 01:46:53.833
Give it a shot.

01:46:54.416 --> 01:46:59.708
Remind him, he must work and contribute.

01:47:00.291 --> 01:47:03.541
We can make it work.

01:47:03.625 --> 01:47:05.833
-He's your little brother. Poor guy.
-Honey.

01:47:05.916 --> 01:47:08.791
Yes, thank you.

01:47:10.166 --> 01:47:14.166
But look, you're committed,

01:47:14.833 --> 01:47:20.166
with real experience and qualifications.

01:47:20.958 --> 01:47:22.791
Yet you have a hard time finding a job.

01:47:23.291 --> 01:47:25.416
What about him?

01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:57.541
WELCOME
TO OUR GUESTS

01:47:59.250 --> 01:48:01.375
CONGRATULATIONS & GOOD LUCK
ON THE OPENING OF HEPI MART

01:48:05.916 --> 01:48:08.583
Welcome to Hepi Mart,
always happy, always smart!

01:48:08.666 --> 01:48:09.625
How can I help you?

01:48:09.708 --> 01:48:11.208
Maybe later.

01:48:11.291 --> 01:48:13.166
Can I look around first?

01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:14.291
Yes, ma'am.

01:48:18.916 --> 01:48:20.875
You don't have any promos or discounts?

01:48:20.958 --> 01:48:23.333
Normally yes, at the start of the month.

01:48:23.416 --> 01:48:26.708
To attract more people
doing monthly shopping.

01:48:28.166 --> 01:48:32.041
Then, I'll buy later when it's discounted.

01:48:32.541 --> 01:48:34.041
Isn't that right?

01:48:37.083 --> 01:48:38.541
BUSINESS AND PROPERTY

01:48:40.291 --> 01:48:41.291
You're back to shop?

01:48:41.375 --> 01:48:42.916
Mom!

01:48:44.458 --> 01:48:45.416
I left my kid.

01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:46.916
Please pay for the magazine.

01:48:48.166 --> 01:48:50.958
Kenny… That's enough, Ken.

01:48:51.041 --> 01:48:52.958
No!

01:48:53.541 --> 01:48:55.500
Ma'am, please pay.

01:48:55.583 --> 01:48:56.500
He opened it.

01:48:57.166 --> 01:48:58.625
Now I have to read it.

01:49:04.083 --> 01:49:07.708
Boom. Pass!

01:49:07.791 --> 01:49:10.416
-Shoot!
-Goal!

01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.291
What?

01:49:12.375 --> 01:49:14.166
What are you doing there?

01:49:14.666 --> 01:49:15.750
When did you get in?

01:49:16.666 --> 01:49:18.416
Let me cool off.

01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:22.166
Cool off? You think this is the mountains?

01:49:22.250 --> 01:49:25.625
-Get out!
-Give me just ten minutes.

01:49:26.416 --> 01:49:30.541
Get out! I don't care. Don't come back
if you're not here to shop.

01:49:31.125 --> 01:49:32.708
My armpits are still wet.

01:49:32.791 --> 01:49:34.166
I don't care.

01:49:34.250 --> 01:49:37.166
Ask your mom for money
then come back here to shop.

01:49:46.666 --> 01:49:49.791
The total is Rp19,850.

01:49:51.333 --> 01:49:53.833
I'll give you candy for the change.

01:49:53.916 --> 01:49:56.916
So I can pay with candy too?

01:49:59.791 --> 01:50:00.833
Please wait.

01:50:01.416 --> 01:50:02.250
Wait.

01:50:03.791 --> 01:50:04.666
No head.

01:50:05.541 --> 01:50:06.458
No bones.

01:50:11.208 --> 01:50:12.041
Thanks.

01:50:18.791 --> 01:50:21.791
Sorry for the wait. Here you go.

01:50:23.333 --> 01:50:24.458
Where's the Rp50?

01:50:24.541 --> 01:50:26.125
Rp50?

01:50:26.208 --> 01:50:28.166
The change is Rp150.

01:50:28.791 --> 01:50:30.125
This is just Rp100.

01:50:30.791 --> 01:50:32.583
Do you mind donating it?

01:50:32.666 --> 01:50:34.291
What donation?

01:50:34.375 --> 01:50:36.958
For me. I got tired trying to find coins.

01:50:37.666 --> 01:50:38.583
No way.

01:50:39.666 --> 01:50:40.750
Please wait.

01:50:46.416 --> 01:50:47.833
Here's the money.

01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:50.125
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:51.583
My turn.

01:50:52.625 --> 01:50:54.291
-Careful.
-Thank you.

01:51:01.166 --> 01:51:02.250
Sorry.

01:51:02.333 --> 01:51:04.666
I went to every bank,

01:51:05.541 --> 01:51:08.291
they don't even produce 50 rupiah anymore.

01:51:08.375 --> 01:51:12.000
Then why did you put Rp50 in the price?

01:51:12.083 --> 01:51:14.583
I have no idea either.

01:51:15.166 --> 01:51:16.708
Here.

01:51:16.791 --> 01:51:18.041
Here you go.

01:51:18.125 --> 01:51:19.208
A discount.

01:51:19.291 --> 01:51:21.291
Now it's Rp19,800.

01:51:21.375 --> 01:51:23.416
I've been waiting since noon.

01:51:24.041 --> 01:51:25.958
This is the best discount you can give?

01:51:26.041 --> 01:51:26.958
Fine.

01:51:27.041 --> 01:51:29.416
Here, just take it.

01:51:30.833 --> 01:51:33.250
And take this too.

01:51:33.333 --> 01:51:34.958

Win-win solution?

01:51:40.375 --> 01:51:42.666
You won and I got no solution!

01:51:44.791 --> 01:51:47.458
