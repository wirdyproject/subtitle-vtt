3
00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.080
Mom…

4
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.160
Someday, I will go to India

5
00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.680
to meet Dad.

6
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.320
Yes.

7
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.120
When you go to India,

8
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.319
I'll write a letter to your dad.

9
00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.600
What letter, Mom?

10
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.800
To remind him that you're his daughter.

11
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.119
If I meet him,

12
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.399
I'll take him home with me.

13
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.360
I'd really like that.

14
00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.839
I love that. I'm really happy.

15
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.640
Uli!

16
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.120
That's Rhoma Irama's entourage!

17
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.880
Mr. Rhoma!

18
00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.120
Mr. Rhoma!

19
00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:52.600
Mr. Rhoma!

20
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.560
Magic hand.

21
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.560
Thank you, Mr. Rhoma.

22
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.440
Praise be to God.

23
00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.840
I'm not lying!

24
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.640
Really, ma'am!

25
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.959
But my dad really is Amitabh Bachan.

26
00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.640
Calm down, class!

27
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.760
My dad is indeed Amitabh Bachan!

28
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.239
You're all just jealous!

29
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.440
My dad is Mr. Harto.

30
00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.200
Wrong!

31
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.200
Brother!

32
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.760
They're making fun of me again!

33
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.760
My dad is Amitabh Bachan. Nehi nehi.

34
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.080
Nehi nehi.

35
00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.400
You're crazy, Devi!

36
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.200
Hey!

37
00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:48.800
Hey!

38
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.440
Her mom is even crazier.

39
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.919
You're crazy too, Uli. Just like Devi!

40
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.440
-Crazy!
-Crazy!

41
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.479
-Crazy!
-Crazy!

42
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.440
Amitabh Bachan has never been to Kerinci.

43
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.760
There's no way you're her daughter.

44
00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:14.960
Don't you dare!

45
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.159
Let's go!

46
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.719
It's okay, Devi. Don't be sad.

47
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.240
I told them to leave.

48
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.200
Uli, you should report Jefri
to the teacher.

49
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.680
I'll take Devi home.

50
00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:48.919
Forget it, girl.

51
00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.560
They're just jealous of you.

52
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.880
They think I'm crazy.

53
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.320
If you were,

54
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.479
there's no way you could
get good grades at school.

55
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.120
My teacher thinks so too.

56
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.359
I remember…

57
00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.000
When you were a baby and I carried you,

58
00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.479
you pointed at Amitabh Bachan's photo.

59
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.039
I asked,

60
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.560
"Do you want to see Dad?

61
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.960
Do you? You want to see him?"

62
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.440
You nodded.

63
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.760
You were happy.

64
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.880
Then I said,

65
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.840
"It's hard to meet your dad, honey.

66
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.039
He's busy filming."

67
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.039
Then you frowned.

68
00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.880
You have had a strong bond with your dad

69
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.240
since you were a baby.

70
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.159
So, it can't be wrong, Devi.

71
00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.080
Your dad is indeed Amitabh Bachan.

72
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.039
You're not lying, right?

73
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.560
No, Devi.

74
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.479
Why don't you believe me?

75
00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:01.880
It must be all that school gossip
from your friends.

76
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.200
If they don't believe it,

77
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.799
they're not your friends.

78
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.080
Hey, don't be too loud!

79
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.440
Bruce Lee is on a rampage!

80
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.359
Dad!

81
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.960
What?

82
00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:44.159
Please tell my brother not to be so loud.

83
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.400
You can write songs in your room.

84
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.359
Mr. Rhoma doesn't want that.

85
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.000
He likes it here.

86
00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:59.080
He does. Let me talk to him.

87
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.760
Peace be upon you, Mr. Rhoma.

88
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.679
Can you help me?

89
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.919
Can you help Uli write a song in his room?

90
00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:26.599
Of course.

91
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.359
He can help you.

92
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.760
Please teach me how to write songs.

93
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880
When…

94
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.800
Ouch…

95
00:08:57.439 --> 00:08:58.680
Do I look handsome now?

96
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.319
Where are you going?

97
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.280
I want to watch Devi practice dancing.

98
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.000
She's happy when I come.

99
00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.160
I want to join!

100
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.520
No!

101
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.480
Why?

102
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.160
You'll be annoying.

103
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.560
Do I look handsome?

104
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.400
You nodded earlier!

105
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.000
Thank God, I'm more handsome.

106
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.120
Your hips, Devi.

107
00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:40.760
The wind blows

108
00:09:40.839 --> 00:09:44.520
Heart swept away

109
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:50.720
A happy tone without an atmosphere

110
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.120
Call his name

111
00:09:53.199 --> 00:09:56.560
You must be complacent

112
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.439
Look at his figure

113
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.360
You'll be amazed

114
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.839
He exists without force

115
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:16.880
He's close to you there

116
00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:23.079
I accept everything

117
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.280
Amitabh, this is your daughter
Devi Bachan

118
00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:42.920
Amitabh, this is your daughter
Devi Bachan

119
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.240
Now we do the lotus movement.
One, two, three, four, five, six…

120
00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:50.079
-Is that Brother Emir?
-…seven, eight.

121
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.680
Mom, he always peeks when I practice.

122
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.079
Come in, Emir.

123
00:11:01.719 --> 00:11:03.120
How's your kung fu?

124
00:11:03.719 --> 00:11:06.199
It's getting better. Bruce Lee trained me.

125
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.719
If only I were like you.

126
00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:18.800
Don't feel sorry for yourself.

127
00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.120
But I do feel that way.

128
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.800
I have an idea.

129
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.839
From now on,

130
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.240
we have to save up until we grow up.

131
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.480
What for?

132
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.800
To go to India!

133
00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:42.079
Emir, Mom and I were
just talking about that.

134
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.480
Right. We'll collect the lottery tickets,
but you're the one buying them.

135
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.439
-Buy a lot?
-Yes, a lot!

136
00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:52.240
Mom!

137
00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:56.319
He wants to help me save money
to go to India.

138
00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.400
He wants to go to India with me.

139
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.680
Are you going to India with Devi?

140
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.600
Yes. I will save every penny I receive.

141
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.920
I'll even save my pocket money
to go to India with Devi.

142
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.280
I will also help you, Devi.

143
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.680
Thank you. I am so happy, Emir.

144
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.240
This is for your dad, okay?

145
00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:21.880
Thank you, Auntie.

146
00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:24.439
That's taro curry, your dad's favorite.

147
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.920
Thank you, Emir.

148
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
But now, I want to continue practicing.

149
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.640
Emir!

150
00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:35.160
I want to keep practicing!

151
00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.760
Excuse me, Auntie.

152
00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:40.680
Say hello to your mom. And Uli too.

153
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.000
Emir!

154
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.520
You have to be serious
if you want to go to India.

155
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.400
Okay? I will also save money for you.

156
00:12:57.439 --> 00:12:58.640
Now what do you want?

157
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.480
Continue practicing.

158
00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:02.439
Then I want to study. How about you?

159
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.280
I'm tired, Devi. I want to rest.

160
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.839
Uli.

161
00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:33.599
I want to go to India with Devi.

162
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.040
To India?

163
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.959
Yes.

164
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.880
Devi really wants to go to India
to meet her dad.

165
00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:41.760
Where's the money going to come from?

166
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.880
I'll save. I'm entering the lottery.

167
00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:47.760
How's that possible, Emir?

168
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.760
It's possible.

169
00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:52.480
I can enter the lottery for big prizes.

170
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.560
You won't necessarily win.

171
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.839
Uli.

172
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.199
Don't be jealous
because you weren't invited.

173
00:14:00.319 --> 00:14:02.560
I never asked to be invited.

174
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.760
All right then.

175
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.839
You have to stop this, Ida.

176
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.920
Why are you only talking about that now?

177
00:14:33.479 --> 00:14:35.719
There's been enough trauma in my life.

178
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.040
But don't bring Devi into your world.

179
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.520
She needs a father figure.

180
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.280
Who's better than Amitabh Bachan?

181
00:14:54.319 --> 00:14:57.000
Ida, you never think before you speak!

182
00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.000
-Maybe I'm crazy!
-Yes, you are.

183
00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:03.160
-Yes.
-Yes, you've always been crazy!

184
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.880
But I never cared about that.

185
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.000
Since you came here,
I've never had a problem with that, Ida.

186
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.199
But you have to know, we are immigrants.

187
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.719
Be crazy all you want,
just don't drag Devi into it!

188
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.719
She wants to go to India.

189
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.599
Even Emir wants to go too.

190
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.199
I can't imagine
how disappointed they will be.

191
00:15:30.319 --> 00:15:31.439
I'm sick, Brother.

192
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.120
You have to tell Devi

193
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.160
who her real dad is.

194
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.079
No.

195
00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:45.160
-I don't want to destroy their happiness!
-They are not happy, Ida!

196
00:15:46.599 --> 00:15:48.400
They're just making fun of you.

197
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.280
You didn't see it.

198
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.439
Emir even became her knight!

199
00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:57.240
I won't take away their dreams!

200
00:15:57.839 --> 00:16:01.319
You've always been the hardest to talk to.

201
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.439
Emir!

202
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.640
Wake up, Emir!

203
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.959
You're dreaming.

204
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.359
Right, I dreamed that I was possessed
by the spirit of Bruce Lee!

205
00:16:59.439 --> 00:17:01.640
That's because you practice too often.

206
00:17:01.719 --> 00:17:03.479
So, you got a nightmare.

207
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.200
No. That wasn't a nightmare.

208
00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:09.000
All right.

209
00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.720
I want to go back to sleep.

210
00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.919
Mom!

211
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.599
Mom!

212
00:17:43.399 --> 00:17:44.240
Mom!

213
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.480
Mom!

214
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.120
Mom!

215
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.520
Mom!

216
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.320
Mom.

217
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.120
Mom.

218
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.120
I am hungry.

219
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.040
Mom.

220
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.360
Mom.

221
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.960
Wake up, Mom.

222
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.360
Mom?

223
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.320
Wake up, Mom.

224
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.840
Mom.

225
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.320
Mom.

226
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.360
Mom!

227
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.000
Mom!

228
00:18:33.639 --> 00:18:34.840
Wake up, Mom!

229
00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:37.560
Mom!

230
00:18:38.399 --> 00:18:40.520
Wake up, Mom.

231
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.560
Wake up!

232
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.000
Mom!

233
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.840
Mom!

234
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.240
Wake up!

235
00:18:58.159 --> 00:19:00.879
-There is no God but Allah.
-There is no God but Allah.

236
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.560
-There is no God but Allah.
-There is no God but Allah.

237
00:19:05.639 --> 00:19:08.440
-There is no God but Allah.
-There is no God but Allah.

238
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.919
Glory be to your Lord, the Lord
of Might, above what they claim.

239
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.440
All praise belongs to Allah,
Lord of the worlds.

240
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.159
FARIDA BINTI SULAIMAN
BORN: 3-7-1963, DIED: 21-11-1994

241
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.159
It's okay. Don't cry.

242
00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.399
Devi.

243
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.960
Your mom

244
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.080
left this letter for you.

245
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.840
Keep it safe, okay?

246
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.200
MY LETTER FOR AMITABH BACHAN

247
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.440
Isn't that enough?

248
00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.040
Not yet, Uncle.

249
00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.399
Maybe this is a sign for you to give up.

250
00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:05.480
No.

251
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.399
I will not give up.

252
00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.320
Girls your age in Kerinci
already have two kids.

253
00:21:15.639 --> 00:21:17.600
Meanwhile, you're not even thinking
about marriage.

254
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.360
I'm embarrassed to see
you're not married yet.

255
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:22.879
Uncle.

256
00:21:23.639 --> 00:21:27.320
I don't want to get married
before I meet my dad.

257
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.639
He should be the one to marry me off.

258
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.399
If there is no man you like
in this village…

259
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.080
Choose Emir or Uli. Take your pick.

260
00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:42.480
I only want to marry a man
who is willing to fight for me.

261
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.679
Enough, choose one.

262
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.360
I have to go to India, Uncle.

263
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.960
I have to look for my dad.

264
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.280
-Only he is worthy to marry me.
-Whatever.

265
00:21:59.159 --> 00:22:00.040
Whatever!

266
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.240
As long as

267
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.399
you get married.

268
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I'd better go. Emir might get suspicious.

269
00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:27.879
It's time he found out.

270
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.240
Are you crazy?

271
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.040
Emir could get hurt.

272
00:22:34.679 --> 00:22:38.159
How much longer
do we have to lie like this?

273
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.280
I don't know!

274
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.560
But I really don't want
to hurt Emir's feelings.

275
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.560
He has to know, Devi.

276
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.000
I can't stand us dating in secret
like this all the time.

277
00:23:28.639 --> 00:23:29.520
Emir!

278
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.439
Emir!

279
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.200
Where's Uli?

280
00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.040
I am here!

281
00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:40.480
Uli!

282
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.560
Thank goodness,
we've collected all the money!

283
00:23:43.639 --> 00:23:44.919
It's still not enough.

284
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.919
Did you catch anything?

285
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.679
I let them go again.

286
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.960
Why?

287
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.120
Caught, caught

288
00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.960
Then I let you go again

289
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.320
Slipped, slipped

290
00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:03.800
I can't hold on again

291
00:24:03.879 --> 00:24:08.639
You're the darling I serve

292
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:14.320
The crown on my aching heart

293
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.720
I'm torn between choosing you or him

294
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:37.320
And I'm really torn
About which love to choose

295
00:24:37.399 --> 00:24:39.399
One is loyal

296
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:45.879
The other tests my faith

297
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.679
Confused, confused, confused

298
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.919
Caught, caught

299
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.840
Darling, I let you go again

300
00:24:57.919 --> 00:25:02.520
Slipped, slipped
I can't hold on again

301
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.560
You're the darling I serve

302
00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:14.480
The crown on my aching heart

303
00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:20.159
I'm torn between choosing you or him

304
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.520
-You or him
-And I'm really torn

305
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.919
About which love to choose

306
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.320
My heart is captivated

307
00:25:29.399 --> 00:25:35.000
By the love of both

308
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:40.919
-Confused, confused, confused
-Confused, confused, confused

309
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.560
-I'm caught between a rock
-I'm caught between a rock

310
00:25:44.639 --> 00:25:46.879
-And a hard place
-And a hard place

311
00:25:55.159 --> 00:25:56.000
Emir!

312
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.320
Emir, this is enough.

313
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.080
Me too.

314
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.199
We need to get a passport.

315
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.600
I've got the form.

316
00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:14.800
Did you take two forms?

317
00:26:14.879 --> 00:26:15.720
Three.

318
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:23.040
-Why three?
-Try not to give up hope

319
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.800
Open the eyes of your heart

320
00:26:27.879 --> 00:26:30.199
There's nothing wrong
with getting a passport too.

321
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.399
Now I leave it to you

322
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:40.199
To make your choice

323
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.480
Let's get a passport.

324
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.560
No need, Devi.

325
00:26:43.639 --> 00:26:44.960
The money is not enough.

326
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.800
Besides, I can get my own passport.

327
00:26:48.399 --> 00:26:53.199
Why go to India if you can go to America

328
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.960
Why go to India
It's better to stay in Indonesia

329
00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.240
Ouch, ouch, ouch

330
00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.840
Ouch

331
00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:09.120
Devi!

332
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:11.000
Devi.

333
00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.240
Devi.

334
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.560
I'd better go. Emir might get suspicious.

335
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.040
Let him know.

336
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.399
Don't be like that.

337
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.879
Do you have the heart
to leave me alone in Indonesia?

338
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.439
No.

339
00:27:28.399 --> 00:27:30.439
I want you to come along.

340
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.000
But…

341
00:27:35.399 --> 00:27:36.800
It's better for me to go.

342
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.399
Devi!

343
00:27:43.439 --> 00:27:44.280
Devi!

344
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.439
Déjà vu.

345
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.399
Devi!

346
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.919
Are you sure you're going to India?

347
00:28:10.679 --> 00:28:12.080
Why are you asking that now?

348
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.600
I'm just worried.

349
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.280
I'm warning you.

350
00:28:25.199 --> 00:28:27.679
Don't do that! I can look after Devi!

351
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.480
I don't doubt that.

352
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.879
-It's just that you will…
-You have to come too?

353
00:28:35.959 --> 00:28:36.800
No.

354
00:28:37.879 --> 00:28:38.760
You've got it wrong.

355
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.199
Come with me.

356
00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:51.720
Uli, come with me!

357
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.840
Attack!

358
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.240
Attack me!

359
00:29:13.199 --> 00:29:14.399
Emir!

360
00:29:17.399 --> 00:29:18.879
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

361
00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.000
This is wrong!

362
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.600
Uli, don't ever mention India again

363
00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:35.679
because you were never a part of it.

364
00:30:15.879 --> 00:30:17.120
That move was wrong!

365
00:30:18.439 --> 00:30:20.080
-Do you want to become a martial artist?
-Yes!

366
00:30:20.639 --> 00:30:21.879
-Do you?
-Yes!

367
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.000
MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL

368
00:30:32.199 --> 00:30:33.320
Why are you holding up five fingers?

369
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.720
It's two, not five!

370
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.360
Do you understand what it means?

371
00:30:38.439 --> 00:30:39.280
Yes!

372
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.639
One sky, one earth!

373
00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:44.760
Class.

374
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.280
Get some rest.

375
00:31:10.199 --> 00:31:11.040
Uli.

376
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.159
I want to talk to you.

377
00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.679
Where are Emir and Devi?
You're always together.

378
00:31:28.439 --> 00:31:30.120
They are about to leave for India.

379
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.520
You're not going with them?

380
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.159
No.

381
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.320
Why?

382
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.320
Devi, let's go!

383
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.879
Devi!

384
00:31:56.439 --> 00:31:57.280
Yes!

385
00:32:22.199 --> 00:32:23.360
Be patient, Emir.

386
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.159
Uli!

387
00:32:26.919 --> 00:32:29.199
Uli's gone. It's just the two of us.

388
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.399
Does he already know?

389
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.000
How could he forget?

390
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.320
He said he would join us there.

391
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.439
Come on, we'll be late.

392
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.439
Emir.

393
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.560
We won't be late.

394
00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:40.639
Come on.

395
00:32:52.879 --> 00:32:55.120
Actually, I've wanted to talk to you
for a long time.

396
00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.399
Every time you practice,

397
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.439
you always talk about India.

398
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.800
But you are always forgotten.

399
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.040
You always sit quietly
and don't say anything.

400
00:33:07.639 --> 00:33:08.679
Do you remember?

401
00:33:15.719 --> 00:33:16.560
I remember.

402
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.560
Have you started saving?

403
00:33:42.639 --> 00:33:43.560
Yes, I have.

404
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.199
I'm also collecting this lottery.

405
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.040
If I win, we'll have plenty of money
to go to India.

406
00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.399
I can also collect more money than you.

407
00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.600
How?

408
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.439
I could work as a cinema ticket taker

409
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.840
or a booking agent
if Mr. Rhoma wants to perform.

410
00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:05.879
No way they'll let kids be booking agents.

411
00:34:05.959 --> 00:34:07.719
That's only for adults.

412
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.120
Don't make things up!

413
00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:10.639
As long as I don't steal.

414
00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:11.639
Just leave it to me!

415
00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.520
What is it, Emir?

416
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.759
Do you often collect wrappers?

417
00:34:25.839 --> 00:34:27.600
Yes, who knows? I might win.

418
00:34:28.279 --> 00:34:29.199
Same with me.

419
00:34:29.799 --> 00:34:30.639
Really?

420
00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.719
Yes.

421
00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:33.360
-Do you want mine?
-Yes!

422
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.000
Take it after practice, okay?

423
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.120
Devi, we can go to India.

424
00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:39.360
Do you want to go to India?

425
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.279
Yes, to see my dad!

426
00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.279
Amitabh Bachan?

427
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.480
Yes, I hope that you can win.

428
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.360
Uli?

429
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.880
I feel bad seeing you like that.

430
00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.880
Why?

431
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.720
Because I knew
you actually want to go too.

432
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.400
-I love Devi, Master.
-Yes, I know.

433
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.160
How did you know?

434
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:10.520
You were disappointed to see Emir
and Devi collecting the lottery.

435
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.000
-I was also hurt at that time.
-See?

436
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.000
I can collect
more lottery papers than Emir.

437
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.000
Why didn't you do that then?

438
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.400
Did you get discouraged?

439
00:35:24.759 --> 00:35:25.920
Did you?

440
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.319
Maybe…

441
00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.400
I don't know.

442
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.640
You really don't need to worry.

443
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.120
I've wanted to talk about this
for a long time.

444
00:35:37.759 --> 00:35:39.160
But you were all still kids.

445
00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.319
I couldn't bring myself
to crush your dreams.

446
00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.480
Emir with his kung fu and Bruce Lee.

447
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.680
You with your hands and Rhoma Irama.

448
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.160
Do you still have magic hands?

449
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.839
Thank God.

450
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.360
Yes, it still is, Master.

451
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.680
I know exactly who Devi's dad is.

452
00:36:03.759 --> 00:36:04.960
Who?

453
00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.640
It's a shame that Uli didn't come.

454
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.920
He must be angry.

455
00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.960
Maybe he forgot.

456
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.240
It's not too late, Master.

457
00:36:31.319 --> 00:36:32.240
Peace be upon you.

458
00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:36.360
Peace be upon you too.

459
00:36:37.759 --> 00:36:39.319
MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL

460
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.120
Come on, everyone. Let's go.

461
00:36:45.759 --> 00:36:46.600
Let's go.

462
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.960
Wait. The car is full.

463
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.880
Sir, which bus goes to Padang?

464
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.960
It's about to leave.

465
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.160
Devi!

466
00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:09.560
Devi!

467
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.160
Devi!

468
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.759
Emir, what's Uli holding?

469
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.279
Did you leave anything behind?

470
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:21.960
Ignore him.

471
00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:26.000
-Keep going, sir.
-Devi!

472
00:37:27.359 --> 00:37:30.240
Devi!

473
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.120
You left this!

474
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.600
GARDEN RESTAURANT KLIA

475
00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.799
Honey, come on.

476
00:38:04.799 --> 00:38:07.080
-Baby, please.
-What are you doing?

477
00:38:07.759 --> 00:38:09.640
You know that I don't like it

478
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.640
-when you bring up your affair!
-I know.

479
00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.400
-Stop it. I'm embarrassed.
-I don't care.

480
00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.600
I don't like it!

481
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.920
Babe, enough. I'm embarrassed.

482
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.080
Too many people here. Please.

483
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.720
Let everyone know that you are a bastard

484
00:38:22.799 --> 00:38:24.880
who is having an affair
with a Malaysian woman!

485
00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:03.920
Devi.

486
00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.480
Let's eat here.

487
00:39:08.839 --> 00:39:10.960
While we wait for our flight to Mumbai.

488
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.000
You haven't finished the book yet?

489
00:39:23.319 --> 00:39:24.240
Not yet.

490
00:39:25.799 --> 00:39:26.680
You know…

491
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.600
Mumbai is close to Tibet.

492
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.279
Dalai Lama's city.

493
00:39:33.799 --> 00:39:35.400
I am very hungry.

494
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.720
My stomach is growling.

495
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.440
You didn't eat when we were in Padang.

496
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.759
That's why you're hungry now.

497
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.319
It seems like the food at this restaurant

498
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.240
is safe for our stomachs.

499
00:39:51.319 --> 00:39:53.279
Let me order nasi lemak for you.

500
00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.960
They say it's a shame not to try
Malaysian nasi lemak

501
00:39:58.839 --> 00:40:00.480
while we are transiting here.

I can't wait

504
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.799
to see my dad.

505
00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.520
Soon, your dream will come true.

506
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.839
I need to find an ATM.

507
00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.040
It looks like we're running out of money.

508
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.000
MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL
KERINCI TIGER

509
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.520
What are you doing, Uli?

510
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.839
I need to find him.

511
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.759
That's good.

512
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.920
Last I heard, he was in Jakarta.

513
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.319
Do you know where he is in Jakarta?

514
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.000
No.

515
00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:05.480
But you can ask his brother.

516
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.400
-His brother?
-Yes.

517
00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.200
Rafli, her dad's brother.

518
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.839
If her uncle is here,
why hasn't he ever contacted Devi?

519
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.160
He is a quiet person.

520
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.160
Maybe the same as me.

521
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.200
He didn't want to make
the situation even worse.

522
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.920
Calm down. I'll introduce you to him.

523
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.080
Okay?

524
00:41:33.319 --> 00:41:34.319
It's all right.

525
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.000
Are you Indian?

526
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.279
I'm Devi from Kerinci.

527
00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.279
I can't speak Hindi.

528
00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.839
Are you from Indonesia?

529
00:41:57.319 --> 00:41:59.440
I thought you were a real Indian.

530
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.920
I just got back from Jakarta too,

531
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.400
and now I'm heading back to Bombay.

532
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:18.799
Mumbai?

533
00:42:20.279 --> 00:42:21.799
I am going there too.

534
00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.359
I want to meet my dad.

535
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.799
Your dad is Indian?

536
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.240
But I have never met him since I was born.

537
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.080
Here.

538
00:42:40.799 --> 00:42:42.000
I'm a film producer.

539
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.960
And coincidentally,

540
00:42:44.799 --> 00:42:47.240
I'm currently producing
a soap opera in Jakarta.

541
00:42:47.319 --> 00:42:50.920
If you're in film, you must know my dad.

542
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:52.680
Who is your dad?

543
00:42:52.759 --> 00:42:53.680
Amitabh Bachan!

544
00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.200
I didn't expect Mr. Amitabh
to have a daughter in Indonesia.

545
00:43:06.799 --> 00:43:08.200
Mr. Sanjay, let me introduce you.

546
00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.200
This is my cousin, Emir.

547
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.759
Emir.

548
00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.040
I'll excuse myself. See you in Bombay.

549
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.040
My phone number is there.

550
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.279
Mr. Amitabh must be missing you.

551
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.799
Devi, who is that?

552
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.200
Why are you with a man?
I was only gone for a bit.

553
00:43:50.279 --> 00:43:51.720
You must be careful.

554
00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.480
They say

555
00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.240
Indians are more dangerous than snakes!

556
00:43:58.319 --> 00:43:59.600
Emir.

557
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:04.040
It's not good to keep
thinking badly about others.

558
00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:07.720
I can't wait to see Dad.

559
00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.879
God is the Greatest.

560
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.359
God is the Greatest.

561
00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:29.279
God is the Greatest.

562
00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.040
God is the Greatest.

563
00:44:37.279 --> 00:44:38.440
Peace be upon you.

564
00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.759
Peace be upon you.

565
00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.640
I don't want to be rude.

566
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.440
Rude?

567
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.520
It's reckless to interfere
in people's affairs!

568
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.960
-Rafli.
-Roughly, it's like that.

569
00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.560
-You're not the rude type.
-That's why I don't want to be rude.

570
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.080
-Mr. Rafli.
-Roughly, it's like that.

571
00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.879
-Can you help me find Devi's dad?
-I don't want to be rude to Devi.

572
00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.680
No! She won't feel abused.

573
00:45:05.279 --> 00:45:06.680
In fact, we are helping her.

574
00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.279
If he's sure about this,
I'm willing to help.

575
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
I am sure!

576
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.960
God willing.

577
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.839
We have to find her dad then.

578
00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.120
Roughly, where is Devi's dad?

579
00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.520
We'd better ask.

580
00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.640
Roughly, that's how it is, Uli. Get it?

581
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.240
Please drink.

582
00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.040
-How old is the person?
-Twenty.

583
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.480
I mean the one you're looking for!

584
00:46:40.759 --> 00:46:41.839
I don't know.

585
00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.200
Roughly, in his '50s.

586
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.480
Get out!

587
00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.359
-Who?
-You!

588
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.319
-Why?
-I can't think!

589
00:47:01.879 --> 00:47:02.960
Do you use your mind too?

590
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.080
My predictions are scientific.

591
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.480
Get out!

592
00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.560
Peace be upon you.

593
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.680
You're not married yet?

594
00:47:20.759 --> 00:47:21.759
Me?

595
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:22.960
Don't lie.

596
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.080
-I know if you're lying.
-Roughly, not yet.

597
00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.120
Do you like men?

598
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.680
Don't lie. I'd know if you're lying.

599
00:47:30.759 --> 00:47:33.720
-I'm not God, but--
-I don't like men.

600
00:47:33.799 --> 00:47:36.040
-But if there's someone--
-Handsome, you want him too.

601
00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.440
Do you know him?

602
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.359
-Roughly.
-He's in Tibet.

603
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.240
-What do you mean?
-Sobet brebet.

604
00:47:59.319 --> 00:48:03.080
Anyway, there was a big man standing,
pointing at Simpang Empat.

605
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.319
Well, there he is.

606
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.040
Sir.

607
00:50:40.279 --> 00:50:41.720
No one's inside.

608
00:50:41.799 --> 00:50:42.879
Wait!

609
00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.160
Let's go. Let's just find another hotel.

610
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.399
We are not as poor as you think.

611
00:50:50.799 --> 00:50:52.040
When will the staff arrive?

612
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.879
-Sir.
-Wait!

613
00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:58.000
Uli, let's just wait.

614
00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.560
-What does that mean?
-Never.

615
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.560
Is the air conditioner all right?

616
00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.000
Air conditioner?

617
00:51:18.839 --> 00:51:20.000
Yes, it's cold.

618
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:24.920
Do you want one?

619
00:51:26.399 --> 00:51:27.399
No, thank you.

620
00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.319
Sit down.

621
00:51:40.359 --> 00:51:43.799
Today, we will meet
Amitabh Bachan's producer.

622
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.319
Really?

623
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.000
There is nothing difficult for me
in this city.

624
00:51:49.319 --> 00:51:50.279
It's all easy.

625
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.920
I don't know what to say.

626
00:51:54.759 --> 00:51:56.000
You could thank me.

627
00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.640
Thank you.

628
00:52:06.839 --> 00:52:08.080
Your smile is charming.

629
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.480
Thank you.

630
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.399
Perhaps…

631
00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.839
You could become an artist here too.
Do you want to?

632
00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.839
If it's about that, maybe not yet.

633
00:52:21.799 --> 00:52:25.080
I don't even speak English,
let alone Hindi.

634
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.520
But you'd be perfect as an Indian.

635
00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.920
Just look at you.

636
00:52:48.279 --> 00:52:49.120
Thank you.

637
00:52:50.359 --> 00:52:52.960
I've been wearing clothes like this
since I was little.

638
00:52:54.359 --> 00:52:56.799
I was ridiculed, but eventually,
they ignored me.

639
00:53:20.399 --> 00:53:22.560
Come here. Look at the garden.

640
00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.480
It's a beautiful garden.

641
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.560
It would be even more beautiful
if you stood there.

642
00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:10.399
This house belongs
to your dad's ex-girlfriend.

643
00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.799
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

644
00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.480
Emir!

645
00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.319
Come in! Sanjay is inside.

646
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.399
What is he doing inside?

647
00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.480
Come on!

648
00:54:59.839 --> 00:55:00.759
Come on, Emir.

649
00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.440
Please, sit down.

650
00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.080
Sit down, Emir.

651
00:55:09.279 --> 00:55:12.120
All right, I'll take care of the meeting
with Amitabh Bachan then.

652
00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.440
When the time comes, I'll tell Devi.

653
00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:19.240
Right, I forgot!
Maybe you should take care of that first.

654
00:55:25.759 --> 00:55:27.879
I think Devi needs to get ready.

655
00:55:29.799 --> 00:55:32.520
So, don't take too long, okay?

656
00:55:33.279 --> 00:55:35.680
Yes, right. I have to get ready.

657
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.080
You have to look beautiful.

658
00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:04.520
Emir.

659
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.160
Don't frown like that.

660
00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.080
I don't trust him!

661
00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.080
Even after he offered us a place to stay?

662
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.520
When his intentions are so unclear?

663
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.080
Emir, don't be jealous.

664
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.480
I see the way you look at him.

665
00:56:29.839 --> 00:56:31.319
We just arrived.

666
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.200
You're already getting close to him.

667
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.839
You'd better calm down.

668
00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:46.920
Perhaps you're right.

669
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.600
Sanjay.

670
00:57:05.359 --> 00:57:06.799
This place…

671
00:57:06.879 --> 00:57:08.440
This place is too luxurious.

672
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.520
I don't belong here. I'm embarrassed.

673
00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:15.640
Besides, poor Emir is at home alone.

674
00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.000
Stop that, okay?

675
00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.720
Tonight,

676
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.359
you are the most beautiful woman
in Bombay.

677
00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.200
Tonight,

678
00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.680
Goddess Sinta has descended to Earth.

679
00:57:56.359 --> 00:58:01.480
And she has transformed into
a beautiful woman before my eyes.

680
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.480
And I…

681
00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.799
will be cursed by the gods

682
00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:10.839
if I can't give my best

683
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.799
for the incarnation of Goddess Sinta.

684
00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.000
Let's ask them.

685
00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.399
-Sir.
-Yes?

686
00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:00.680
Where's the apartment near here?

687
00:59:00.759 --> 00:59:01.640
There it is.

688
00:59:03.839 --> 00:59:04.919
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

689
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:05.839
Thank you.

690
00:59:17.879 --> 00:59:18.720
Mine.

691
00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.080
Excuse me, sir.

692
00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.200
-Yes?
-Do you know this person?

693
00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:27.359
If I'm not mistaken,
this person lives on the second floor.

694
00:59:27.919 --> 00:59:29.000
-Second floor, right?
-Yes.

695
00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.960
-Try asking again upstairs.
-Okay.

696
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.319
-Thank you.
-Yes, you're welcome.

697
00:59:32.399 --> 00:59:33.359
-Thank you.
-Yes.

698
00:59:34.799 --> 00:59:36.640
This is mine!

699
00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:38.200
-Mine!
-Mine!

700
00:59:38.279 --> 00:59:39.560
Mine!

701
00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:40.560
That's mine!

702
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.160
Miss.

703
00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.040
Miss.

704
00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:49.480
Ma'am!

705
00:59:50.399 --> 00:59:51.279
Ma'am!

706
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.319
-Yes?
-Do you know Mr. Tohir?

707
00:59:54.399 --> 00:59:55.919
People say he lives in this apartment.

708
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.919
-Ohil?
-"Ohil."

709
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.120
-Tohir!
-Ohil.

710
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.399
-Right.
-Here's the photo.

711
01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.279
I know him.

712
01:00:03.359 --> 01:00:06.080
There, the green door with the doll.

713
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.960
-Okay? There.
-Okay.

714
01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.359
-Okay.
-Thank you, miss.

715
01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.480
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Yes.

716
01:00:15.919 --> 01:00:17.279
-Hey!
-Sorry, sir!

717
01:00:17.359 --> 01:00:20.680
Sorry? Ride your bicycle outside,
not in here!

718
01:00:25.319 --> 01:00:26.240
It's the doll.

719
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.120
Peace be upon you.

720
01:00:37.919 --> 01:00:39.279
-Mr. Tohir!
-Uli!

721
01:00:40.919 --> 01:00:41.919
Mr. Tohir!

722
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.160
Mr. Tohir, this is Uli from Kerinci!

723
01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.839
-Father!
-What?

724
01:00:48.919 --> 01:00:51.640
What do you mean? Who are you?

725
01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.759
-Sorry, sir. I'm looking for Mr. Tohir.
-Who?

726
01:00:53.839 --> 01:00:54.799
Mr. Tohir.

727
01:00:54.879 --> 01:00:56.240
-Tohir?
-Yes.

728
01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:59.000
I'm Toha, not Tohir. Stupid!

729
01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.879
Don't be noisy!

730
01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.000
-Go away!
-Sorry, we have the wrong person.

731
01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.240
-Excuse me, sir.
-Go now!

732
01:01:06.319 --> 01:01:09.799
Can't you be polite?
He already apologized!

733
01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:11.799
You want to fight?

734
01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.279
-Fight me!
-Don't you know I'm a champion?

735
01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:17.279
Come on!

736
01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.080
-Wrong target.
-Are you okay?

737
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.960
Let me finish him.

738
01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:26.919
Go straight to Kerinci

739
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.359
Let me show you my mastery!

740
01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.600
Go to Ciateul to buy dodol

741
01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.759
One strike from me, you'll lose control!

742
01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:38.600
Here, kiss my armpits.

743
01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.799
-Does it smell?
-Hey, help me!

744
01:01:40.879 --> 01:01:41.759
Back off!

745
01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:43.839
Honey.

746
01:01:46.319 --> 01:01:47.160
Darling!

747
01:01:48.919 --> 01:01:50.000
You want more?

748
01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.160
Okay, let's do it.

749
01:01:53.319 --> 01:01:54.359
You guys are noisy!

750
01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.600
The door can't be closed.
Do you want to take a peek?

751
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.480
It's stuck.

752
01:02:08.359 --> 01:02:10.600
The city people are crazy.

753
01:02:12.399 --> 01:02:13.480
Is that his wife?

754
01:02:28.279 --> 01:02:34.720
May the peace, mercy,
and blessings of Allah be upon you.

755
01:02:34.799 --> 01:02:39.279
May peace, mercy,
and blessings of Allah be upon you too.

756
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.399
Mr. Rhoma!

757
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.560
Mr. Rhoma!

758
01:02:47.879 --> 01:02:50.080
-Peace be upon you, Mr. Rhoma!
-Uli!

759
01:02:52.279 --> 01:02:54.720
-Sit down!
-Mr. Rhoma!

760
01:03:09.399 --> 01:03:10.279
Are you ready?

761
01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.919
I hope my outfit isn't too much.

762
01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:18.919
It's very Indian.

763
01:03:22.759 --> 01:03:24.279
Let's have fun.

764
01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.799
Let's go.

765
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.160
Are we not inviting Emir along?

766
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.160
No need. He's asleep.

767
01:05:33.759 --> 01:05:34.680
Are you good?

768
01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.560
I am.

769
01:05:45.759 --> 01:05:46.600
Emir!

770
01:05:47.879 --> 01:05:49.040
Sanjay!

771
01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.799
Emir! Let go of me!

772
01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.759
Emir, let go of me!

773
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.520
Emir, what did you do to Sanjay?

774
01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.560
He has been very kind to us!

775
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.799
Emir, let me go!

776
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.799
You're being indecent!

777
01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.520
Let's go home!

778
01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.759
No! I want to be with Sanjay!

779
01:08:14.279 --> 01:08:15.120
Do you want this?

780
01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.319
Now that we have done it,

781
01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:25.720
what's next?

782
01:08:28.679 --> 01:08:29.679
What's the time now?

783
01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.960
Sanjay!

784
01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:36.200
Maybe it's noon.

785
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.359
We have to go, Devi.

786
01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:41.679
The producers are waiting.

787
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:45.960
You need to get ready.

788
01:08:46.519 --> 01:08:49.800
Today, we'll meet
Amitabh Bachan's producer.

789
01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.720
What clothes should I wear?

790
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.760
As long as it's beautiful.

791
01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.760
Not now, Devi.

792
01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:11.200
Emir?

793
01:09:12.599 --> 01:09:14.200
Yes, I am.

794
01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.319
I'm not decent right now.

795
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.840
You've been indecent since last night!

796
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.720
I love Sanjay.

797
01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.599
I want to talk to Devi!

798
01:09:50.559 --> 01:09:51.720
You should be aware.

799
01:09:52.559 --> 01:09:53.760
After yesterday's incident,

800
01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.360
it's a good thing he didn't kick you out.

801
01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.000
Devi, what should I do?

802
01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.880
I want to have fun!

803
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.120
You are crazy!

804
01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.760
You've been crazy since childhood.

805
01:10:11.599 --> 01:10:14.120
And I don't mean anything to you anymore.

806
01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.760
You always belittle me.

807
01:10:17.679 --> 01:10:19.400
I should have gone to India alone.

808
01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.519
That's how it should have been.

809
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.080
I am stupid!

810
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.679
I am just deceiving myself!

811
01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.280
Sanjay is a bad person.

812
01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.760
Since we were kids,

813
01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.720
-I've always tried--
-And you think I'm ungrateful?

814
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.240
Listen!

815
01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:49.080
It never occurred to you
that everything you've done so far

816
01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.679
has never moved me!

817
01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.760
But I remained silent.

818
01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.880
Because if I refuse, you will get hurt.

819
01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.679
Who am I?

820
01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.639
I'm just an orphan
who hopes for your family's pity.

821
01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.120
-Enough, Devi!
-No!

822
01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:05.960
You always force your way!
That's the problem!

823
01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:10.200
Do you realize that
I am closer to Uli than to you?

824
01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.679
No.

825
01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:16.120
Every time I show signs or even say it,

826
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.480
you always deny it.

827
01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.240
I saw Amitabh Bachan yesterday.

828
01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.639
If only you were there…

829
01:11:55.519 --> 01:11:56.840
Forgive me, Emir.

830
01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.559
Emir?

831
01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.679
FROM BROTHER EMIR

832
01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.400
Emir is gone.

833
01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:08.360
-I have to catch up with him.
-No need, Devi.

834
01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.040
He'll definitely be back.

835
01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.720
He couldn't possibly leave you here alone.

836
01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.240
-But…
-No need.

837
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.440
I will help you find him later.

838
01:13:22.519 --> 01:13:23.360
Come.

839
01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.080
Good morning!

840
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.240
So rude.

841
01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.320
Brother.

842
01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.080
Wait!

843
01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.000
It's him.

844
01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.080
Brother?

845
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.240
Brother.

846
01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.360
-Brother.
-Brother!

847
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.440
Brother!

848
01:14:01.519 --> 01:14:03.559
-What is it?
-It's him.

849
01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:05.679
Yes, who is he?

850
01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.599
It's him!

851
01:14:07.679 --> 01:14:09.719
Yes, who is he?

852
01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.800
It's him!

853
01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.480
Devi's dad!

854
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.639
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

855
01:14:21.559 --> 01:14:22.679
So, how is that?

856
01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.120
It's impossible.

857
01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.760
I've been looking for you for a long time.

858
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.320
It's only been two days.

859
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:30.240
While I was back in the village,
I was busy looking for you.

860
01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.480
I asked everywhere.

861
01:14:32.559 --> 01:14:34.280
You just disappeared.

862
01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.360
Now Devi is an adult.

863
01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.080
She's in India now.

864
01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.880
-India?
-Yes.

865
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:40.800
Brother.

866
01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.160
-So, this is Devi's dad?
-Yes!

867
01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.639
-It's because…
-Her mom.

868
01:14:46.719 --> 01:14:47.840
Right.

869
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.639
Farida is still crazy too.

870
01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:51.920
Up until she died.

871
01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.240
-When?
-A long time ago.

872
01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.080
Devi was still in elementary school
at that time.

873
01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.160
How is Devi?

874
01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.120
She is busy looking for her dad!

875
01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.960
Please, eat.

876
01:15:24.639 --> 01:15:25.639
I'm not hungry.

877
01:15:33.639 --> 01:15:34.480
Sanjay.

878
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:42.880
What about us?

879
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.360
-Us?
-Yes, us.

880
01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.040
That's us.

881
01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.920
Why did you let me be
with another man last night?

882
01:16:14.519 --> 01:16:15.679
In this country,

883
01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.360
you have to do many things to survive.

884
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.040
You mean I have to be a woman
who switches partners?

885
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.880
You have to be able to differentiate

886
01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.320
which one is love and which one is sex.

887
01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.960
Sanjay loves Devi.

888
01:16:34.639 --> 01:16:37.280
Everything else is just sex.

889
01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:42.880
Eat.

890
01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.480
Yes, of course she's beautiful.

891
01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.320
Yes, wait.

892
01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.679
You wait for me downstairs. Okay?

893
01:17:13.519 --> 01:17:14.800
Yes, bro.

894
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.840
Sanjay!

895
01:17:38.639 --> 01:17:40.040
Hey, Sunil. Come.

896
01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:47.599
Devi, this is my best friend, Sunil.

897
01:17:47.679 --> 01:17:48.920
-Sunil.
-Devi.

898
01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.480
Accompany him, okay?

899
01:18:24.559 --> 01:18:26.360
You bastard, Sanjay!

900
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:52.840
Come here.

901
01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.840
I don't want to live like this anymore!

902
01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.360
So you just want to have fun here?

903
01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.120
I didn't come here to be like this.

904
01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.840
But I am looking for my dad.

905
01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.760
Listen.

906
01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:10.800
You should realize that

907
01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.360
Amitabh Bachan couldn't possibly
have a daughter like you!

908
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.200
You bastard!

909
01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.559
You have to go home.

910
01:19:57.639 --> 01:20:00.719
There's nothing left for me there.

911
01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.639
Devi!

912
01:20:03.599 --> 01:20:06.760
-Devi doesn't like me.
-No!

913
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Devi needs her dad!

914
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.480
Amitabh Bachan maybe.

915
01:20:11.559 --> 01:20:13.280
But me? Who am I?

916
01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.400
You're Devi's dad!

917
01:20:40.559 --> 01:20:43.440
Devi, I have to go.

918
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.280
I can't bear to see
how much you've changed.

919
01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.760
It's too drastic. This isn't the real you.

920
01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.440
I'm confused.

921
01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.760
I don't know what else to do
but leave you.

922
01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.960
If I've been your burden

923
01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:10.000
for 20 years,

924
01:21:10.679 --> 01:21:12.160
I should know my place and leave.

925
01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.360
My heart is asking to heal.

926
01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.440
If my sacrifice meant nothing,

927
01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.920
why should I stay
when you still feel helpless?

928
01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.240
Your existence makes me sad, Devi.

929
01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.480
It breaks my heart.

930
01:21:38.639 --> 01:21:40.480
THE JOURNEY OF THE LEGENDS

931
01:21:40.559 --> 01:21:41.679
You know…

932
01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.639
Mumbai is close to Tibet.

933
01:21:45.679 --> 01:21:47.080
Dalai Lama's city.

934
01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.200
Your mom

935
01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.360
left this letter for you.

936
01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.559
Keep it safe, okay?

937
01:22:38.559 --> 01:22:40.160
My dear Amitabh.

938
01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.679
My daughter, Devi,

939
01:22:43.519 --> 01:22:45.920
believes that you are her dad.

940
01:22:46.599 --> 01:22:49.360
She loves dancing just like you.

941
01:22:50.719 --> 01:22:52.679
She wants to make you proud.

942
01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:58.200
Even though there's already someone
who admires her and is very proud of her.

943
01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.800
If you want to know,

944
01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.360
his name is Emir.

945
01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:08.480
Emir obeyed all of Devi's wishes

946
01:23:08.559 --> 01:23:11.480
to the point that
they saved a lot of money

947
01:23:11.559 --> 01:23:13.800
to meet you in India.

948
01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.880
By the way, are you okay?

949
01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.000
The last time I saw you was at the cinema.

950
01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:27.519
It felt like the way you looked into
the lens was meant for me.

951
01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:30.200
It pierced straight
to the depths of my heart.

952
01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.679
I think my baby bump appeared
while I was at the cinema.

953
01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.920
Not in bed with my real husband.

954
01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.240
Poor Devi's dad.

955
01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:45.440
He left because he felt
you were his rival.

956
01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:49.040
But there's no harm in him
keeping my dreams alive.

957
01:23:49.639 --> 01:23:51.360
It was just a dream.

958
01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.080
It could never be real.

959
01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.880
There you are, in your sparkling world.

960
01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.480
And I'm here, in Kerinci,

961
01:24:02.559 --> 01:24:07.160
a place that only shines
when the stars appear at night.

962
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:09.960
I am sorry.

963
01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:13.200
I can't come to meet you.

964
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.400
I'm unwell.

965
01:24:16.519 --> 01:24:19.040
Traveling long distances is impossible.

966
01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.480
But I send our daughter,

967
01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:27.840
Devi, who brought this letter to you.

968
01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.800
And I introduce Emir to you,

969
01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.679
the young man who has always been
her protective knight.

970
01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.240
Farida, Kerinci.

971
01:24:48.599 --> 01:24:50.160
Emir! Stop!

972
01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.240
Emir! Please, stop!

973
01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.120
Emir.

974
01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.920
Emir.

975
01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.080
Emir.

976
01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.200
Wake up, Emir.

977
01:25:11.679 --> 01:25:13.880
Emir, wake up.

978
01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.200
Emir, wake up.

979
01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:19.280
Emir, wake up.

980
01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:20.840
Devi.

981
01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.559
Yes, I am here.

982
01:25:24.559 --> 01:25:26.160
I love you.

983
01:25:29.559 --> 01:25:30.760
I am here.

984
01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.519
You're safe now.

985
01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.679
Are you getting better?

986
01:26:14.639 --> 01:26:15.599
Why do you care?

987
01:26:19.559 --> 01:26:20.960
I love Devi.

988
01:26:23.719 --> 01:26:24.920
I love Devi.

989
01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.880
But Devi loves me.

990
01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.320
Uli.

991
01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.400
Since childhood,

992
01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.880
I gave you many chances to act,

993
01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.719
but you never did.

994
01:26:42.559 --> 01:26:45.240
Not once did you

995
01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.360
look into my eyes

996
01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.920
to confess your love for Devi.

997
01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.120
Never.

998
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.160
Do you know why?

999
01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.080
Because you've always forbidden me
even since we were kids.

1000
01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.320
Do you think that's how you respect me?

1001
01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.240
Yes.

1002
01:27:12.559 --> 01:27:13.559
No.

1003
01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.400
That's it.

1004
01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:22.000
That's all I can do
to make you understand!

1005
01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.599
-I do understand!
-If you did,

1006
01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.840
you should have advised me
a long time ago!

1007
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.639
Why would I care about a kid?

1008
01:27:30.719 --> 01:27:33.320
You never listen to me!

1009
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.280
You've always kept me

1010
01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.120
away from Devi, ever since long ago.

1011
01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.719
-But you guys were secretly dating!
-We love each other!

1012
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.639
How can I believe that

1013
01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:50.000
when I've never heard Devi say it?

1014
01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.719
-As for Devi…
-You can ask Devi!

1015
01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:04.200
You two are like children
who don't know the rules!

1016
01:28:04.759 --> 01:28:05.960
You're both selfish.

1017
01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:11.599
I don't know what's going on in your head.

1018
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.160
Where is your conscience?

1019
01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.519
You're fighting over me
like I'm some kind of toy!

1020
01:28:18.599 --> 01:28:21.360
-It's all because of you!
-This is our destiny, Emir!

1021
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.280
Destiny?

1022
01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.639
Uli should have been more firm!

1023
01:28:25.719 --> 01:28:28.160
Uli should stop making me angry!

1024
01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.719
Uli should have followed his idol
the wrong way! I'm better.

1025
01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:35.840
I've worked hard to achieve what I want!

1026
01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:39.240
I'd lie in Kathmandu
for my love for you, Devi!

1027
01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:41.639
I went to Jakarta looking for Devi's dad!

1028
01:28:41.719 --> 01:28:44.759
-If you knew what was happening in India--
-Enough, Emir!

1029
01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:17.639
If your mom were here now…

1030
01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:19.160
She'll be happy, Dad.

1031
01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.080
I know.

1032
01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.679
Your life must have been happy back then.

1033
01:29:25.679 --> 01:29:28.240
Mom always tried and I loved that.

1034
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.360
I shouldn't have left.

1035
01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.719
Yes.

1036
01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:39.920
I am sorry

1037
01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.920
for leaving you

1038
01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:46.200
and your mom.

1039
01:29:47.639 --> 01:29:50.519
My competition was Amitabh Bachan.

1040
01:29:51.759 --> 01:29:54.320
That doesn't mean you should have left.

1041
01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.120
I understand that now.

1042
01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:59.759
But the dream was beautiful.

1043
01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:03.960
That dream made Mom happy.

1044
01:30:04.599 --> 01:30:07.200
It made her feel romantic.

1045
01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:11.120
It made her love me.

1046
01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.679
She wanted to take care of me,
to dress me.

1047
01:30:15.759 --> 01:30:17.559
She noticed everything!

1048
01:30:17.639 --> 01:30:19.679
From head to toe!

1049
01:30:21.559 --> 01:30:24.040
If only you had truly understood
back then.

1050
01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.240
Yes…

1051
01:30:30.639 --> 01:30:31.559
Yes.

1052
01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.080
I don't understand

1053
01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.400
how to show

1054
01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.160
my love to your mom.

1055
01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.400
I don't belong here right now.

1056
01:31:02.679 --> 01:31:03.880
You belong here.
