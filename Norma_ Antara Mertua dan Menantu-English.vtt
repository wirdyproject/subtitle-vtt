A TRUE STORY BY NORMA RISMA

2
00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:30.666
[Norma] Marriage
is supposed to be once-in-a-lifetime.

3
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.583
Unfortunately,

4
00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:36.875
not all mistakes

5
00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:39.625
or betrayals

6
00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:40.541
[camera click]

7
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.875
[crying]
can be forgiven by the word "Sorry".

8
00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:50.791
[pensive music]

9
00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:54.000
Like what happened in my marriage.

10
00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:01.958
The betrayal,

11
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.166
[quiet sob]

12
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.250
it was my husband who did it.

13
00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:11.125
With someone I should have respected…

14
00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:13.791
PRESIDING JUDGE

15
00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:17.666
…and the one who should love me the most.

16
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.958
[dramatic music builds]

17
00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:25.333
[sobbing]

[light background music]

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.625
A FEW MONTHS EARLIER

20
00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:44.625
[Ummi] Our topic this morning is…

21
00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:47.833
"The Role of Mothers in Islam"

22
00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:49.541
Kindly have your notes ready.

23
00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:51.375
Let's learn together later, shall we?

24
00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:56.791
You're just walking around aimlessly!

25
00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:58.583
They haven't arrived yet, Mom!

26
00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:04.416
Norma has set aside one for you, Mom.

27
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.375
[Ummi] Everyone ready?

28
00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:08.500
As the saying goes…

29
00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:13.625
Heaven lies under the feet

30
00:02:13.708 --> 00:02:14.833
of mothers.

31
00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:18.208
Mother is the first school,

32
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:20.875
and also primary for her children.

33
00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.708
[Ummi] So if a mother succeeds…

34
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:26.583
…to raise her children to be good humans,

35
00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:29.416
the society will also
become a strong society.

36
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.458
Mom, can I go out for a while?

37
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:35.708
[Ummi] Because a mother's love
is always easy.

38
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:37.083
Where is Anton?

39
00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:38.708
He's sick, Boss!

40
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.000
Nauseous!

41
00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:41.625
Have you told him to
seek medical treatment?

42
00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:44.500
Yes, Boss, he has been absent
for a few days now.

43
00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:47.916
-Maybe he’s been cursed, Sir.
-Hey, watch your mouth!

BANTEN GRAND MOSQUE'S ISLAMIC STUDY

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.333
[Boss] Stop!

46
00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:57.041
[light background music]

47
00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:59.125
That's why you should learn to drive!

48
00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:02.083
If Anton is absent like this,
you don't have to wait for me.

49
00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:03.666
[van driver] That woman has arrived, Boss!

50
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.416
My apologies, I was delayed
due to an unforeseen issue.

51
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.208
Fine Sir, the main thing is
you've arrived safely.

52
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.125
Is everything ready?

53
00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:13.916
All done, but there's still one more left.

54
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.833
-Okay.
-This is so heavy.

55
00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:17.833
Miss, I'm sorry for making
you wait so long.

56
00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:19.375
It’s okay!

57
00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:24.708
These are for mothers and kids
of our religious study group.

58
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:28.666
-[teacher calling] Calm down!
-[children shouting]

59
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.083
-Well, you know.
-Easy… Easy…!

60
00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:34.083
-Kids, take it easy!
-[children clamouring]

61
00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:35.041
Children…

62
00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:37.250
[Norma] You're welcome!

63
00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:41.041
-When you have one, go study again!
-[children] Thank you, Miss!

64
00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:42.583
-What is that?
-Me!

65
00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:44.000
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

66
00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:46.416
Yeah. Share them, okay? Here.

67
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.125
Is everything done, Miss?

68
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.916
Yes, it’s done.

69
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.166
-Thank you, Sir.
-My pleasure!

70
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.625
And thank you to the driver as well!

71
00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:57.333
Oh right, let me introduce
my boss, Mr. Irfan.

72
00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:00.833
If it weren't for him,
I could go back and forth by motorcycle.

73
00:04:00.916 --> 00:04:02.958
[driver] It took an hour!

74
00:04:03.583 --> 00:04:04.541
[Irfan] Irfan!

[umm sound]

77
00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:14.333
Hey, I think we've met before, right?

78
00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:16.250
You seem familiar.

79
00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:17.875
He's hitting on you!

80
00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.291
Ah, i’m being serious! Where did we meet?

81
00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:22.791
What did you say your name was?

82
00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:26.833
[embarrassed cough] Sorry,
I haven't said my name yet.

83
00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:28.208
I’m Norma, Sir.

84
00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:29.916
Norma from SMANDA?

85
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.291
Are you from SMANDA too?

86
00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.583
[shows ID card]

87
00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:37.250
I'm Irfan Wardana, Social Three!

88

-You’re head of pencak silat, right?
-[chuckle] I'm the vice-chairman.

-Oh!
-[giggles]

90
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.125
[Norma] This shows…

91
00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:48.041
…how important a mother's
role is in Islam.

92
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.333
Miss, we're sorry,
we have to take our leave now.

93
00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:53.875
Can I have your phone?

94
00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.541
[startled breath] No way, the boss
is asking for a phone?

95
00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:58.875
Just buy one!

96
00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.750
Your phone number, I mean. May I have it?

97

[shy umm sound]

98
00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:07.000
No, thank you, Sir. I have to go now.

00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:07.916
Peace be upon you.

100

-Peace be upon you.
-Miss, sorry, you forgot this.

101
00:05:10.708 --> 00:05:14.000
Oh, the staff here will
take care of it later.

102
00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:15.666
-His name is Mr. Unim.
-Okay.

-Sir, the pedicab, please.
-[driver] Yes, Ma'am.

108
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:50.875
[Norma] Mom, do you know Rika,
my old college friend?

109
00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.583
She now works at SD Tunas Bangsa.

110
00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:55.583
[Mom grunts]

111
00:05:55.666 --> 00:05:58.208
She asked me to work there, Mom…

112
00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:02.583
…to replace a religious teacher there.

113
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:07.708
Their teacher just resigned
after marital leave.

114
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:11.458
What do you think if I move there?

115
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:13.083
The salary is quite good.

116
00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:16.708
You barely help me at the stall
while working at the TPA,

117
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.166
why do you think you can be a teacher?

118
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.208
Well, I'm pretty sure, Mom.
I will arrange the time later.

119
00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:25.583
It would be a pity to miss it.

120
00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:27.708
May I?

121
00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:33.416
[Norma] Who's here, Mom?

122
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:36.125
-[Norma] Peace be upon you.
-[Mom] Peace be upon you.

-My dear!
-Why didn’t you tell me before?

128
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:08.125
-Surprise!
-[happy laugh]

129
00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:10.250
If I had known,
I would’ve bought you Bang Cukit's Apem!

130
00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:11.375
[Norma] Let’s see ya!

131
00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:13.958
[Norma chuckling]
Koh Akin gave you a day off?

132
00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:16.791
[Dad] Koh Akin's sibling
is having a wedding.

133
00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:20.375
He is busy with the wedding,
so the shop is closed now!

134
00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:21.333
[Norma laughs]

135
00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:23.541
[Norma] Alright,
I'll take the food to the kitchen.

136
00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:25.625
[Dad] It's okay, I'll take care of it!

137
00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:31.291
I'll be in the back room!

138

[deep breath]

139
00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:44.208
How’s your mother?

140
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.125
Well, the same…

141
00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:50.041
-The same?
-Yes.

143
00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:55.458
She still sells chicken noodles
when there are orders.

144
00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:59.375
She tends to keep to herself while free.

145
00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:01.333
[Norma] As if
you don’t know her at all.

146
00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:03.875
Well, I was just asking how she is.

147
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.958
[Norma] Mom!

[door opens]

149
00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:16.666
Mom, come to the town square
with me and Dad!

150
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.083
Come and buy Bang Cukit’s Apem.

151
00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:19.208
You go!

152
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:22.875
[Norma] Come on, Mom!
We rarely go out together.

153
00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.041
Only this once, please!

154
00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:25.208
You should go!

155
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:27.250
-My dear!
-Yes, Dad?

156
00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:29.875
[Dad] It's okay, let's just go together!

157
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958
Alright then, I'm going now.

158
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.000
-[Norma] Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you.

-Thank you very much.
-Sure.

163

Dad, why don't you want
to move your job here?

Keep me company, I'm getting lonely.

Well, Dad's livelihood is in Jakarta.

What job would I do if I worked here?

The salary here isn't much either.

171
00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.000
It's because you want
to be far from Mom, right?

Once you have a partner, you'll forget me.

You will not be lonely anymore!

No, Dad!

175
00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:40.708
Even if I have a partner,
I'll still be ‘clingy’ to Dad!

What is ‘clingy’?

178
00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:48.583
Clingy' means very close!

179

about getting a partner yet, Dad…

Mom…

323
00:17:38.708 --> 00:17:41.583
Mom, I have something to give you…

324
00:17:41.666 --> 00:17:44.083
This is from Irfan.

325
00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:46.208
Please accept!

326
00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:11.291
-[Irfan] Auntie!
-Yes?

-Please sit.
-Gosh.

330
00:18:23.166 --> 00:18:25.375
Oh, no. [deep sigh]

331
00:18:25.458 --> 00:18:26.291
Mom…

332
00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:28.000
Yes, Irfan?

333
00:18:28.083 --> 00:18:30.125
[footsteps]

334
00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:33.208
Firza, do you know where
your sister’s birth certificate is?

335
00:18:33.291 --> 00:18:34.375
[Firza] No!

336
00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:36.708
-[footsteps] Mom!
-You're always gaming!

337
00:18:36.791 --> 00:18:39.708
-Peace be upon you, Madam.
-[Irfan's mom] Peace be upon you.

338
00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:41.625
Are you waiting for…

339
00:18:41.708 --> 00:18:42.875
[breath of assent]

340
00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:44.083
Irfan, Madam.

341
00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:46.625
You’re a friend of Irfan?

342
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:48.416
-[Irfan] Future wife!
-What?

343
00:18:49.083 --> 00:18:52.166
Future wife? Seriously?

344
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.416
Well, praise to God…

345
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.875
…somebody is interested in you.

346
00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.833
[Mom] No, I’m kidding, dear!

347
00:18:58.916 --> 00:19:01.041
Sorry, what’s your name?

348
00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:04.541
-[call ringing]
-Peace be upon you, Mira. What’s up?

349
00:19:04.625 --> 00:19:07.416
Please wait a moment,
Irfan has a guest here.

350
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.458
[embarrassed chuckle] Sorry, dear!

351
00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:14.375
This is Mira, Irfan's sister.
She's looking for her birth certificate.

352
00:19:14.458 --> 00:19:17.958
Where is it? [mumbling] I forgot it.

353
00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:20.250
Firza, did you eat already?

354
00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:23.333
I bought you a batagor, don't forget it.

355
00:19:23.416 --> 00:19:24.458
-[Irfan] Mom…
-Well, where is it?

356
00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:26.500
-Mom…
-Ouch, it’s so heavy!

357
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:29.166
-Mom…
-What now, Irfan?

358
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.875
Go see her, first.

359
00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.791
Wait, this is your sister's thing.

360
00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:35.041
Peace be upon you. Mira? Mira?

361
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.625
[Irfan] I'm so sorry about that!

362
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.125
Parents have different ways
of showing their love, Honey.

363
00:19:51.208 --> 00:19:53.666
That's what my dad said.

364
00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.958
[Irfan] But, your mother loves you.

365
00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:04.500
That's why he wants to
make sure I'm fighting for you.

366
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.625
-Peace be upon you, Madam.
-Peace be upon you.

367
00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:13.583
If I may, I have something
I would like to say…

368
00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:18.083
I beg you, Madam.

369
00:20:23.583 --> 00:20:26.791
I'm serious about Norma, I love her.

370
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:29.083
I promise you,
I'll bring happiness to Norma,

371
00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:32.291
take care of her, and never hurt her.

372
00:20:36.166 --> 00:20:38.125
Who allowed you to come inside?

373
00:20:41.208 --> 00:20:42.375
Norma, Madam.

374
00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:45.208
-If that's the case, get out now.
-Mom!

375
00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:47.458
This is my house.

376
00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:49.833
[Norma] Mom!

377
00:20:53.125 --> 00:20:54.875
I don’t wanna talk about it.

378
00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:57.083
Who do you wanna choose, me or him?

379
00:20:57.166 --> 00:21:00.083
Why do I have to choose, Mom?

380
00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:04.208
I love you!

381
00:21:05.916 --> 00:21:08.375
But I also want to be serious with him.

382
00:21:09.125 --> 00:21:10.041
I don’t like him!

383
00:21:12.458 --> 00:21:16.000
Do you dislike him, or do you dislike
that I'm serious about him?

384
00:21:16.083 --> 00:21:18.458
[Mom] Remember what
Ummi taught us yesterday?

385
00:21:18.541 --> 00:21:20.541
"Mother, mother, mother" [huffing]

386
00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:23.250
If your mother says no, it means no!

387
00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:27.916
But she also told me,

388
00:21:29.166 --> 00:21:32.541
when the Prophet forbids something,
there must be a reason…

389
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.166
…I don't understand yours.

390
00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:40.708
You don’t need to!

391
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.958
[Irfan] So, you want to break up?

392
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:50.125
[Norma] I don't want to be a bad daughter.

393
00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:54.833
Do you still want to fight for us?

394
00:21:57.833 --> 00:22:00.166
Shall we go to Jakarta to see your dad?

395
00:22:00.916 --> 00:22:02.875
It's your dad who will be
our marriage guardian.

396
00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:08.250
[train horn blaring]

397
00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:09.500
Peace be upon you.

398
00:22:09.583 --> 00:22:10.583
[Norma] Dad…

399
00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:13.250
[Dad] Peace be upon you.

400
00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:16.291
When I was at the square…

401
00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:21.208
I was worried that you just
wanna have fun with her.

402
00:22:21.291 --> 00:22:25.083
But you intend to bring Norma here.

403
00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:28.083
I believe you’re serious about her.

404
00:22:28.166 --> 00:22:31.833
Also, I’m quite sure…

405
00:22:31.916 --> 00:22:35.250
…many of her male friends
couldn't stand her mother.

406
00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:37.625
I am truly in love with Norma, Sir.

407
00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:45.958
I love Irfan too, Dad.

408
00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:48.500
If God wills, I want us to be serious.

409
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.583
Yeah, it’s a relief for me,
if you have the same feeling.

410
00:22:54.666 --> 00:22:57.750
If you want to get married soon…

411
00:22:57.833 --> 00:23:00.000
…then go ahead.

412
00:23:00.083 --> 00:23:04.166
You two take care of the wedding,
I'll take care of Mom.

413
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:08.750
[happy music]

414
00:23:11.375 --> 00:23:13.208
Thank God!

415
00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:14.708
You've already agreed?

416
00:23:15.708 --> 00:23:17.375
You want to go against me?

417
00:23:17.458 --> 00:23:21.375
[Dad] Look, I don't want to fight, okay!

418
00:23:21.458 --> 00:23:22.833
Please stop!

419
00:23:23.416 --> 00:23:25.916
Norma is a grown-up now.

420
00:23:26.708 --> 00:23:30.208
If they are meant to be,
it is not good to obstruct them.

421
00:23:30.291 --> 00:23:32.708
How do you know they're meant to be?

422
00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:34.041
[deep breath]

423
00:23:34.125 --> 00:23:38.458
-Will this kind of thing last a lifetime?
-Well, who knows if it can.

424
00:23:39.208 --> 00:23:41.875
But if they love each other,
why should we stop them?

425
00:23:41.958 --> 00:23:43.791
Why don’t we support them?

426
00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:47.916
We can have a good marriage
even without love.

427
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.541
[Dad] What’s ‘good’ here, you think?

428
00:23:49.625 --> 00:23:52.500
You say a marriage like this is fine.

429
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.791
You're objecting
because you care about her?

430
00:23:57.458 --> 00:24:00.541
Or because you don’t
want to see her happy?

431
00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:07.000
Happy? What does she know about 'happy'?

432
00:24:09.666 --> 00:24:11.875
She knows better than you.

I am not agreeing to this! [choking sound]

[Dad] Okay, fine!

436
00:24:21.041 --> 00:24:24.875
I will marry them off,

437
00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:28.666
with or without your consent!

I marry you to my daughter…

and ten grams of gold paid in cash.

444
00:25:07.708 --> 00:25:11.250
I accept the marriage to
Norma Risma, daughter of Abdul Mahmud.

445

With the aforementioned
dowry paid in cash.

good in this world, and in the Hereafter,

and protect us from the torment of Fire.

I wonder why.
The salary is pretty good, right?

will help her sell chicken noodles.

from my Umrah savings.

Fine, I'll take you there.
I'm almost done.

Honey, you can go inside first.

Mom, can I go home now?

644

I have to prepare for my meeting tomorrow.

Yeah, it's fine.

I'll come back to pick you up later.

653

Oh, no need.
I'll go home with Auntie later.

after selling chicken noodles all day.

657
00:40:04.666 --> 00:40:08.750
No, it's definitely just
the scallion smell!

658
00:40:08.833 --> 00:40:12.625
It's really smells good, Auntie.
Are you sure it's scallions?

are you okay, Mom?

Sorry, Mom, I didn't see the hole!

It's okay, Mom. You've been working
all morning, you must be tired!

00:42:29.208 --> 00:42:31.750
Oh, you're wearing my lipstick, Mom?

You look great, beautiful and glowing!

Thanks, Boss!

681
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.583
-Thank you, Boss.
-Sit somewhere else.

682
00:43:04.666 --> 00:43:07.791
You just sit there,
so Irfan can be next to me!

next to each other, right?

him! He's a married man, have some shame!

688
00:43:32.208 --> 00:43:36.125
Just let me, Fajri.
He's still willing to be flirted with!

689
00:43:36.208 --> 00:43:37.916
He just pretends to be aloof!

690

Right? When there were just the two of us?

Anyway, Etni flirts with everyone,
not just me!

Really? [tsk tsk] It's a sin to lie!

I swear there's
nothing between me and her.

Is that so?

729
00:46:58.208 --> 00:47:02.583
Mom, I truly want to show you
that I'm a good son

and not the type to cause trouble.

Can you explain this to me?

786
00:50:59.416 --> 00:51:02.791
See? I didn't reply to anything.
That's just how she is.

-She doesn't just send it to me.
-But you already have a wife!

we not talk about that? I'm tired.

-[loudly] I'm tired!

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.458
You should have asked me why I'm late!

Seriously? This is the question I get?

795
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.500
I'm telling you, this is important to me.

796
00:51:35.583 --> 00:51:39.333
I wouldn't be like this
if you had told me everything.

797

I’m not lying!

798
00:51:40.833 --> 00:51:42.833
But you didn't tell me
that Etni is your ex.

799
00:51:42.916 --> 00:51:47.583
You hired Etni. I can't deal
with this kind of secrecy.

Who told you this? Fajri?

No, it will only get worse later.

[Norma] What's wrong?

967
01:07:35.541 --> 01:07:37.125
[Irfan] Nothing!

968
01:07:37.208 --> 01:07:39.041
-Let's grab lunch first, okay?
-Let's go.

01:09:18.291 --> 01:09:19.416
Nothing, Honey.

01:09:47.625 --> 01:09:48.458
[Norma] Honey?

[confused umm]

980
01:09:54.208 --> 01:09:57.791
Let's go to sleep, Honey.
I think I'm not well.

-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you.

982

Peace be upon you. Wow, perfect timing…

983
01:10:13.166 --> 01:10:15.291
I'd like to take my leave.

984
01:10:16.583 --> 01:10:20.458
Dad, you better go to Jakarta tomorrow,
or you'll arrive late.

985
01:10:20.541 --> 01:10:24.916
It's fine, because we have
many things coming tomorrow.

986
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.125
Koh Akin tends to get confused
when Dad isn't around.

987

Let me take you, Dad?

988
01:10:29.666 --> 01:10:32.000
No need, I've already
booked a travel agency.

[soft dramatic music]

-That looks like the travel agency.
-Oh yes, it is!

993
01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:05.291
-I'll go get my bag first.
-I'll get it for you, Dad.

994
01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:06.791
Okay.

995
01:11:09.958 --> 01:11:13.833
-How was the trip?
-[chuckle] It was good.

996
01:11:26.333 --> 01:11:27.333
Mom…

997
01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:33.208
Next time you go on vacation,
please take me along, okay?

998
01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:35.750
[giggle] Please stop it, Dad!

999
01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:37.916
Honey, they're already waiting.

1000
01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:40.500
Yes, Honey.

1001
01:11:42.583 --> 01:11:45.833
It turns out the travel vehicle is small.

1002
01:11:46.416 --> 01:11:47.291
Dad.

1003
01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:49.250
Alright, thank you Irfan.

[short sigh]

1005
01:11:55.250 --> 01:12:01.041
I give all my care to Norma,
she's my only beloved girl.

[murmer of assent]

I promise you, Dad.

1008
01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:11.500
Aren't you going to
say goodbye to Mom first?

1009
01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:14.333
Please tell Mom that I've taken my leave.

1010
01:12:21.708 --> 01:12:25.125
I thought the travel van was big enough.

1011
01:12:26.333 --> 01:12:29.666
-[van driver] Will it fit?
-[Dad] Of course, I'm slim.

1012
01:12:30.166 --> 01:12:35.166
Well, tell the ceiling repairman
where it needs to be fixed!

1013
01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:37.375
Why couldn’t you fix a
piece of cake like this?

[frustrated moan]

Rina?

1016
01:12:41.291 --> 01:12:43.916
I'd like to go home now,
I need to wait for the ceiling repairman.

1017
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.958
Yahya is unreliable!

1018
01:12:46.583 --> 01:12:50.708
[deep sigh] He tends
to follow people, like a spy…

1019
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:53.666
-But he can't even wait for a repairman.
-[customer] Are they done, Ma'am?

1020
01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:56.500
-Thank you. You're welcome.
-It's the right amount.

My friends miss your chicken noodles.

1025
01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:39.208
I also miss it.

Is it just me who's feeling this?

Because of Yahya, I left my wallet behind.

I think it's time we had a baby.

1140
01:23:43.666 --> 01:23:45.375
Can we skip it for tonight?

1141

I have to leave very early tomorrow.

It was oily before and Auntie ask me
to clean it.

Did I ask you like that, huh?

1199

Look, there's a woman's voice
inside Irfan's room.

Why do you always come home at lunchtime?

1224
01:28:40.458 --> 01:28:43.916
With a one-hour break,
am I not allowed to rest at home?

you're hiding something…

It's kind of unclear though.

Let’s go!

1230

[Auntie] Watch out,
I'm definitely going to find her.

1231

If we find her, I won't forgive you.
Let's go!

Let's search out front.

1233
01:29:01.166 --> 01:29:02.541
[Yahya] Can I check up in the bathroom?

1234
01:29:02.625 --> 01:29:04.625
[Auntie] Find her!

1235
01:29:04.708 --> 01:29:06.958
Where is she?

1236
01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:09.458
[Yahya] I've looked
everywhere and found nothing.

1237
01:29:09.541 --> 01:29:11.416
Then where is she?

1238
01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:16.000
How about we go back in and apologize now.

1239

Hey, why are you dragging me!

1240

Sorry for causing trouble.

1241

She wants to apologize
because we misheard a voice.

You're acting like a child!

Sorry for disturbing you,
please go to sleep.

-Let’s go home Auntie.
-You're acting so childish. You are!

[Ifran] I've
changed the sheet and blanket.

I'm sure Irfan is lying,
my gut feeling is really strong!

Auntie, where is the proof? We have none!

1248
01:29:41.875 --> 01:29:45.500
You did hear the woman's voice
in the room, didn't you?

1249
01:29:46.041 --> 01:29:49.208
Yes, it's really a woman,
but what if it's something else?

1250
01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:51.916
-Don't try to scare me!
-Okay, listen…

1251
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.333
Let's assume your gut is right
and then you tell this to Norma.

1252
01:29:55.416 --> 01:29:59.208
Norma and Irfan get divorced for your gut,
are you willing to bear the sin?

[perky music]

1254
01:30:03.125 --> 01:30:06.333
It would be better if you focused
on my phone that's totally dead.

1255
01:30:07.125 --> 01:30:08.416
Auntie will buy and replace mine, right?

1256
01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:09.666
[In English] Stop!

1257
01:30:10.708 --> 01:30:14.625
-My gut said it can be fixed, Auntie.
-Fix it yourself, then!

Excuse me.

And she said, "Why do you always
come home at lunchtime?"

I just said,
"It's a one-hour break, Auntie."

-Yes, thank you, Honey.

-Who passed away?
-Putri.

Putri, who is the same age as my daughter?

Yes, it's Haji Maleh's daughter.

we must learn and also emulate, right?

01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:51.666
[Dad] Irfan and you are fine, right?

1285
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:54.666
We are fine, why Dad?

1286
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:59.333
Oh nothing, I was just asking you.

-Oh my God, long time no see.

-I miss you so much!
-How are you Ummi?

Mom is also with me.

Ummi, we're leaving first, is it okay?

1294
01:32:14.083 --> 01:32:15.833
But come visit me sometime, okay?

1295
01:32:15.916 --> 01:32:18.125
Just because you're teaching
doesn't mean you should rarely see me.

1296
01:32:18.208 --> 01:32:20.083
I'll visit you again next time!

[Norma] Umm.

01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:32.958
Mom, do you think Irfan is lying to me?

1300
01:32:33.958 --> 01:32:35.833
I keep thinking…

1301
01:32:36.708 --> 01:32:40.833
why does he come home
every lunchtime without telling me?

1302
01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.416
Why don’t you just ask him?

1303
01:32:44.375 --> 01:32:49.833
I'm afraid, he will keep
calling me suspicious.

1304
01:32:49.916 --> 01:32:51.541
I told you from the start…

1305
01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:55.000
I didn't agree with you marrying him.

1306
01:32:55.583 --> 01:32:56.708
It's proven, isn't it?

1307
01:32:57.833 --> 01:32:59.125
You were suspicious, right?

[Etni]
Who wouldn't fall in love with Irfan?

1313
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.833
He was trying to sweet-talk us,
but we didn't catch on.

1314
01:33:29.416 --> 01:33:31.583
We think he's being genuine, right?

1315
01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:34.458
We think he's a good boy.

1316
01:33:35.250 --> 01:33:36.833
Until finally, I found the texts…

1317
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.625
…I was really pissed off when I read it.

1318
01:33:39.708 --> 01:33:42.250
Because that woman,
doesn't look like a ‘mistress’ at all.

1319
01:33:42.333 --> 01:33:45.333
But she's more…like you.

[dramatic music]

1321

She wears a hijab,
soft-spoken, and mothering.

1322
01:33:52.291 --> 01:33:54.541
[Etni]That's why I wasn't surprised
when Irfan married you.

1323
01:33:55.416 --> 01:33:57.166
Because you're exactly his type, Norma.

1324
01:34:02.958 --> 01:34:05.000
[sigh] The only
thing that surprised me is…

1325
01:34:05.583 --> 01:34:07.208
…he still has another girl.

1326
01:34:07.291 --> 01:34:09.291
And yes, she looks like you.

1327
01:34:12.291 --> 01:34:14.375
[Etni] You shouldn't be insecure, Norma.

1328
01:34:16.833 --> 01:34:18.416
What do you really want?

1329
01:34:20.708 --> 01:34:22.958
Because Irfan finally got what he wanted.

1330
01:34:23.541 --> 01:34:24.750
I only want you.

I'm calling my Mom,
but she's not picking up.

Maybe Mom's stall is busy now…

1341

You'd better go home quickly!

1342

Alright then, I'll go home first
so I don't get there too late.

Give my regards to Irfan
and tell him 'Happy Birthday'.

[Auntie] I'm disgusted by looking at you!

-Oh my God! Dad.

Please don’t say that!

So, there's no need to say sorry.
You didn't do anything wrong.

Do you know

why I feel guilty towards you, Dear?

[Dad] Actually, I already suspected
that Mom liked Irfan.

But I couldn't bring myself
to tell you, Dear.

I also didn't expect…

…that your husband had the
same feelings towards your Mom.

Do you remember what I taught you before?

Trust in God with all your heart.

I can't bear to see Mom anymore!

I don't know how to see her the same.

but please don’t hate your own mother.

What matters most now is
that you pray to God…

Ask Allah in prayer…

My only prayer might be…

1775
02:11:05.958 --> 02:11:10.666
When I get to be a mother,

1776
02:11:11.666 --> 02:11:14.250
I wish to be granted the capacity
to love my child boundlessly.

1777
02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:15.916
Just as God loves me.

1778
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:23.666
"IT IS ENOUGH OF A SIN
FOR A PERSON THAT NEGLECTS…"

1779
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:28.666
"…THOSE FOR WHOM HE IS RESPONSIBLE."
