1
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:07.958
Honey, we finally caught the bird!

2
00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:10.708
-Really?
-Yes!

3
00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.750
-Then come home quickly.
-Okay.

4
00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:15.041
Make sure you prepare the cage quickly.

5
00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:17.083
-Sure, I'll prepare it.
-Okay.

6
00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:33.916
Help!

7
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:37.208
Help!

8
00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.791
Help!

9
00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.666
I'm going first, Ipung!

10
00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:14.791
Out of the way!

11
00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:16.541
Where are you going?

12
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.583
Slow down.

13
00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:20.583
Didit!

14
00:04:23.541 --> 00:04:24.625
It's over there.

15
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:27.791
The string is over there.

16
00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:29.083
Come on!

17
00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:30.291
-I'm first!
-I'm first!

18
00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:31.583
I'm going first!

19
00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.666
I saw it first.

20
00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.666
Hey, watch out.

21
00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:40.625
There it is, Ipung!

22
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.750
Ipung! Didit! Don't go in there!

23
00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:55.291
Over here!

24
00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:57.166
Stop, hey!

25
00:04:57.833 --> 00:05:01.583
-Oh, no, why did it go in there?
-Damn.

26
00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:05.708
Hey, we can't chase the kite
all the way in there, can we?

27
00:05:06.583 --> 00:05:08.041
Let's just check.

28
00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:09.583
Maybe it's not far.

29
00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:13.416
Ipung! Don't go there.

30
00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:15.833
Why not?

31
00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:20.166
Hey, did you know,
when Mr. Sutar passed by here yesterday,

32
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.666
he heard strange noises.

33
00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:24.958
Like someone was following him.

34
00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:26.666
Really?

35
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.958
Mr. Sutar must be lying.

36
00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:31.083
Yeah. Let's just check it out.

37
00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:35.041
Why? This is my share.
Why are you following me?

38
00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:37.750
How come? No way.
First come, first served!

39
00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:41.708
No fair!
You want to take everything? No way!

40
00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:45.375
Stop it, you two. Don't fight.

41
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:47.583
You know what?

42
00:05:47.666 --> 00:05:49.666
Since Mr. Pete was found here,

43
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.583
this area has become dangerous.

44
00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:54.208
Look to your left, your right.

45
00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:56.458
It's so dark.

46
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.875
My father has warned me
to come home before dusk.

47
00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.500
Haven't you been warned too?

48
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.708
Yeah. I have.

49
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.083
Fine then, Ipung. Get it yourself.

50
00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:10.833
What do you mean?

51
00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:14.583
I'm the one who asked you
but you're going to leave me now, Didit?

52
00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:20.875
-Ipung, let's just go home.
-What?

53
00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:24.458
We can chase other fallen kites
tomorrow, Ipung.

54
00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:30.750
Here. Take my kite.

55
00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.958
It's a bit torn, but it's okay.

56
00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:36.250
Here.

57
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:05.875
Ipung! Let's go home. It's dusk already.

58
00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.875
-Just a minute!
-Come on, let's go!

59
00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:10.708
Hurry. Your grandparents will be angry.

60
00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:24.416
-I'm going ahead!
-See you, Lis!

61
00:07:27.833 --> 00:07:28.666
See you!

62
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.583
Do you know even what time is it?

63
00:07:32.625 --> 00:07:34.166
-See you!
-Bye.

64
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.833
Done.

65
00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.333
Move it, Dad.

66
00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:41.916
Where have you been?

67
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.916
Huh? Why are you bathing them
at this hour?

68
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.083
Hey, boy.

69
00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:52.500
Yeah, I just got the chance.

70
00:07:52.583 --> 00:07:56.666
So, who's competing
in tomorrow's contest, Grandpa?

71
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.375
-Is it Petruk again?
-I don't think so.

72
00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:03.458
Let's give others a chance.
Petruk can't keep winning all the time.

73
00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:06.333
-Then who?
-I don't know.

74
00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:09.791
I'll meditate first tomorrow
to seek enlightenment.

75
00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:13.750
How fancy. You even need to meditate.

76
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.166
All right. I'm heading home now.

77
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.500
Yeah. Before it's dusk.

78
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.333
-Go home and take a bath.
-Yes, sir.

79
00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:25.333
I look forward to your meditation results.

80
00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:26.500
Okay.

81
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.375
Grandpa Manto.

82
00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:39.875
Have you been here long?

83
00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.583
Well, quite a while.

84
00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:47.000
Just stopping by to get some sage leaves
for the turtledove's herbal medicine.

85
00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:48.916
I see.

86
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Well, then.

87
00:08:50.083 --> 00:08:51.250
I'll head home now.

88
00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:53.666
-Okay, Grandpa. Take care.
-Sure.

89
00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:09.625
-What are you doing, Grandpa?
-Well, you see…

90
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.416
Right.

91
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.541
Why did Grandpa Manto leave so early?

92
00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:18.750
He said he was in a hurry
due to some business.

93
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Grandpa.

94
00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:26.625
Grandpa Darmo just told me that
Petruk won't be in tomorrow's contest.

95
00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:27.583
What?

96
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.500
-Really?
-Yes.

97
00:09:31.583 --> 00:09:35.583
If that's the case,
clearly no one can compete with Arjuna.

98
00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:36.583
Perfect.

99
00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:37.958
Of course.

100
00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:42.083
-Let me try, Grandpa.
-Sure.

101
00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:43.875
-Teach me, okay?
-Yes.

102
00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:46.958
I'll give it right away.

103
00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:50.166
Not like that. Don't give it directly.

104
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.666
First stroke and massage its head.

105
00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:57.541
Then feed it slowly.

106
00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:02.375
Yes, like that.

107
00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:04.916
You need to practice often to be smooth.

108
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.208
Got it!

109
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:08.416
This is a piece of cake, Grandpa.

110
00:10:09.916 --> 00:10:11.166
Let's practice first.

111
00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:21.583
Ipung, not like that.

112
00:10:21.666 --> 00:10:23.166
There's a rhythm to it.

113
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:24.833
How?

114
00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:25.916
Listen.

115
00:10:33.916 --> 00:10:35.916
That's how it should be.

116
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.041
Ipung!

117
00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:38.625
Stop whistling.

118
00:10:38.708 --> 00:10:40.250
It's already dusk.

119
00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:42.958
Instead of going home
and changing clothes,

120
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:44.916
you came here!

121
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.583
I know.

122
00:10:46.666 --> 00:10:49.125
I'll take a bath and change after this.

123
00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:52.291
You should have bathed in the afternoon.
No one bathes at dusk.

124
00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:54.708
And you too!

125
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:59.416
You don't even remind your own grandson!

126
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.875
Hey. Ipung.

127
00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:02.500
Hurry up.

128
00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:04.541
Before Grandma scolds you again.

129
00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:06.875
Okay.

130
00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:15.708
Ipung! How many times
do I have to tell you?

131
00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:17.416
I know, Grandma.

132
00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:02.125
Honey.

133
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:05.375
Honey.

134
00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.041
Who is it?

135
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.500
Who is it?

136
00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:32.458
Who is it?

137
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.125
Honey.

138
00:16:14.791 --> 00:16:16.208
Can you come back now?

139
00:16:33.916 --> 00:16:35.625
-Honey.
-Yes?

140
00:16:35.708 --> 00:16:38.958
-Talk to your grandson.
-What?

141
00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.916
He's becoming more and more like you.

142
00:16:44.458 --> 00:16:48.375
Well, he's just a kid.

143
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:50.458
It's normal.

144
00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:54.333
He'll figure things out when he's older.

145
00:16:54.416 --> 00:16:56.000
That's exactly why.

146
00:16:56.083 --> 00:17:00.166
Don't teach him anything weird
while he's still young.

147
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.625
-What am I even teaching him?
-Well…

148
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.791
He's always obsessing over birds now.

149
00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:10.541
Don't let it get out of hand.

150
00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:13.333
Yes. I know.

151
00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:18.500
This must be

152
00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:22.958
because you're thinking about Agus Pete.

153
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.500
Isn't that right?

154
00:17:28.166 --> 00:17:29.041
Listen.

155
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.166
Have you forgotten?

156
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:36.958
Back then, people disappeared
without a trace.

157
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:39.416
Those things don't happen anymore.

158
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:41.125
It's safe now.

159
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.000
If it's safe, why is it still like this?

160
00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:47.000
Like what?

161
00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:48.791
Agus Pete?

162
00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:51.791
He's still around, isn't he?
Still alive and well.

163
00:17:55.083 --> 00:17:57.958
See! The kid's whistling again.

164
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.708
I'll talk to him after this.

165
00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:03.416
I'm heading out now.

166
00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.208
Please get my jacket.

167
00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:18.708
Ipung.

168
00:18:19.916 --> 00:18:21.041
What is it, Grandpa?

169
00:18:21.125 --> 00:18:23.625
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

170
00:18:25.208 --> 00:18:26.666
When it's dusk,

171
00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:30.541
as Grandma has reminded you,

172
00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:33.958
you should stop whistling.

173
00:18:34.583 --> 00:18:36.833
-It's dangerous.
-Come on, Grandpa.

174
00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:38.666
It's just whistling.

175
00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:41.958
You're allowed to do it.
Why can't I do it?

176
00:18:42.041 --> 00:18:45.291
Enough! Just listen to your Grandma.

177
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:47.666
Okay?

178
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.875
Ipung.

179
00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.208
If you behave,

180
00:18:51.416 --> 00:18:54.708
you can come with me to the competition.

181
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.083
The competition.

182
00:18:56.166 --> 00:18:57.708
-Really, Grandpa?
-Yes.

183
00:18:57.791 --> 00:18:58.875
Awesome!

184
00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:02.541
Here, Ipung.

185
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:05.458
I've got something nice for you.

186
00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:09.583
This was my toy when I was little.

187
00:19:16.666 --> 00:19:18.041
-Let me try it, Grandpa.
-Sure.

188
00:19:24.458 --> 00:19:25.541
-Thank you, Grandpa.
-Yes.

189
00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:28.250
Now, I'm going on patrol.

190
00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:29.166
Okay.

191
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.083
-Be good, okay?
-Yes, Grandpa.

192
00:19:39.166 --> 00:19:41.458
Help!

193
00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:42.833
Grandpa.

194
00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:43.958
What?

195
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:46.041
What happened to Grandpa Darmo?

196
00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:48.125
I came here earlier

197
00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:51.333
-to pick up Grandpa Darmo for the patrol.
-Okay.

198
00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:53.458
I called, but there was no answer.

199
00:19:53.541 --> 00:19:56.291
Then I went in, but no one was inside.

200
00:19:56.375 --> 00:19:58.916
Then I found him collapsed.

201
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.875
Grandpa Darmo was on the floor.

202
00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:03.333
What should we do now?

203
00:20:03.416 --> 00:20:05.625
Grandpa! What should we do with him?

204
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.166
-Let's carry him outside.
-Okay! Let's go!

205
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.458
-Where is he?
-There. Inside. There he is.

206
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:21.375
News of passing. Indeed, we belong to God,
and indeed, to Him we shall return.

207
00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:28.291
This is to inform
all Kertorangking people,

208
00:20:28.375 --> 00:20:33.750
It is with great sorrow that we announce
the passing of

209
00:20:34.458 --> 00:20:38.333
Mr. Darmo…

210
00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:50.125
You have to eat something.

211
00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.625
Then drink your herbal medicine.

212
00:20:53.166 --> 00:20:56.291
His body is laid on

213
00:20:56.375 --> 00:21:01.208
his family residence.

214
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:16.916
Honey?

215
00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:21.166
Honey?

216
00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.791
Honey? Honey!

217
00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:29.583
Honey.

218
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.791
Honey.

219
00:22:21.916 --> 00:22:22.916
Grandpa?

220
00:22:37.041 --> 00:22:38.125
Grandpa?

221
00:22:53.833 --> 00:22:54.666
Grandpa?

222
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:02.250
Grandpa?

223
00:23:12.875 --> 00:23:13.875
Grandpa?

224
00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:19.750
What's wrong, Grandpa?

225
00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:23.166
Why are all the birds released?

226
00:23:29.833 --> 00:23:30.875
Grandpa?

227
00:23:40.833 --> 00:23:41.833
Grandpa.

228
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:46.125
Grandpa.

229
00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:54.625
Grandpa.

230
00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:06.083
Grandpa.

231
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.083
Grandpa?

232
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.625
Ipung.

233
00:24:29.375 --> 00:24:30.875
Please help Grandma.

234
00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:39.291
Grandpa?

235
00:24:52.583 --> 00:24:55.583
Ipung.

236
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.916
What do you need help with?

237
00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:10.625
This.

238
00:25:11.708 --> 00:25:13.541
Just need to put this in?

239
00:25:15.791 --> 00:25:18.458
Where's Grandpa?
He was calling me earlier.

240
00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:33.791
Whoa!

241
00:25:34.625 --> 00:25:37.458
She just left like that.

242
00:25:55.416 --> 00:25:57.041
That's not me.

243
00:25:57.833 --> 00:25:59.208
Come here quickly.

244
00:26:12.583 --> 00:26:18.291
Ipung.

245
00:26:18.375 --> 00:26:20.791
Grandma, who is that?

246
00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:25.958
Ipung.

247
00:26:33.541 --> 00:26:36.333
Ipung.

248
00:26:43.125 --> 00:26:43.958
Grandma?

249
00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:53.666
Grandma!

250
00:27:09.208 --> 00:27:10.583
Just put it here.

251
00:27:10.666 --> 00:27:13.583
Please get two chairs.
Put them here. Hurry up.

252
00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:15.541
Good, leave it there.

253
00:27:15.625 --> 00:27:17.583
-Where should I put it?
-Lean it there.

254
00:27:19.041 --> 00:27:21.750
I feel really bad about Grandpa Darmo.

255
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.791
By the way,
how did Grandpa Darmo pass away?

256
00:27:24.875 --> 00:27:25.750
What happened?

257
00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:30.208
Last night, someone was going
to pick him up for the night patrol.

258
00:27:30.291 --> 00:27:33.333
But they found him on the kitchen floor.

259
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.333
And, unfortunately, he died right there.

260
00:27:38.958 --> 00:27:40.291
My goodness.

261
00:27:40.375 --> 00:27:44.041
Even though many people said
that Grandpa Darmo had a protection.

262
00:27:44.791 --> 00:27:48.500
Usually, people with protection
don't die easily.

263
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.291
Yet he died just from slipping.

264
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.916
Speak carefully.

265
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.375
Did he really have
a supernatural protection?

266
00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:01.375
How do you know?

267
00:28:01.458 --> 00:28:05.166
Many people have said so.

268
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.916
Many people have disappeared here.

269
00:28:08.916 --> 00:28:11.166
People said they were eaten by ghosts!

270
00:28:12.208 --> 00:28:14.000
Don't tell such strange stories!

271
00:28:14.083 --> 00:28:15.833
You don't believe me?

272
00:28:15.916 --> 00:28:20.375
That's why many elders here
have a protection to stay safe.

273
00:28:22.625 --> 00:28:27.166
But is it true that such things
still exist in this modern age?

274
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.958
Well, what's important
is to live righteously,

275
00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:31.833
and be diligent in worship.

276
00:28:31.916 --> 00:28:34.791
And you should repent quickly.

277
00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:37.750
Why me? You go first.

278
00:28:37.833 --> 00:28:41.208
Then I'll follow your lead. Right?

279
00:28:41.291 --> 00:28:43.958
No way. I'm too busy.

280
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:46.666
-Quiet. You'll wake up Grandpa Darmo.
-Bullshit.

281
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.083
What about Wiwik's husband?

282
00:28:49.166 --> 00:28:50.875
Still like a walking corpse?

283
00:28:50.958 --> 00:28:52.416
Yes, obviously.

284
00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:56.875
Pete is the same
whether he's sick or healthy, right?

285
00:28:56.958 --> 00:28:59.291
-Can't do anything. Isn't that right?
-Yes, correct.

286
00:28:59.375 --> 00:29:01.833
Wiwik is really something else.

287
00:29:01.916 --> 00:29:04.750
How could she even marry Pete?

288
00:29:04.833 --> 00:29:08.916
-Right! His life is a mess.
-We told her, but she wouldn't listen.

289
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.625
Is there anything I can help with?

290
00:29:12.166 --> 00:29:13.166
Here, Wiwik.

291
00:29:14.125 --> 00:29:18.208
Here. Bring it inside.
Before the guests leave.

292
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.833
Wiwik.

293
00:29:33.541 --> 00:29:38.041
I heard you're planning
to hold a ceremony?

294
00:29:39.083 --> 00:29:40.541
Yes, for my husband.

295
00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:50.458
-Wiwik, can you make more tea?
-Sure.

296
00:30:07.958 --> 00:30:10.875
Wiwik, have you checked yet?

297
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.375
Checked what?

298
00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:18.458
I heard your husband, Pete,
just got a bird as a pet.

299
00:30:18.541 --> 00:30:20.000
Maybe his illness is--

300
00:30:21.708 --> 00:30:22.958
I've taken him to the clinic.

301
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.375
They said he had a stroke.

302
00:30:36.166 --> 00:30:37.750
-Here's your drink.
-Yes.

303
00:30:46.916 --> 00:30:48.500
Is this your toy, Ipung?

304
00:30:49.375 --> 00:30:50.291
Yes, Auntie.

305
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.583
It must have fallen
when I grabbed my phone.

306
00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:56.375
-Thanks, Auntie.
-Sure.

307
00:30:57.083 --> 00:30:58.083
Excuse me.

308
00:31:24.416 --> 00:31:26.166
-Hurry up!
-Okay.

309
00:31:27.708 --> 00:31:29.291
What's wrong, Grandpa?

310
00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:31.958
Grandpa?

311
00:31:32.041 --> 00:31:34.375
Stop asking so many questions!
Hurry up and get in!

312
00:31:34.458 --> 00:31:36.208
You're troublesome and slow!

313
00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:37.541
What do you mean?

314
00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:40.750
-How dare you talk back?
-Just throw him inside!

315
00:31:42.625 --> 00:31:48.875
Take that!

316
00:32:01.791 --> 00:32:05.125
No!

317
00:32:36.583 --> 00:32:37.791
I'm coming!

318
00:32:47.125 --> 00:32:51.000
Grandma, why did you knock
so hard on the door?

319
00:32:51.458 --> 00:32:53.250
Who knocked?

320
00:32:53.333 --> 00:32:54.708
I've been here the whole time.

321
00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:06.041
What's wrong?

322
00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:09.208
I was haunted in my dream.

323
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.333
I'm sorry, Grandma. I'm really scared.

324
00:33:13.875 --> 00:33:16.833
In my dream, you weren't yourself.

325
00:33:16.916 --> 00:33:19.166
I was buried alive, Grandma!

326
00:33:20.958 --> 00:33:24.000
That's why
you should listen to your elders.

327
00:33:24.583 --> 00:33:26.875
Or you'll have nightmares like that.

328
00:33:28.333 --> 00:33:29.416
That is why

329
00:33:30.541 --> 00:33:32.583
you need to stop whistling all the time.

330
00:33:33.833 --> 00:33:35.875
You're lucky it was only in your dream.

331
00:33:37.958 --> 00:33:39.333
What if it happens for real?

332
00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:51.000
Grandma!

333
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.458
You really forgive me, right, Grandma?

334
00:33:54.541 --> 00:33:57.291
Please forgive me quickly!
Forgive me, Grandma!

335
00:33:57.375 --> 00:33:59.208
Yes, all right.

336
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.375
Are you going with your Grandpa?

337
00:34:02.833 --> 00:34:03.958
Yes.

338
00:34:04.458 --> 00:34:06.666
Look, he is getting ready now.

339
00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:09.833
Go and take a shower.

340
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:36.208
Give me back my husband.

341
00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:39.750
Give me back my husband now.

342
00:35:30.083 --> 00:35:32.208
-Hello.
-Hey.

343
00:35:32.291 --> 00:35:33.833
-Ready?
-Yes.

344
00:35:35.125 --> 00:35:38.208
-What number did you get?
-Not yet. I haven't got a number yet.

345
00:35:39.375 --> 00:35:40.375
Ipung!

346
00:35:43.208 --> 00:35:46.625
-Yes, Grandpa?
-Please help me get a number first.

347
00:35:46.708 --> 00:35:49.250
-Here's the money. Over there.
-Okay.

348
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.333
-Here you go, sir.
-Yes.

349
00:35:53.416 --> 00:35:55.833
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

350
00:35:55.916 --> 00:35:57.125
-Who's this?
-Here, sir.

351
00:35:57.666 --> 00:35:59.291
-Sakti, right?
-Yes, Sakti.

352
00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:03.125
Okay. Here you go, sir.

353
00:36:03.208 --> 00:36:04.708
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

354
00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:08.250
Hey, look at you, Ipung!

355
00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:10.916
-Ready to be your grandfather's successor?
-Yes, Uncle.

356
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.083
-Do you have your own bird yet?
-Not yet.

357
00:36:13.166 --> 00:36:17.458
Then ask your grandpa! He has many.
Then register here under your own name.

358
00:36:17.541 --> 00:36:20.000
I've asked,
but Grandpa hasn't given me one yet.

359
00:36:20.083 --> 00:36:23.541
Well, you must keep trying.

360
00:36:23.625 --> 00:36:24.791
Stay motivated, Ipung.

361
00:36:24.875 --> 00:36:26.583
Don't give up, Ipung.

362
00:36:26.666 --> 00:36:28.375
-Who is it today? Arjuna?
-Arjuna.

363
00:36:30.375 --> 00:36:31.208
Okay, here.

364
00:36:31.958 --> 00:36:34.541
-Here.
-Okay. Please, take it.

365
00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:36.250
-Thanks, Ipung.
-Yes, thanks!

366
00:36:36.333 --> 00:36:37.375
You're welcome.

367
00:36:38.166 --> 00:36:39.000
Kang.

368
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.125
Is it true?

369
00:36:42.041 --> 00:36:46.875
Darmo died because Petruk died?

370
00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:49.166
Yes.

371
00:36:50.458 --> 00:36:53.583
Because of Petruk's death,
no power was looking after Darmo.

372
00:36:54.583 --> 00:36:56.541
He put his protection in that bird.

373
00:36:59.166 --> 00:37:00.166
I see.

374
00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:01.250
But it seems like

375
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:06.125
it has something to do with Agus Pete.

376
00:37:06.208 --> 00:37:10.625
Look, in previous incidents,

377
00:37:10.708 --> 00:37:13.958
the people disappeared too,
passing to the other world.

378
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:19.750
If Agus Pete is really the culprit,
why hasn't he disappeared?

379
00:37:19.833 --> 00:37:21.500
What's really going on?

380
00:37:21.583 --> 00:37:23.208
What taboo did he break?

381
00:37:25.666 --> 00:37:27.791
That's what I've been thinking about.

382
00:37:27.875 --> 00:37:29.083
-Here, Grandpa.
-Okay, Ipung.

383
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.708
-Number 16.
-Yes.

384
00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:33.291
-Where's number 16?
-Right here.

385
00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:36.500
Oh, it's there.
Come on, let's take the bird there.

386
00:37:36.583 --> 00:37:38.000
Please be careful. Slowly.

387
00:39:29.125 --> 00:39:30.458
What's wrong? What's happening?

388
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:32.875
What's wrong with Grandma?

389
00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:37.125
Grandma?

390
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.458
Honey.

391
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:48.000
This isn't right anymore.

392
00:39:48.083 --> 00:39:49.833
No more excuses!

393
00:39:49.916 --> 00:39:52.958
I've made arrangements
with Brother Manto to fix all of this.

394
00:39:53.041 --> 00:39:56.250
Where's the safety you promised?
I almost died!

395
00:39:56.333 --> 00:39:58.958
Enough of that. Just do as I say!

396
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:14.166
Tirto?

397
00:40:17.583 --> 00:40:18.416
Tirto?

398
00:40:19.458 --> 00:40:20.375
Tirto.

399
00:41:39.583 --> 00:41:42.500
Don't come, don't disturb.

400
00:41:44.708 --> 00:41:47.625
Don't come, don't disturb.

401
00:42:23.416 --> 00:42:27.000
Pete!

402
00:42:29.166 --> 00:42:30.708
Come out, Pete!

403
00:42:39.166 --> 00:42:40.708
Come out, Pete!

404
00:42:43.208 --> 00:42:44.958
I need to talk.

405
00:42:49.875 --> 00:42:51.000
Pete!

406
00:42:54.458 --> 00:42:55.458
Pete!

407
00:42:57.625 --> 00:42:58.708
Why

408
00:43:00.208 --> 00:43:03.875
are you targeting the villagers?

409
00:43:10.375 --> 00:43:13.208
Because I need to exchange places.

410
00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:16.875
So I can get out!

411
00:43:19.291 --> 00:43:20.666
What's wrong with you?

412
00:43:22.416 --> 00:43:24.083
What happened to you?

413
00:43:29.166 --> 00:43:30.125
Pete!

414
00:43:35.541 --> 00:43:38.625
What do you want?

415
00:43:52.541 --> 00:43:54.875
You're doing it wrong, Pete.

416
00:43:56.791 --> 00:43:58.416
If this is how you do it…

417
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.875
you might as well stay here forever.

418
00:44:05.333 --> 00:44:07.041
Speak up, Pete.

419
00:44:08.708 --> 00:44:10.416
Answer me.

420
00:44:31.625 --> 00:44:34.166
This is Ganda Rumbing's doing.

421
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.958
Agus Pete opened the portal again.

422
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.041
So it's true, Brother?

423
00:44:43.125 --> 00:44:46.500
Agus Pete is the one hunting villagers?

424
00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:47.500
Yes.

425
00:44:48.541 --> 00:44:50.541
Because he's being held captive.

426
00:44:52.375 --> 00:44:54.375
He was given a condition.

427
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:59.083
He can leave
if he can find his replacement.

428
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:05.916
If he can't find a replacement
within 40 days,

429
00:45:06.458 --> 00:45:08.250
he will vanish.

430
00:45:09.416 --> 00:45:10.583
Damn him.

431
00:45:11.416 --> 00:45:16.250
Now, it was Agus Pete who took Darmo.

432
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:20.375
But Darmo died first.

433
00:45:33.875 --> 00:45:34.833
Wiwik.

434
00:45:54.041 --> 00:45:58.416
After what happened yesterday,

435
00:46:00.333 --> 00:46:05.625
there are still no signs
of your husband returning, right?

436
00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:10.916
Not yet.

437
00:46:12.166 --> 00:46:15.083
Even though there are only six days left.

438
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.041
What should I do?

439
00:46:28.541 --> 00:46:30.000
In that case,

440
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:36.875
you must give the potion

441
00:46:36.958 --> 00:46:41.500
to someone who can help you.

442
00:46:44.291 --> 00:46:45.833
Who could it be?

443
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:55.375
There's one thing you must find.

444
00:46:59.125 --> 00:47:01.375
Warm blood.

445
00:47:03.666 --> 00:47:07.333
Your husband will give you the sign.

446
00:47:08.541 --> 00:47:09.875
The important thing is,

447
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:14.208
you must be able to read that sign.

448
00:47:14.291 --> 00:47:15.166
And…

449
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.833
give that potion to that person.

450
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.250
Don't run out of time.

451
00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:26.625
If you run out of time…

452
00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:33.375
your husband will vanish.

453
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.250
-One, two, three,
-…two, three,

454
00:47:51.333 --> 00:47:56.750
-four, five, six, seven, eight.
-four, five, six, seven, eight.

455
00:47:56.833 --> 00:48:00.833
Now pull your right hand to the left side.

456
00:48:01.416 --> 00:48:03.500
-One, two…
-Ipung.

457
00:48:04.291 --> 00:48:06.375
I heard you have a bird whistle.

458
00:48:06.458 --> 00:48:08.583
And they say your whistle is powerful.

459
00:48:08.666 --> 00:48:10.083
Really, Ipung?

460
00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:14.416
Does that whistle
really make birds turn into cobras?

461
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.875
Of course not.

462
00:48:16.583 --> 00:48:19.541
At most, they turn into dolphins.

463
00:48:19.625 --> 00:48:21.500
Is there really such a whistle?

464
00:48:21.583 --> 00:48:23.875
Of course. My grandfather has one.

465
00:48:24.541 --> 00:48:27.041
My grandfather has one too.

466
00:48:27.125 --> 00:48:30.291
But my grandfather doesn't have one.
Let me see it, Ipung.

467
00:48:30.375 --> 00:48:32.750
…seven, eight.

468
00:48:32.833 --> 00:48:34.458
Now hold your chins.

469
00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:35.708
Wow, this is cool!

470
00:48:35.791 --> 00:48:37.416
Turn your head to the right.

471
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.833
-This is nice, Ipung.
-Come on.

472
00:48:39.916 --> 00:48:43.041
You can find plenty of these
at the bird market.

473
00:48:43.125 --> 00:48:44.041
No way!

474
00:48:44.125 --> 00:48:45.916
Not everyone has this.

475
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.875
My grandfather says this is a rare item.
You can't find it in the market.

476
00:48:49.958 --> 00:48:51.333
He's just exaggerating.

477
00:48:51.416 --> 00:48:53.208
Hey! Watch your mouth.

478
00:48:53.291 --> 00:48:54.375
I've seen this.

479
00:48:54.458 --> 00:48:56.291
-No way.
-I have.

480
00:48:56.375 --> 00:48:57.666
There is no way!

481
00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.833
-You're stubborn. It exists.
-No, it doesn't.

482
00:49:00.916 --> 00:49:02.916
-It doesn't exist.
-Put your hands forward.

483
00:49:04.666 --> 00:49:05.875
Hey, Ipung.

484
00:49:05.958 --> 00:49:07.333
What's wrong with your mouth?

485
00:49:07.958 --> 00:49:10.791
…eight.

486
00:49:10.875 --> 00:49:12.250
Put your arms down.

487
00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:17.666
One, two, three, four,

488
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:23.083
five, six, seven, eight.

489
00:49:37.458 --> 00:49:38.750
Hey! Ipung!

490
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.750
Stop joking around!

491
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:46.083
Ipung!

492
00:50:23.708 --> 00:50:25.916
One of them is through predation.

493
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.250
What's wrong, Ipung?

494
00:50:27.333 --> 00:50:29.000
What do you call them?

495
00:50:29.083 --> 00:50:31.333
-Predator.
-Predator.

496
00:50:31.416 --> 00:50:33.291
Yes, predator.

497
00:50:33.375 --> 00:50:36.916
Ipung?

498
00:51:22.125 --> 00:51:25.458
-What's wrong with you, Ipung?
-Nothing.

499
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:27.583
Oh, right.

500
00:51:29.416 --> 00:51:31.250
Here's your turtledove whistle.

501
00:51:31.333 --> 00:51:33.208
Why do you have it?

502
00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:35.416
You lent it to me earlier.

503
00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.666
Oh, that's right.

504
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:37.750
Thank you.

505
00:51:46.375 --> 00:51:47.250
Where are you going?

506
00:51:48.375 --> 00:51:50.625
You run like seeing a ghost.

507
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.416
How are you feeling?

508
00:52:03.125 --> 00:52:06.208
I feel nauseous, like I've caught a cold.

509
00:52:14.583 --> 00:52:15.416
Wait.

510
00:52:16.041 --> 00:52:18.916
Did you take what was in here?

511
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.166
Yes, I threw it in the river.

512
00:52:22.708 --> 00:52:23.541
What?

513
00:52:24.166 --> 00:52:25.208
What were you thinking?

514
00:52:25.791 --> 00:52:27.750
You can't just act carelessly.

515
00:52:29.208 --> 00:52:33.750
Since I was the one who put it there,
I should have been the one to remove it.

516
00:52:33.833 --> 00:52:35.125
So what do we do now?

517
00:52:36.666 --> 00:52:39.208
You might be sick because of this.

518
00:52:40.708 --> 00:52:42.166
I have to fix this now.

519
00:52:52.875 --> 00:52:58.750
WELCOME TO KERTORANGKING VILLAGE

520
00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:09.625
Kid, do you know
where is Grandpa Mirkun's house?

521
00:53:10.541 --> 00:53:11.541
Over there.

522
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.833
That's my grandfather's house.

523
00:53:13.916 --> 00:53:15.333
Really?

524
00:53:15.416 --> 00:53:17.208
Grandpa Mirkun is your grandfather?

525
00:53:17.291 --> 00:53:18.125
Yes.

526
00:53:18.208 --> 00:53:19.375
Let's bring him with us.

527
00:53:19.458 --> 00:53:21.958
As it happens, I'm heading there too.

528
00:53:22.916 --> 00:53:25.375
-How about we go together?
-Sure, Uncle.

529
00:53:25.458 --> 00:53:26.708
-Come on, get on.
-Yes.

530
00:53:27.208 --> 00:53:29.375
-Get on, kid.
-Thanks, Uncle.

531
00:53:29.458 --> 00:53:30.541
Yes, get on.

532
00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:32.833
Come on, get on, kid.

533
00:53:32.916 --> 00:53:34.916
Over here.

534
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.416
Come on.

535
00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.750
-Sit there.
-Yes, right there.

536
00:53:41.208 --> 00:53:42.875
Let's get moving.

537
00:53:43.666 --> 00:53:46.125
-What's wrong, kid?
-Nothing.

538
00:53:47.208 --> 00:53:50.541
-Why is your face so pale?
-It's nothing.

539
00:53:51.333 --> 00:53:53.583
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yes, Uncle.

540
00:53:54.125 --> 00:53:56.458
Why are you guys going to Grandpa's house?

541
00:53:56.541 --> 00:53:58.208
To pay our respects, of course.

542
00:53:59.291 --> 00:54:01.375
Oh my! Are you lost here, kid?

543
00:54:01.875 --> 00:54:05.541
Once you're lost like this,
it's hard to find your way back.

544
00:54:05.625 --> 00:54:07.125
Better stay here. Right?

545
00:54:07.208 --> 00:54:09.666
Ask if he wants to go home or stay here.

546
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:12.000
Come on! This is for our entertainment.

547
00:54:12.083 --> 00:54:14.166
Just stay here!

548
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:17.875
-Accompany me, Son.
-No need to come home.

549
00:54:40.333 --> 00:54:44.416
Grandma!

550
00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:45.666
What's wrong?

551
00:54:47.583 --> 00:54:50.666
What's the matter?
Why are you such a mess like this?

552
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:55.166
I'm being followed by a ghost.
Help me, Grandma.

553
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:56.833
Come here.

554
00:54:57.666 --> 00:55:00.250
Don't be afraid. Grandma's here.

555
00:55:00.333 --> 00:55:03.250
The ghost is gone now.

556
00:55:04.541 --> 00:55:06.708
It's okay.

557
00:55:06.791 --> 00:55:09.666
Everything's fine now.

558
00:55:28.041 --> 00:55:30.750
Honey…

559
00:56:03.666 --> 00:56:05.000
Is this your toy, Ipung?

560
00:56:06.416 --> 00:56:07.333
Yes, Auntie.

561
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:36.958
Auntie.

562
00:56:37.916 --> 00:56:39.125
Ipung.

563
00:56:40.083 --> 00:56:41.625
Is your grandma home?

564
00:56:41.708 --> 00:56:44.041
She's lying down in her room, Auntie.

565
00:56:44.125 --> 00:56:45.041
Please come in.

566
00:56:45.125 --> 00:56:46.333
I'll call her for you.

567
00:56:46.416 --> 00:56:48.166
No need.

568
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:51.708
I just want to return
your grandmother's food container.

569
00:56:51.791 --> 00:56:53.541
Okay.

570
00:56:56.666 --> 00:56:58.500
Are you feeling unwell?

571
00:56:58.583 --> 00:57:00.125
Yes, Auntie.

572
00:57:00.958 --> 00:57:04.250
-Caught it from your grandmother?
-Yes, probably.

573
00:57:05.666 --> 00:57:09.250
I just bought some herbal medicine
from my regular place.

574
00:57:09.333 --> 00:57:13.166
Usually when I'm not feeling well,
this medicine helps me recover quickly.

575
00:57:14.458 --> 00:57:15.791
Here, drink it now.

576
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.166
So you'll get better soon.

577
00:57:22.791 --> 00:57:25.291
You'll feel much better after drinking it.

578
00:57:32.125 --> 00:57:34.416
-Here.
-Good boy.

579
00:57:38.708 --> 00:57:41.666
-I'll head home now.
-Okay.

580
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:44.041
Tell your grandmother that I stopped by.

581
00:57:44.125 --> 00:57:45.541
Yes, Auntie.

582
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.666
Thank you, Auntie.

583
00:57:56.541 --> 00:57:58.916
-You're welcome.
-Sure.

584
00:58:24.083 --> 00:58:26.708
Grandpa! Help, I'm inside!

585
00:58:28.041 --> 00:58:30.291
Grandpa! Please help me!

586
00:58:30.375 --> 00:58:31.416
Tirto!

587
00:58:35.916 --> 00:58:37.041
What is it?

588
00:58:37.125 --> 00:58:38.791
Cut the small talk.

589
00:58:38.875 --> 00:58:40.291
What's your connection with Pete?

590
00:58:41.125 --> 00:58:42.458
What do you mean?

591
00:58:46.541 --> 00:58:49.666
What did you do to Pete and Wiwik?

592
00:58:50.208 --> 00:58:55.375
I only help lost souls.

593
00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:58.791
What do you know about Pete?

594
00:59:10.083 --> 00:59:11.083
Pete!

595
00:59:13.125 --> 00:59:14.166
Hey!

596
00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:17.666
What did you do to my grandchild?

597
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:18.625
Pete!

598
00:59:18.708 --> 00:59:20.750
-Answer me now!
-Grandpa!

599
00:59:20.833 --> 00:59:23.125
What are you doing?

600
00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:26.166
You two are wicked people!

601
00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:28.708
What did you do to my wife and grandchild?

602
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:30.500
What do you mean?

603
00:59:30.583 --> 00:59:33.375
Don't pretend you don't know.
I know everything!

604
00:59:33.458 --> 00:59:37.250
Your husband ended up like this
because you wanted to be rich!

605
00:59:37.333 --> 00:59:38.666
Think it through!

606
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:41.625
If life is already miserable,
don't ask the devil for help!

607
00:59:41.708 --> 00:59:43.041
Don't talk nonsense!

608
00:59:43.125 --> 00:59:46.416
You think your husband will recover?

609
00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:47.500
He never will!

610
00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:49.958
He'll be like this until he dies.

611
00:59:50.666 --> 00:59:52.375
I curse you!

612
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:57.583
-Grandpa!
-You have no manners!

613
00:59:57.666 --> 01:00:00.000
Barging in
and making accusations without proof!

614
01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:03.333
-What do you mean?
-Child? Where are you?

615
01:00:03.416 --> 01:00:04.875
-Grandpa!
-Child?

616
01:00:04.958 --> 01:00:07.583
Don't do whatever you want
just because we're poor!

617
01:00:07.666 --> 01:00:10.041
-Grandpa!
-Where are you, child?

618
01:00:11.416 --> 01:00:13.250
Get out of here!

619
01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:17.875
Grandpa!

620
01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:21.541
Help me, Grandpa!

621
01:00:22.916 --> 01:00:23.916
Grandpa!

622
01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:28.708
Help me, Grandpa!

623
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:33.791
Grandpa, help! Grandpa!

624
01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:37.375
Grandpa, I'm here!

625
01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:42.375
Grandpa!

626
01:00:44.666 --> 01:00:46.791
Grandpa, help me!

627
01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:50.916
Grandpa!

628
01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:55.791
Brother Manto.

629
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.375
I really need your help.
My grandchild must return.

630
01:00:59.458 --> 01:01:00.291
Yes.

631
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.791
-I'll do my best.
-Yes. Thank you.

632
01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:33.333
Take this with you.

633
01:01:35.083 --> 01:01:37.000
This will help you.

634
01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.625
Ipung.

635
01:01:59.958 --> 01:02:01.291
Grandpa?

636
01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:02.708
Come here, Ipung.

637
01:02:03.416 --> 01:02:04.250
Grandpa?

638
01:02:07.958 --> 01:02:09.166
Grandpa?

639
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:15.833
Grandpa?

640
01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:19.000
Ipung.

641
01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:21.291
Grandpa?

642
01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:24.166
Grandpa!

643
01:02:25.625 --> 01:02:27.750
Grandpa?

644
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.166
Ipung.

645
01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:34.916
Grandpa?

646
01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:39.541
Come here, Ipung.

647
01:02:51.375 --> 01:02:52.541
Ipung.

648
01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:54.791
Come on.

649
01:03:04.916 --> 01:03:07.291
Ipung, come with me!

650
01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:13.000
Let's go!

651
01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:54.166
Grandpa.

652
01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:57.625
Grandpa?

653
01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:00.916
Ipung?

654
01:04:02.166 --> 01:04:03.000
Ipung.

655
01:04:04.125 --> 01:04:05.291
Ipung?

656
01:04:12.083 --> 01:04:13.083
Grandpa!

657
01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:15.333
Ipung.

658
01:04:20.833 --> 01:04:21.875
Ipung?

659
01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:24.625
Ipung!

660
01:04:27.666 --> 01:04:28.541
Grandpa.

661
01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:31.291
Ipung!

662
01:04:33.333 --> 01:04:34.666
Ipung!

663
01:04:35.916 --> 01:04:36.791
Grandpa.

664
01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:39.583
Ipung!

665
01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:40.916
Grandpa!

666
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.083
Ipung!

667
01:04:43.958 --> 01:04:46.875
Grandpa!

668
01:04:49.125 --> 01:04:51.583
Ipung!

669
01:04:51.666 --> 01:04:52.500
Grandpa!

670
01:04:53.333 --> 01:04:54.750
Grandpa? Grandpa!

671
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.875
Come on, Ipung! Run!

672
01:07:02.416 --> 01:07:06.541
Help!

673
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:15.166

Let's go!

Hey.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:09.833
-Are you feeling better now, Pete?

Anytime. I'm ready whenever.

-Did you buy the galangal?
-Yeah, I put it on the table.

Okay.

687
01:08:54.166 --> 01:08:56.708
Don't forget the tea for your Grandpa.
