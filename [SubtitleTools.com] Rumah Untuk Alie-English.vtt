WEBVTT

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.125
You got the job, huh?

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:51.917
Time to treat us, don't you think?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.792
I know. How about we go watch a movie?

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:57.083
Just 50,000 per person. That's nothing.

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.792
Just a movie?
Let's go somewhere afterwards.

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:01.208
Easy. You're not invited.

00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:03.167
- Agreed.
- You guys are a handful.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.625
- You guys are going to bankrupt me.
- It doesn't matter.

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:07.958
You guys are so lame.

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:10.125
- You're no different.
- Yeah.

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:12.083
Someday it's going to be your turn.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:13.458
Right?

00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:15.542
- What a snob.
- Whatever, man.

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:18.792
Relax.

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:19.875
Dipta.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:21.542
Dad.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:26.250
The most valuable thing you can do
in your career is to be honest.

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.458
- Be honest.
- Got it, Dad.

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:31.125
Good morning.

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:01.833
You shouldn't come to the dining room.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.542
You ruined the mood.

00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:10.625
Seeing your face this early in the morning
makes us all sick.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.333
They won't ever forget
that you're the reason Mom died.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:22.875
Move out of the way.

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:25.333
You're always in the way.

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:31.458
What?

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:33.667
Got something to say?

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.500
Spoiled brat.

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.292
Don't ever forget,

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:46.750
that if not for you,
Mom would still be with us right now.

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:49.958
You make this house unlivable.

00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:02.875
Miss, what happened to your arm?

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:04.833
It's nothing.

00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.333
Here, I've packed your lunch.

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:11.208
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:31.208
Dipta.

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:39.750
Could you give me a ride to school?

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958
My usual ride won't be coming anymore.

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:49.458
Alie,

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.375
you're well aware

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:54.750
that thanks to you,

00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:58.458
my legs don't work well anymore.

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:00.917
I have to limp.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:04.750
What if I gave you a ride,

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:07.792
got into an accident, and died?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.417
All because I gave a ride
to the black sheep of the family.

00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:12.875
Li.

00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:15.750
- You can come with us.
- May I?

00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:19.583
What? Not a chance.
You can walk to school.

00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:21.167
Let's go.

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:06.542
Come on in.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.500
- Sir, wait for me.
- Hurry up.

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:23.792
- Thanks, sir.
- Sure.

00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:30.042
15 YEARS EARLIER

00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:33.833
One, two, three.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.167
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.250
Careful, don't fall down.

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:47.208
- Look, I won.
- Let's have some water.

00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:49.792
Here, drink up.

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.500
You haven't even had a sip of water.

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:56.625
Take it easy. You don't want to choke.

00:06:58.542 --> 00:06:59.542
Hold on.

00:07:03.167 --> 00:07:04.750
- Yes, sir?
- Hello, Gianla.

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:08.167
Tell the kids to come home.
Their mother's arriving soon.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.750
Okay, sir.

00:07:11.042 --> 00:07:12.958
Boys, your mother's home.

00:07:15.042 --> 00:07:20.167
- Catch me if you can!
- Slow down, boys.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.792
So eager to get home, huh?

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.375
CERTIFICATE OF RECOGNITION

00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:30.292
"The Adventures
of the Lion and the Mouse."

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:32.625
The lion and the mouse?

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:34.875
Quiet.

00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.375
Do you want me to read this story or not?

00:07:37.458 --> 00:07:39.375
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:41.500
"The Lion…"

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:43.125
Yes?

00:07:44.417 --> 00:07:45.417
What is it?

00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:47.250
It's for you.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.750
Okay. One second.
I have to take this call.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Hello?

00:07:53.083 --> 00:07:54.083
Yes.

00:07:56.417 --> 00:07:59.875
Miss Gianla, would you read us the story?

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:03.875
Mom only read us the title,
thanks to Enda's interruptions.

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:05.500
It's your fault.

00:08:05.583 --> 00:08:07.750
- It's your fault.
- No, yours.

00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:10.667
- No, it's your fault.
- Come on now, no need to fight.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.542
- Do you want me to read the story?
- Yes, please.

00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:14.625
Lie down then.

00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:16.542
Good.

00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:17.875
Are you comfortable?

00:08:18.542 --> 00:08:19.750
Ready for the story?

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:23.917
"The Adventures
of the Lion and the Mouse."

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:32.125
Can't you stay a bit longer?

00:08:33.208 --> 00:08:35.667
You just got back.
Do you really need to go?

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.917
It's a war-torn country.
Aren't you worried about your safety?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.750
Honey, I have never been
a war correspondent.

00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:46.875
This will be a great opportunity
for my career.

00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:54.750
I know you're worried.

00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:57.625
Relax, I can take care of myself.

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:02.167
I know it's a great opportunity
and everything.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.750
But is this coverage
really more important than the kids?

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:06.917
We have Gianla.

00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.208
She's great with the kids.

00:09:10.292 --> 00:09:13.083
She can even handle
our little ones, Sam and Natta.

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:15.208
I know, but she's just their nanny.

00:09:15.292 --> 00:09:17.958
You're their mother. They need you here.

00:09:26.792 --> 00:09:28.542
The driver will be here soon.

00:09:29.542 --> 00:09:31.500
I'll go say good-bye to the kids.

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:09.708
- Gianla.
- Yes, ma'am?

00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:11.917
I leave them in your care.

00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:15.292
You just need to be patient.

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:16.833
Of course, ma'am.

00:10:18.167 --> 00:10:21.000
And please take care of their father too.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.917
Remind him to eat.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.667
He gets so caught up with work
and misses his meals.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.458
You can count on me.

00:11:17.792 --> 00:11:20.125
We're going to crash.

00:11:21.167 --> 00:11:22.167
Gianla.

00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:28.042
This has been in the fridge for ten days.
Is it still edible?

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:32.583
There should be an expiration date
on the package.

00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:34.625
I see it.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.583
We interrupt this program to bring you
devastating news from a war-torn country.

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:43.625
The reporter covering the war
in Central African Republic…

00:11:43.708 --> 00:11:45.000
Sir.

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:46.208
Look.

00:11:46.292 --> 00:11:49.042
…one of the senior journalists,
Tsana Said,

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.583
has passed away on December 23, 2007.

00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:58.583
Tsana was shot during an attack in Bambari
while reporting on war-affected children.

00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:00.583
Her body is currently being laid to rest

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:03.250
at the Embassy
of the Republic of Indonesia…

00:12:16.542 --> 00:12:20.250
I accept henceforth Gianla Sari,
daughter of Sobarudin Arfan,

00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:22.917
with the dowry agreed upon in cash.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.125
What do the witnesses think?

00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:28.500
- Agreed.
- Praise be to God.

00:12:50.667 --> 00:12:52.583
Alie Ishala Samantha.

00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:59.667
Today, I'm making a video
using new phone Dad bought.

00:13:06.875 --> 00:13:08.292
Hey, Daddy's pet.

00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:11.083
What did you ask for this time?

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:15.250
What a brat. He spoils you too much.

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:18.750
Go ahead. I'll come later
with Samuel and Natta, okay?

00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:24.542
What are they up to now?

00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:25.625
The usual.

00:13:26.458 --> 00:13:28.167
- Later.
- Drive safe.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.090
- Peace be upon you.
- And peace be upon you too.

00:13:30.167 --> 00:13:34.917
- Here, catch this.
- Give it back! Mom!

00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:38.792
What's with all the ruckus?

00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:41.000
She's just a kid.
She doesn't need a phone.

00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:44.792
Don't be jealous of your sister.
We've always treated all of you equally.

00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:47.208
Hear that? Jerks.

00:13:47.917 --> 00:13:49.292
Let's go.

00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.125
- I call shotgun!
- That little brat.

00:13:57.667 --> 00:13:59.125
Let's go.

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:15.917
Hi, everyone.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.125
Today we're going to the supermarket
with my mom.

00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:22.583
Along with Rendra and Dipta.

00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:23.958
Hi, Rendra.

00:14:24.542 --> 00:14:27.000
- Rendra, look here.
- Stop that.

00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:29.500
- Rendra, just a second.
- No.

00:14:29.583 --> 00:14:33.583
Alie, if your brother doesn't want to,
don't force him. It's rude.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.250
Listen to her.

00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:37.083
But it won't take long, Mom.

00:14:37.583 --> 00:14:39.417
Fine, I'll just ask Dipta.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.833
Hi, Dipta. Dipta, say hi, please.

00:14:41.917 --> 00:14:44.750
- Knock it off.
- Alie, don't do that, honey.

00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.167
Let's go to Mom.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.792
Have you seen her?

00:14:48.875 --> 00:14:49.958
This is my mom.

00:14:50.042 --> 00:14:54.417
- Mrs. Gianla, hi!
- Hi, Miss Li!

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.667
Mom, look here.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.375
- Mom, look here for a second.
- I'm driving, sweetie.

00:14:58.458 --> 00:15:00.750
It won't take long, just look this way.

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.667
- It's dangerous.
- It's not.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.250
- Mom, come on.
- All right, after this turn.

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:07.958
It won't take long, Mom. Come on.

00:15:08.042 --> 00:15:09.417
- Yes, hi.
- Hi!

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.667
Where are we going?

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.750
We're going to the supermarket today.

00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:16.792
We're going to buy...

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:18.083
Mom, watch out!

00:15:52.542 --> 00:15:53.667
Peace be upon you.

00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:01.375
Dad?

00:16:39.583 --> 00:16:40.583
Alie?

00:16:42.625 --> 00:16:44.167
- Alie!
- Yes?

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.917
Where's the watch Mom gave me?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.375
Miss Imah said you took it.

00:16:54.917 --> 00:16:56.042
I cleaned it.

00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:58.333
- It was dirty.
- Keep your hands off it.

00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:00.333
Remember this.

00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:03.750
Never touch my stuff ever again.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.917
Especially the things Mom gave me.

00:17:08.417 --> 00:17:12.958
I don't want my stuff to be touched
by the person who killed her.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.125
Got an exam today?

00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:08.708
I had one yesterday.

00:18:09.333 --> 00:18:12.542
- You got any today?
- Yeah, math.

00:18:13.208 --> 00:18:14.208
Good luck.

00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.000
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Alie.

00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:22.750
I'll see you later.

00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:31.708
Why do you talk to her?

00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:36.083
Don't be silly, we have to.
We live under the same roof.

00:18:36.167 --> 00:18:37.625
- It's stupid.
- Whatever.

00:18:37.708 --> 00:18:40.542
She ruined our morning already.
Got us bickering.

00:18:41.833 --> 00:18:43.042
You're driving, Ren?

00:18:43.833 --> 00:18:44.833
Yeah.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.042
Dad's still asleep.
Doesn't seem like he'll go out.

00:18:52.042 --> 00:18:53.542
I'll go start the car.

00:18:55.125 --> 00:18:56.708
I'll only wait for five minutes.

00:18:56.792 --> 00:18:59.708
- If you guys don't show up, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:03.208
I feel bad for Dad.

00:19:03.292 --> 00:19:05.125
He's always at home these days

00:19:05.208 --> 00:19:08.292
because his advertising company
is going under.

00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:09.958
He went bankrupt because of Alie.

00:19:10.042 --> 00:19:11.708
You can't keep blaming her.

00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:13.917
What? Am I wrong?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.375
That's the truth.

00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:17.083
Since the day she was born,

00:19:17.167 --> 00:19:20.125
she's brought nothing but misfortune
on our family.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.375
Whatever. We're running late.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.708
- Stay safe, Sam.
- Yeah.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.542
Dad?

00:19:51.292 --> 00:19:52.750
Dad, we're leaving.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.458
All good.

00:20:11.542 --> 00:20:12.625
Good luck.

00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:27.750
Let's find another one.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.250
Hi, Nat.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Hi.

00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:32.708
For you.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Thank you.

00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:40.125
Alright. Let's go over there.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:41.750
Bye.

00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:58.500
Li, let's form a group.

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:00.167
We need one more person.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.875
You're right.

00:21:04.417 --> 00:21:06.458
- Hey, Aji.
- What do you want?

00:21:07.042 --> 00:21:09.042
- Do you have a group yet?
- Not yet.

00:21:09.125 --> 00:21:10.250
Come join us then.

00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:11.958
Sure.

00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:15.167
But you'll have to solve my riddle.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.750
Okay?

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.833
What cow sticks on the wall?

00:21:24.708 --> 00:21:25.625
Spider-cow?

00:21:25.708 --> 00:21:26.708
Wrong.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.500
Cow sticker?

00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:30.167
Nice. She's correct.

00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:32.083
Yes.

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:35.167
- All right, but we'll be a group, right?
- Yeah.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.792
Okay, we'll work on it at my house.
What do you think?

00:21:37.875 --> 00:21:38.875
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.750
Found it.

00:21:45.417 --> 00:21:49.750
The difference between
"everyday" and "every day."

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:51.625
Listen closely.

00:21:53.583 --> 00:21:57.792
Okay. "'Everyday, ' written as one word,

00:21:57.875 --> 00:22:00.833
is used to modify adjacent words."

00:22:00.917 --> 00:22:04.250
"As for 'every day, '

00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:05.833
two words,

00:22:05.917 --> 00:22:09.500
is used to demonstrate
something that happens every single day."

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.625
House and home.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:18.667
"A house refers to
the physical buildings of a habitation."

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.958
"Whereas 'home' refers to the emotional
attachments to the habitation."

00:22:24.583 --> 00:22:25.583
Wait a minute.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.083
"Emotional attachments."

00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:30.583
What does that mean?

00:22:30.667 --> 00:22:31.708
I don't get it.

00:22:31.792 --> 00:22:35.125
Maybe it's like,
you live in your house, right?

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.792
Do you feel comfortable there?

00:22:38.583 --> 00:22:40.500
Do you feel safe there?

00:22:41.083 --> 00:22:44.542
Does it make you want to hurry home?

00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:46.583
It does, yeah.

00:22:46.667 --> 00:22:49.750
When I'm away from home,
I don't feel so comfortable.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.625
I think there's a term for it.

00:22:52.708 --> 00:22:54.625
- Is it "homesick"?
- Correct.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.500
Li? Hey.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.500
Hey.

00:23:04.875 --> 00:23:07.208
- You're spacing out.
- Sorry.

00:23:07.292 --> 00:23:08.292
Write it down.

00:23:15.375 --> 00:23:17.792
You don't have to, Ji.
It's too much of a distance.

00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:18.917
It's fine, Li.

00:23:19.833 --> 00:23:21.792
I always give people a ride.

00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:24.375
My mom, dad, cousins, friends.

00:23:24.458 --> 00:23:25.583
Everyone, Li.

00:23:25.667 --> 00:23:27.875
But you only brought one helmet, Aji.

00:23:27.958 --> 00:23:30.875
It's okay. I'll go slow.

00:23:30.958 --> 00:23:31.958
She's safe with me.

00:23:34.042 --> 00:23:35.792
I don't want to get into trouble.

00:23:35.875 --> 00:23:36.875
Why?

00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:40.542
Are you afraid I'll find out
you're Samuel and Natta's sister?

00:23:40.625 --> 00:23:41.625
Huh?

00:23:42.292 --> 00:23:44.708
Their sister? You're making things up.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.500
Don't worry, Sel. I won't tell anyone.

00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:50.708
What's wrong, Li?

00:23:50.792 --> 00:23:53.208
Wondering how I know about that?

00:23:55.625 --> 00:23:58.583
I've known it since we were freshmen.

00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:02.917
Who put that brat in this school?

00:24:04.833 --> 00:24:07.167
"Alie." Her name is Alie, Sam.

00:24:08.458 --> 00:24:10.375
I'll call her whatever I want.

00:24:10.458 --> 00:24:14.917
Look, if the whole school finds out
she's our sister, we're done.

00:24:32.542 --> 00:24:36.667
Li, I promise I won't tell anyone.

00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:40.375
- You promise, Ji?
- Yes, Li, I promise.

00:24:40.458 --> 00:24:42.250
We're friends now, right?

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.417
What's a ship that can't sink?

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.000
It's getting late.
Save it for another time.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.833
The answer's "friendship."

00:24:55.208 --> 00:24:56.250
Get on, Li.

00:24:57.458 --> 00:24:58.458
Need help?

00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:02.750
Mr. Supri, please open the gate.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.917
- Bye, Sel.
- Thanks, Sel.

00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:07.125
- Take care.
- Bye.

00:25:09.042 --> 00:25:11.083
So they rejected the proposal.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.250
I don't care.
It's your job to clean up the mess.

00:25:16.333 --> 00:25:19.000
Get them to approve it.
Get the budget under control.

00:25:20.708 --> 00:25:21.708
Okay.

00:25:28.417 --> 00:25:29.792
The black fence.

00:25:29.875 --> 00:25:31.083
- Where?
- Right there.

00:25:31.167 --> 00:25:32.167
Okay, I see it.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.042
Okay.

00:25:41.417 --> 00:25:43.125
- Need help?
- I'm good.

00:25:43.917 --> 00:25:45.667
- Thanks, Ji.
- Anytime, Li.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.500
- Get home safe.
- Bye.

00:25:58.042 --> 00:25:59.208
Peace be upon you.

00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:02.875
Dad, I'm sorry…

00:26:05.667 --> 00:26:06.667
How dare you!

00:26:08.917 --> 00:26:10.667
How dare you come home this late.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.000
You let a boy give you a ride?
Just the two of you?

00:26:14.083 --> 00:26:16.417
- That's unacceptable.
- I'm sorry, but...

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.875
Alie, don't you dare talk back to me!

00:26:21.667 --> 00:26:23.375
You ill-behaved child!

00:26:24.292 --> 00:26:26.250
Get up.

00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:29.333
What's going on out there?

00:26:29.417 --> 00:26:30.583
No, Dad. I'm sorry!

00:26:30.667 --> 00:26:32.375
What a racket.

00:26:32.458 --> 00:26:34.333
You're always causing problems!

00:26:34.417 --> 00:26:35.875
Get in there!

00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:39.083
- Come on.
- No, Dad, please!

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.292
Dad, no!

00:26:42.375 --> 00:26:45.833
You little delinquent!
You have no respect for my rules!

00:26:46.542 --> 00:26:50.458
As long as you live in this house,
you'll follow my rules.

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:51.667
Do you understand?!

00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:53.667
Do you?

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:56.875
Ungrateful bastard!

00:27:37.958 --> 00:27:38.958
Li.

00:28:09.958 --> 00:28:11.500
Hang in there, Alie.

00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:15.833
You need to stay strong and healthy.

00:28:17.542 --> 00:28:19.250
You'll get through this.

00:28:20.792 --> 00:28:21.875
You got this.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.708
Miss Imah, where's my sweater?

00:29:17.792 --> 00:29:19.000
What did you say?

00:29:19.083 --> 00:29:20.292
Where's my sweater?

00:29:20.375 --> 00:29:22.833
- I've ironed it. It's in your room.
- Is it?

00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:24.875
Where are you going?

00:29:26.542 --> 00:29:27.667
We're eating out.

00:29:28.167 --> 00:29:29.917
Then paying our moms a visit.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.208
Miss Imah and I
are planning to make rib soup.

00:29:33.125 --> 00:29:34.458
So?

00:29:34.542 --> 00:29:36.208
Don't tell us what to do.

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:38.375
Can I come?

00:29:40.542 --> 00:29:41.750
Dipta, can I come?

00:29:45.375 --> 00:29:46.375
Li.

00:29:51.875 --> 00:29:53.667
You'll only ruin the mood.

00:29:54.708 --> 00:29:56.042
You ruin everything.

00:29:56.917 --> 00:29:59.042
You have ruined our lives.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.500
You have ruined my life.

00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:07.125
- But...
- Shut up!

00:30:07.833 --> 00:30:09.583
What could you possibly have to say?

00:30:12.083 --> 00:30:13.542
You never listen to me!

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.250
Mom…

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:10.167
Is it fun up there in your new home?

00:32:16.208 --> 00:32:20.375
It's getting more and more uncomfortable
down here at Dad's.

00:32:25.375 --> 00:32:27.375
Everyone hates me even more.

00:32:34.208 --> 00:32:35.417
I know that

00:32:36.583 --> 00:32:40.000
it's my fault that you left us.

00:32:44.917 --> 00:32:47.167
I never meant for you to go.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:51.042
I'm devastated too that you had to go.

00:33:03.292 --> 00:33:04.708
Mom, please protect me.

00:33:07.125 --> 00:33:08.958
Please tell them

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.000
to stop yelling at me.

00:33:37.958 --> 00:33:40.042
I can't believe Miss Imah quit.

00:33:41.083 --> 00:33:42.750
Maybe she got a better job.

00:33:43.667 --> 00:33:45.125
Damn it.

00:33:45.208 --> 00:33:47.167
Who's gonna make our breakfast now?

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.958
She's no longer with us because
Dad can't afford to pay her anymore.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Alie.

00:34:00.792 --> 00:34:02.000
Come here.

00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:05.792
Yes?

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.875
Here's a list of chores…

00:34:11.125 --> 00:34:13.708
You'll need to do in Miss Imah's place.

00:34:16.375 --> 00:34:18.625
I thought it was something important.

00:34:18.708 --> 00:34:20.208
She'll replace Miss Imah.

00:34:22.875 --> 00:34:24.250
Sure, I'll do it later.

00:34:24.792 --> 00:34:25.875
I'm leaving.

00:34:32.958 --> 00:34:34.667
Why do you care about her?

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.167
She's still Dad's child, after all.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.292
She has a right to be in this car too.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.500
Stop.

00:34:42.208 --> 00:34:43.708
Okay. Fine.

00:34:43.792 --> 00:34:44.792
Back up.

00:34:48.167 --> 00:34:49.167
Alie!

00:34:50.167 --> 00:34:51.167
Li!

00:34:51.875 --> 00:34:52.875
Get in, hurry.

00:34:59.375 --> 00:35:00.792
- May I?
- Yes.

00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:29.375
Thanks for the ride.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.875
Cheese!

00:35:33.958 --> 00:35:35.083
Hey, who is that?

00:35:35.875 --> 00:35:38.500
Why is she in the same car
as your crush, Natta?

00:35:38.583 --> 00:35:39.833
Who are you talking about?

00:35:39.917 --> 00:35:42.000
The kid with the blue cardigan.

00:35:43.292 --> 00:35:45.250
That's Alie from Year 10.

00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:47.458
Forget it, she's a nobody.

00:35:47.542 --> 00:35:50.292
But it's odd that she rode in Natta's car.

00:35:50.875 --> 00:35:52.208
She'll pay for this.

00:35:52.292 --> 00:35:54.625
I'll make sure she stays away from him.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.792
Alie Ishala Samantha.

00:36:22.875 --> 00:36:26.208
I'm fed up with your little stunts.

00:36:28.458 --> 00:36:33.125
All this time you flirted with him,
I just let it slide.

00:36:34.417 --> 00:36:37.667
And just this morning,
you were in the same car as him?

00:36:38.917 --> 00:36:40.583
I'll put you in your place.

00:36:41.125 --> 00:36:45.000
- What are you talking about?
- What do you think I'm talking about?

00:36:45.667 --> 00:36:46.875
You think I didn't know?

00:36:46.958 --> 00:36:50.417
You waved to Natta
from outside your classroom.

00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:52.833
What are you trying to do?

00:36:54.042 --> 00:36:55.042
- I…
- What?

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.208
I'm warning you.

00:36:59.292 --> 00:37:02.000
Stop flirting with Natta…

00:37:03.917 --> 00:37:05.542
Or you'll be sorry you did.

00:37:06.542 --> 00:37:07.833
I'm not scared of you.

00:37:07.917 --> 00:37:10.042
You don't get to tell me what to do.

00:37:11.375 --> 00:37:12.458
Come here, you!

00:37:18.167 --> 00:37:19.167
Do it.

00:37:33.917 --> 00:37:35.125
Let's go.

00:37:50.708 --> 00:37:52.583
Stop!

00:37:52.667 --> 00:37:56.167
Come on. Back up.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:57.250
Alie?

00:37:57.792 --> 00:37:59.333
Li, what are you doing?

00:38:00.417 --> 00:38:01.500
Is that you, Aji?

00:38:07.458 --> 00:38:08.833
What are you doing, Li?

00:38:08.917 --> 00:38:10.375
I'm waiting for Natta.

00:38:10.458 --> 00:38:12.625
What? Just get on my bike already.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.625
No, Ji, thanks.

00:38:14.708 --> 00:38:16.333
Li, it's pouring out here.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.583
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:25.375
All right?

00:38:27.125 --> 00:38:28.875
- Ready?
- Yeah.

00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:42.167
Aji, just drop me off here.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.833
- Right here?
- Yes, I'll be fine.

00:38:43.917 --> 00:38:45.750
- We're not there yet.
- It's okay.

00:38:47.833 --> 00:38:49.542
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Thanks, Ji.

00:38:49.625 --> 00:38:51.500
- Take care.
- You too, Li.

00:39:10.125 --> 00:39:11.667
- Peace be upon you.
- Alie.

00:39:14.417 --> 00:39:17.500
You're disrespectful.
You don't listen to us anymore.

00:39:18.292 --> 00:39:19.292
Right?

00:39:20.125 --> 00:39:21.250
Sorry.

00:39:21.833 --> 00:39:23.208
I'll go change.

00:39:24.292 --> 00:39:26.208
Hey! I'm not done talking!

00:39:28.917 --> 00:39:30.458
Did I say you could leave?

00:39:31.667 --> 00:39:33.625
You have no shame at all.

00:39:34.375 --> 00:39:36.833
You came home with a guy, Alie.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.125
What kind of girl are you?

00:39:39.917 --> 00:39:42.583
What will become of you?

00:39:45.042 --> 00:39:47.667
Dad was right.
You're an ungrateful bastard.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:49.667
- You're a burden...
- Stop!

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:56.042
It's my fault. I was late to pick her up.

00:39:56.125 --> 00:39:59.042
If you have to hit somebody,
hit me, not her.

00:40:00.375 --> 00:40:01.750
You're just like her.

00:40:12.375 --> 00:40:13.375
Li.

00:40:14.167 --> 00:40:16.000
- I'm sorry...
- It's my fault.

00:40:17.542 --> 00:40:19.500
I should've just waited for you.

00:40:41.708 --> 00:40:42.708
Hi, Li.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.833
Li, got something on your mind?

00:40:46.333 --> 00:40:47.500
Don't bottle it up.

00:40:56.167 --> 00:40:57.167
Li.

00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:03.333
Li?

00:41:06.708 --> 00:41:08.750
Li, what's the matter?

00:41:10.625 --> 00:41:11.750
You can tell me.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.875
I know we've only just become friends,

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.667
but that doesn't mean you can't trust me.

00:41:29.708 --> 00:41:31.208
I can be your safe space,

00:41:31.708 --> 00:41:33.375
someone for you to talk to.

00:41:38.583 --> 00:41:39.583
Li,

00:41:40.417 --> 00:41:41.417
please.

00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:43.500
Tell me what's going on.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.458
I've never asked
why you've had a bandage on your forehead,

00:41:51.042 --> 00:41:53.125
or why your cheeks are bruised.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.833
But that doesn't mean I don't care, Li.

00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:09.958
My brother hit me.

00:42:12.625 --> 00:42:13.625
Your brother?

00:42:14.417 --> 00:42:16.375
Samuel? Natta?

00:42:17.708 --> 00:42:18.792
Dipta.

00:42:23.417 --> 00:42:25.583
- Li…
- Can I hug you, Sel?

00:42:27.042 --> 00:42:28.042
Of course.

00:43:07.708 --> 00:43:09.542
Hear me out, Mr. Baim.

00:43:09.625 --> 00:43:13.750
What if you invested at 25% in advance?

00:43:13.833 --> 00:43:17.750
I'll find another investor for the rest.
What do you think?

00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:22.875
My profits are going to be delayed
if you have to find three more investors.

00:43:26.875 --> 00:43:31.000
Okay, I understand.
Let me consult with my team first.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:34.292
Thank you.

00:43:54.583 --> 00:43:56.208
- Dad.
- Go away.

00:43:57.542 --> 00:44:00.083
I just wanted to ask about dinner.

00:44:00.167 --> 00:44:02.875
Do you want me to cook
or would you rather order in?

00:44:02.958 --> 00:44:04.167
I said go away.

00:44:06.792 --> 00:44:13.250
If only you didn't have to make
your dumb little video that day,

00:44:14.125 --> 00:44:17.417
Gianla would still be here with me.

00:44:22.083 --> 00:44:23.083
You know what?

00:44:25.625 --> 00:44:27.875
Ever since Gianla passed away,

00:44:28.625 --> 00:44:31.125
everything that I had is gone.

00:44:31.208 --> 00:44:35.875
My business, my career which I had built
with such painstaking effort, all gone.

00:44:37.458 --> 00:44:39.625
There's no more hope to hold on to.

00:44:41.125 --> 00:44:42.208
My life is over.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:55.292
Now answer me.

00:44:58.833 --> 00:45:01.167
Why must all of this happen to me?

00:45:02.292 --> 00:45:03.958
Why must Gianla…

00:45:08.792 --> 00:45:09.792
Why…

00:45:11.833 --> 00:45:13.458
Why did Gianla have to die?

00:45:18.333 --> 00:45:19.333
Answer me.

00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:23.333
Go on.

00:45:25.875 --> 00:45:27.167
Answer me!

00:45:30.042 --> 00:45:31.708
All you bring is misfortune.

00:46:07.208 --> 00:46:09.583
Who got you smiling like that?

00:46:12.167 --> 00:46:13.708
Hey, where are you going?

00:46:20.167 --> 00:46:21.458
Are you eating meatballs?

00:46:21.542 --> 00:46:24.042
Must be nice.

00:46:24.125 --> 00:46:25.375
Have a taste.

00:46:27.375 --> 00:46:28.958
I think it's missing my touch.

00:46:29.042 --> 00:46:30.042
Yeah.

00:46:39.125 --> 00:46:40.125
Wow!

00:46:41.083 --> 00:46:42.083
How is it?

00:46:42.625 --> 00:46:43.833
Try it.

00:46:44.625 --> 00:46:47.125
Tastes the same as before.
I think it needs more.

00:46:47.208 --> 00:46:48.208
Yeah.

00:46:52.792 --> 00:46:54.500
That looks so fresh.

00:46:55.292 --> 00:46:56.833
It's almost tempting.

00:46:57.417 --> 00:47:00.083
You should try it. What do you say?

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Go on, eat.

00:47:15.958 --> 00:47:17.708
It's good, isn't it?

00:47:20.083 --> 00:47:21.625
Why did you stop?

00:47:22.417 --> 00:47:23.417
Dig in.

00:47:24.542 --> 00:47:26.833
It's a shame to waste food.

00:47:27.417 --> 00:47:28.792
Eat it, or else…

00:47:42.375 --> 00:47:46.125
Ew, gross! She's eating her snot.

00:47:46.208 --> 00:47:48.792
Ew!

00:47:49.417 --> 00:47:52.708
She's just very moved
by your cooking skills.

00:47:52.792 --> 00:47:55.375
Obviously. I'm such a good cook.

00:47:56.125 --> 00:47:57.125
Right?

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Oops.

00:48:00.625 --> 00:48:02.833
How awful. You spilled it.

00:48:02.917 --> 00:48:05.542
Sorry about that.
She didn't mean to do that.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.292
Hi, girls. What are you up to?

00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:11.667
Time to go.

00:48:12.083 --> 00:48:13.875
Her knight has arrived.

00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:16.042
Hey, you know what? I have a riddle.

00:48:16.125 --> 00:48:17.125
Let me hear it.

00:48:17.792 --> 00:48:20.583
What do you call meatballs that can swim?

00:48:20.667 --> 00:48:22.417
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:48:23.167 --> 00:48:24.667
- Fish meatballs.
- Correct.

00:48:25.208 --> 00:48:26.208
Fish meatballs.

00:48:31.667 --> 00:48:33.917
Li, are they bullying you?

00:48:35.375 --> 00:48:37.083
No, they were just sitting with me.

00:48:37.167 --> 00:48:39.250
I know they're a bunch of bullies.

00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:41.667
Especially the leader, Nazwa.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.417
She's a spoiled rich kid.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.167
She gets away with everything.

00:48:46.375 --> 00:48:47.667
I'm going to get a drink.

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.958
- Let me get it for you.
- No, I got it.

00:48:51.167 --> 00:48:52.167
Guys.

00:48:56.792 --> 00:48:57.625
Oops.

00:48:57.708 --> 00:48:59.375
Alie! Li!

00:49:00.042 --> 00:49:01.583
Li, are you okay?

00:49:07.833 --> 00:49:10.125
What a drama queen.

00:49:11.667 --> 00:49:14.083
Right? She thinks she's a princess.

00:49:25.958 --> 00:49:27.625
You should get to class.

00:49:27.708 --> 00:49:28.875
What about you?

00:49:28.958 --> 00:49:30.583
Don't worry, I'll catch up.

00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:33.583
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I can patch myself up.

00:49:33.667 --> 00:49:35.542
I'll let the teacher know then.

00:49:35.625 --> 00:49:37.167
- Sorry, Li.
- It's okay, Ji.

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:38.667
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:49:58.417 --> 00:49:59.625
- Natta.
- Li.

00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:02.333
Let me help you.

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.458
Does it hurt? Sorry.

00:50:13.917 --> 00:50:14.958
Thank you.

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:18.000
It's nothing, Li.

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:22.708
I should be the one apologizing.

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.667
I should be defending you.

00:50:29.375 --> 00:50:32.625
But you know how it is
with those people in the canteen.

00:50:33.417 --> 00:50:34.417
Too many eyes.

00:50:35.667 --> 00:50:37.250
I'd just make it worse.

00:50:41.958 --> 00:50:45.083
I thought you didn't want
to talk to me at school.

00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:46.667
No.

00:50:47.958 --> 00:50:49.292
I'm your brother after all.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Come in.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.458
Sorry I'm late, sir.

00:51:09.542 --> 00:51:12.375
That's okay. Join Laura over there.

00:51:12.958 --> 00:51:13.958
Thank you, sir.

00:51:19.458 --> 00:51:22.167
Li, plug the cable in there, okay?

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.250
Okay.

00:51:30.958 --> 00:51:33.125
Everyone, get out of the room!

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:38.083
Fire!

00:51:39.292 --> 00:51:41.458
Hurry, get out of here!

00:51:41.542 --> 00:51:43.167
- It's my fault.
- Li.

00:51:43.833 --> 00:51:46.083
- It's my fault.
- No, it's not.

00:51:46.167 --> 00:51:48.167
- It's my fault.
- It was an accident, Li.

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:50.042
- It was me.
- It's not your fault.

00:51:50.125 --> 00:51:52.167
You just got here. It was an accident.

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.417
But it's my fault that I came late and...

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:57.417
No. Calm yourself down.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:58.875
Calm down, okay?

00:52:16.625 --> 00:52:17.833
Bastard!

00:52:18.625 --> 00:52:22.292
None of my boys have ever caused
any problems at school.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.458
But you.

00:52:25.167 --> 00:52:27.333
You always make such a mess!

00:52:27.417 --> 00:52:31.792
Now I'll have to pay damages
for the lab you burned down.

00:52:31.875 --> 00:52:33.792
I'm sorry, Dad, I promise I'll...

00:52:33.875 --> 00:52:35.750
I don't need your apologies!

00:52:35.833 --> 00:52:37.875
I don't need your empty promises.

00:52:40.417 --> 00:52:42.250
I've tried to accept you.

00:52:42.333 --> 00:52:46.125
I've tried working hard for you,
but what do I get?

00:52:46.208 --> 00:52:47.292
What do I get?!

00:52:48.375 --> 00:52:50.625
You just keep making my life miserable!

00:52:52.125 --> 00:52:56.208
- You ungrateful child. Come here!
- Dad, no!

00:52:56.292 --> 00:52:59.333
- I said come here!
- Dad, please don't!

00:53:00.542 --> 00:53:01.542
Come here.

00:53:01.917 --> 00:53:04.042
Shut up!

00:53:05.792 --> 00:53:08.083
Get in there. Get in.

00:53:08.708 --> 00:53:10.167
Now stay put!

00:53:11.542 --> 00:53:13.792
You don't deserve to live in my house.

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:18.042
Better that I get rid of you
to avoid more misfortune.

00:53:19.083 --> 00:53:20.083
Stay right here.

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:27.042
You're nothing but a burden on me!

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:49.792
Hey, where are you going?

00:53:49.875 --> 00:53:51.875
- Dad told me to get him cigarettes.
- Oh.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.875
- Is Alie in her room?
- No, in the storage shed.

00:53:54.958 --> 00:53:56.417
What? The storage shed?

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.167
She's being grounded.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.500
- You didn't help her?
- Why would I help her?

00:54:01.583 --> 00:54:03.542
Sam, it's filthy in there.

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.542
It's stinky and dark.

00:54:06.042 --> 00:54:07.958
She's hurt her leg too, you know that.

00:54:08.042 --> 00:54:10.750
- That's not my problem.
- Well, it should be!

00:54:10.833 --> 00:54:12.583
You're heartless.

00:54:12.667 --> 00:54:14.500
Why are you blaming me?

00:54:15.333 --> 00:54:16.542
What the heck?

00:54:43.458 --> 00:54:45.083
You're not the problem, Li.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.708
This house feels suffocating
with all the anger directed at you.

00:55:10.833 --> 00:55:11.958
You know…

00:55:14.875 --> 00:55:16.333
Ever since Mom died…

00:55:20.833 --> 00:55:22.083
Our family has been

00:55:23.292 --> 00:55:24.458
so quick to anger.

00:55:30.167 --> 00:55:31.250
Dad's business…

00:55:33.167 --> 00:55:34.167
Went under.

00:55:38.708 --> 00:55:40.292
He's an alcoholic now.

00:55:48.208 --> 00:55:50.000
They were all frustrated.

00:55:53.625 --> 00:55:55.750
Eventually they became ill-tempered.

00:56:08.458 --> 00:56:09.542
I know.

00:56:13.583 --> 00:56:15.375
This is all my fault.

00:56:21.292 --> 00:56:23.667
If I hadn't wanted to record that video…

00:56:25.792 --> 00:56:27.750
Mom would still be here today.

00:56:41.667 --> 00:56:42.667
Come on.

00:56:45.042 --> 00:56:46.125
Go take a shower.

00:57:05.625 --> 00:57:06.708
Thank you.

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:10.542
For talking to me.

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:13.833
For helping me.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.500
No problem.

00:57:47.167 --> 00:57:48.167
Hey, Mom.

00:57:52.917 --> 00:57:56.000
Dad locked me up
in the storage shed yesterday.

00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:03.250
Because he has to pay damages
to the school.

00:58:07.958 --> 00:58:09.167
Because of me.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.125
Then he told me

00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:21.458
that I've always brought
nothing but misfortune to him.

00:58:28.708 --> 00:58:30.125
That makes me sad.

01:00:14.875 --> 01:00:16.792
Be careful next time, all right?

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.250
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:26.083
Take a look at this.

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.542
- Is that Alie?
- Yeah.

01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:36.250
- What the heck is she doing?
- No idea.

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:37.917
Let's go home.

01:00:48.542 --> 01:00:49.875
What's wrong with you?

01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:54.417
Now you feel guilty
for trying to kill yourself in public?

01:00:56.333 --> 01:00:59.875
Do you realize how shameful
this could be for our family?

01:01:01.917 --> 01:01:04.875
Are you proud your video went viral?
Is that what you wanted?

01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:07.125
Alie, look at me.

01:01:09.042 --> 01:01:12.250
Dad won't know about this
because we'll cover it up.

01:01:12.917 --> 01:01:15.708
But if he finds out somehow,
you're finished.

01:01:43.625 --> 01:01:45.000
Get out of my way.

01:01:50.917 --> 01:01:51.917
Li.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:53.667
Come with us.

01:01:58.083 --> 01:01:59.083
Let's go.

01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:12.708
Good morning.

01:02:16.958 --> 01:02:18.042
Why is she here?

01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:29.625
Li, you should try
to kill yourself every day.

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:31.833
Maybe then we'll pity you.

01:03:01.042 --> 01:03:02.292
You rode with Natta again?

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:04.750
Didn't you?

01:03:06.708 --> 01:03:08.375
I've told you so many times.

01:03:09.667 --> 01:03:11.500
I've told you so many times

01:03:12.333 --> 01:03:13.958
to stay away from Natta.

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:17.083
Did I not make myself clear?

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:21.167
What do you give him
in return for riding in his car?

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:25.458
I saw a video of a girl trying
to kill herself on the train tracks.

01:03:25.542 --> 01:03:26.542
I think that's her.

01:03:26.625 --> 01:03:28.667
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:29.958
What an loser.

01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:32.750
It's just an elaborate ruse
to get attention.

01:03:32.833 --> 01:03:34.542
Typical of a maid's child.

01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:36.708
She's stupid, just like her mother.

01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:40.000
What is it?
Surprised we know about your mother?

01:03:40.667 --> 01:03:43.167
We know you live
in the same house as Natta.

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:45.208
Don't underestimate our network.

01:03:50.083 --> 01:03:51.458
I know everything.

01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:55.375
I wonder…

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:59.583
Maybe you're the illegitimate child
of the family.

01:03:59.667 --> 01:04:02.750
Your mother seduced Natta's dad
so you could have a good life,

01:04:02.833 --> 01:04:04.750
but they end up abandoning you.

01:04:04.833 --> 01:04:06.417
Hence the suicide attempt.

01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:09.667
- Don't talk about my mother.
- Why not?

01:04:10.167 --> 01:04:12.042
You got a problem with that?

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:14.833
Your mother was that terrible, huh?

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:20.042
She failed to raise you right,
so Natta's dad got sick of you.

01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:21.917
Leave my mom out of this.

01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:25.458
You don't deserve to talk about her.

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:28.958
The audacity!

01:04:30.708 --> 01:04:32.542
Don't get cheeky with me.

01:04:33.208 --> 01:04:34.208
You hear me?

01:04:36.167 --> 01:04:38.292
- You're coming with me.
- No!

01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:41.792
Ouch!

01:04:44.833 --> 01:04:45.833
Alie.

01:04:51.083 --> 01:04:52.625
Nazwa, are you okay?

01:05:06.083 --> 01:05:08.292
- What are you looking at?
- Sel, come on.

01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:09.458
Bunch of gossips!

01:05:09.542 --> 01:05:11.333
What's her problem?

01:05:11.417 --> 01:05:13.500
You can see it for yourself in the video.

01:05:14.042 --> 01:05:15.417
That's clear evidence.

01:05:15.917 --> 01:05:19.333
Alie deliberately pushed and hurt me.

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:23.250
And now I have to suffer this pain.

01:05:23.333 --> 01:05:25.667
That's right, ma'am. I saw it.

01:05:26.208 --> 01:05:29.000
You've been causing
all sorts of trouble lately.

01:05:29.542 --> 01:05:32.333
Wasn't that you
who started the fire in the lab?

01:05:32.833 --> 01:05:36.042
Not to mention
the rumor about your suicide attempt.

01:05:36.708 --> 01:05:39.167
Now you injured Nazwa.

01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:42.875
Ma'am, I pushed her by accident.

01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:45.000
She squeezed my arm first, it was painful.

01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:47.000
I was just trying to break free.

01:05:47.583 --> 01:05:49.000
That's right, ma'am.

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:52.500
How could a Year 10 fight a Year 12?

01:05:52.583 --> 01:05:53.708
Think about it.

01:05:53.792 --> 01:05:55.833
Were you there when it happened?

01:05:56.667 --> 01:05:57.667
Were you?

01:05:58.958 --> 01:06:01.125
If not, then don't butt in.

01:06:01.208 --> 01:06:02.750
They edited the video, ma'am.

01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:06.500
They removed the audio
where they insulted my mother.

01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:08.750
Alie, the video is clear as day.

01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:10.250
This proof is absolute.

01:06:10.958 --> 01:06:12.625
You can't deny it.

01:06:13.167 --> 01:06:14.375
She's a bully too.

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:17.208
- There's no way, Sam.
- Just look.

01:06:17.875 --> 01:06:18.875
See that?

01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:22.667
She's getting violent now.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.708
I'm going to ask your parents
to come here tomorrow.

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:29.625
Hopefully this can be a valuable lesson

01:06:29.708 --> 01:06:33.208
so that you grow into a better person
and stop bullying people.

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:36.375
Aji and I know you didn't do it.

01:06:36.458 --> 01:06:37.625
Yeah, Li.

01:06:37.708 --> 01:06:39.167
But they don't, Sel.

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:42.792
I feel like I'm cornered.
I just wanted to defend my mom.

01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:45.167
I know. We'll sort this out, okay?

01:06:45.667 --> 01:06:48.042
But they're going to tell my dad, Sel.

01:06:56.542 --> 01:06:58.917
Li. Did you really hurt someone?

01:07:00.958 --> 01:07:02.417
No, I didn't.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.167
- She was...
- We saw the video.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.917
Li, I've always been on your side.

01:07:10.042 --> 01:07:11.542
Is this how you repay me?

01:07:15.167 --> 01:07:17.125
I never taught you to be a bully.

01:07:17.917 --> 01:07:18.917
Never.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.167
So why would you do something like this?

01:07:23.667 --> 01:07:24.667
Natta...

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:26.625
There's no use denying it.

01:07:27.417 --> 01:07:29.750
You're a bully, just admit it.

01:07:30.958 --> 01:07:32.875
Do you realize what you did?

01:07:32.958 --> 01:07:35.542
Try using your brain
and sympathize with your victim.

01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:38.125
Do you use your brain at all?

01:07:38.208 --> 01:07:39.292
Hold on.

01:07:46.083 --> 01:07:48.500
Use your brain.

01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:51.458
You two should use your brains
before yelling at me.

01:07:52.667 --> 01:07:54.042
I didn't bully anybody.

01:07:55.208 --> 01:07:56.667
I was just defending myself.

01:07:57.917 --> 01:08:00.583
You have no idea what they put me through.

01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:03.792
Nonsense. Do you think
we'll fall for your lies?

01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:07.083
You clearly did it. It's all on video.
Don't try to deny it.

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:08.875
You never believed me anyway.

01:08:10.833 --> 01:08:11.833
Whatever.

01:08:13.042 --> 01:08:14.042
Li.

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.542
Let her go.

01:09:05.042 --> 01:09:07.542
What's the matter now, Alie?

01:09:08.375 --> 01:09:10.750
My brothers are such jerks.

01:09:11.333 --> 01:09:13.167
They kept blaming me for everything.

01:09:14.042 --> 01:09:15.750
I want to go live on my own.

01:09:15.833 --> 01:09:17.167
No one can yell at me then.

01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:19.125
Where would you even go?

01:09:19.708 --> 01:09:20.917
To my own home.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
When is that?

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:24.000
As soon as possible.

01:09:24.083 --> 01:09:27.208
Do you have money
to buy a house of your own?

01:09:29.083 --> 01:09:32.542
My home has to be peaceful.

01:09:33.417 --> 01:09:36.750
That way,
anyone who enters it will be happy.

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:41.667
Eventually, everyone will go live
in their own houses.

01:09:42.625 --> 01:09:46.667
For now, your job is to study hard

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:49.708
so that your dream can come true.

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:51.792
Okay?

01:10:08.833 --> 01:10:11.042
- Dad.
- What have you done this time?

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:15.375
I was summoned
because you injured your schoolmate!

01:10:16.833 --> 01:10:19.375
Dad, I can explain. I didn't mean to...

01:10:19.458 --> 01:10:21.250
Save your excuses.

01:10:23.042 --> 01:10:25.750
Why must you always
bring harm to others? Why?!

01:10:27.333 --> 01:10:28.750
Haven't you done enough?

01:10:29.333 --> 01:10:33.000
Haven't you ruined this family
enough already?

01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:35.208
My life is in ruins because of you!

01:10:35.292 --> 01:10:36.333
Isn't that enough?

01:10:38.583 --> 01:10:40.083
I'm so sorry, Dad.

01:10:40.167 --> 01:10:43.458
- I won't do it again...
- No. Save your tears.

01:10:44.333 --> 01:10:47.292
Save your tears. I don't care for them.

01:10:48.583 --> 01:10:51.625
Do you have what it takes to defy me?

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:54.458
- No, Dad.
- You want to fight me?

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.792
Fight me!

01:10:56.875 --> 01:10:59.208
- Fight me!
- No, Dad!

01:10:59.292 --> 01:11:01.292
I dare you to do it! Do it!

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:20.042
Get out of here.

01:11:21.125 --> 01:11:24.042
Go far away, and never come back.

01:11:24.625 --> 01:11:26.750
This is not your home anymore.

01:11:28.375 --> 01:11:31.292
This family is not your family.

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:34.750
And you

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:37.250
are not my daughter.

01:12:03.958 --> 01:12:07.083
Hey. I stopped by because I saw your car.

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:09.333
We need to show you something.

01:12:09.417 --> 01:12:12.542
We've been meaning to tell you
that Alie didn't hit Nazwa.

01:12:12.625 --> 01:12:14.750
It was Nazwa and her gang
that bullied Alie.

01:12:14.833 --> 01:12:15.833
What do you mean?

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:19.083
This is the actual video.

01:12:19.583 --> 01:12:20.583
Let me see.

01:12:21.917 --> 01:12:23.750
One of our friends recorded it.

01:12:23.833 --> 01:12:27.792
She failed to raise you right,
so Natta's dad got sick of you.

01:12:27.875 --> 01:12:29.833
- Leave my mom out of this.
- Oh, man.

01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:32.500
- So she didn't lie.
- She never did, Sam.

01:12:33.667 --> 01:12:35.583
- Send the video to Samuel.
- Okay.

01:12:37.875 --> 01:12:39.417
- Done.
- Good.

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.125
Come on, Sam. Thank you.

01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:43.750
Let's go, Sel.

01:12:48.792 --> 01:12:49.792
Watch it.

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:52.833
- Hey, where's Alie?
- Give me a break.

01:12:52.917 --> 01:12:54.167
You're too late.

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:57.458
Dad was yelling at her furiously.

01:12:57.542 --> 01:12:59.125
Then he kicked her out.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:00.417
What?

01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:03.917
Dipta, you're the eldest.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.458
You let her get kicked out?

01:13:05.542 --> 01:13:06.750
Why do you care?

01:13:09.292 --> 01:13:10.292
Tell them, Sam.

01:13:17.667 --> 01:13:18.667
Look at this.

01:13:19.667 --> 01:13:21.458
- What's this?
- Watch the video.

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:24.750
Alie is innocent.

01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:30.083
She failed to raise you right,
so Natta's dad got sick of you.

01:13:30.167 --> 01:13:31.583
Leave my mom out of this.

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:35.333
- I'll go find her.
- You don't deserve to talk about her.

01:13:35.417 --> 01:13:37.125
She can't have gone too far.

01:13:51.292 --> 01:13:53.042
You guys don't want to come with me?

01:13:58.417 --> 01:14:00.542
I don't get it. Is this even a family?

01:14:00.625 --> 01:14:01.625
Hey.

01:14:02.833 --> 01:14:04.167
What did you just say?

01:14:07.917 --> 01:14:09.208
Say that again.

01:14:10.292 --> 01:14:11.542
Is this even a family?

01:14:11.625 --> 01:14:13.042
You've got some nerve.

01:14:15.792 --> 01:14:19.458
We can't forget that it was
her carelessness that caused Mom's death.

01:14:19.542 --> 01:14:21.708
Our mom, Nat! Did you forget that?

01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:26.125
And I lost my future.

01:14:29.042 --> 01:14:30.708
She's ruined all of us.

01:14:31.875 --> 01:14:32.875
All of us?

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.167
No. Just you.

01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:38.208
- You bastard!
- Enough. Calm down.

01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:39.417
Say that again!

01:14:41.042 --> 01:14:42.958
You're a grown man. Use your brain.

01:14:43.042 --> 01:14:44.792
- You use your brain!
- No, you should!

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:50.042
Just because you hold a grudge against her
you let her get kicked out.

01:14:51.583 --> 01:14:54.000
She's still family, no matter what.

01:14:55.208 --> 01:14:56.500
She's still our sister.

01:14:58.375 --> 01:15:00.625
Do you think this is what Mom would want?

01:15:02.167 --> 01:15:04.917
Who do you think
could take over Mom's responsibilities?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
It's Alie.

01:15:07.958 --> 01:15:10.708
Who'll take care of Dad when he's sick?
It's Alie.

01:15:11.208 --> 01:15:13.625
Would you do that, Ren? Or would you?

01:15:13.708 --> 01:15:15.167
It has always been Alie.

01:15:18.917 --> 01:15:20.083
Not even I could do it.

01:15:24.542 --> 01:15:26.000
Do whatever you all want.

01:15:26.875 --> 01:15:28.167
You're all heartless.

01:16:09.292 --> 01:16:12.625
Hey. What are you doing all by yourself?

01:16:13.333 --> 01:16:14.750
Let me keep you company.

01:16:16.958 --> 01:16:18.167
Are you crying?

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:20.167
What happened, little girl?

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:21.833
I'll keep you company.

01:16:21.917 --> 01:16:23.333
I could cheer you up.

01:16:23.417 --> 01:16:24.500
Hey.

01:16:26.042 --> 01:16:27.333
Where are you going?

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:30.000
Where are you going, pretty girl?

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:32.875
Just come with me.

01:16:33.417 --> 01:16:35.458
Your head's all bruised.
Let me look at it.

01:16:35.542 --> 01:16:39.208
Hey. Where are you running off to, girl?

01:16:39.292 --> 01:16:41.125
Go! Get her!

01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:45.500
Hey, pretty girl.

01:17:01.542 --> 01:17:05.292
- Where are you going?
- That's Alie!

01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:07.250
- Come on.
- No.

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.125
What happened to her?

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:17.958
Hey!

01:17:19.625 --> 01:17:20.792
Bastard!

01:17:20.875 --> 01:17:22.417
You bastard!

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.083
Scumbag!

01:17:24.167 --> 01:17:26.000
Alie, over here!

01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:31.625
Let go of me, you bastard!

01:17:34.542 --> 01:17:35.667
Dipta!

01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:41.208
Dipta!

01:17:42.292 --> 01:17:43.750
- Come on.
- Hey.

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:50.333
Dipta!

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.500
Dipta…

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.333
You're not going anywhere.

01:17:56.208 --> 01:17:58.458
Dipta! Natta!

01:17:59.042 --> 01:18:00.167
Natta!

01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:06.042
Li, call Samuel.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Dipta…

01:18:09.625 --> 01:18:13.500
Samuel, some thug stabbed Dipta.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:17.000
He's… Hurry up and come pick us up.

01:18:20.292 --> 01:18:22.292
Nat, where's Dipta?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.375
He's with the doctor.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:42.333
Alie.

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:43.625
How's Dipta?

01:18:44.958 --> 01:18:46.292
He's right next to us.

01:18:46.833 --> 01:18:48.042
Dad just got here.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:50.833
Rendra and Samuel too.

01:18:57.958 --> 01:18:59.375
I'm so sorry.

01:19:00.917 --> 01:19:02.958
I shouldn't have left home.

01:19:04.542 --> 01:19:06.792
Then Dipta wouldn't have gotten hurt.

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:08.917
It's not your fault, Li.

01:19:09.958 --> 01:19:11.667
It's your brothers' fault.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.375
We should've protected you.

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:18.417
Had I not fought with Nazwa,
that video wouldn't have existed.

01:19:20.292 --> 01:19:24.125
Dad wouldn't have gotten mad at me
and kicked me out.

01:19:27.875 --> 01:19:28.875
Dad.

01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:37.292
How's Dipta doing, Dad?

01:19:41.125 --> 01:19:42.875
He needs a blood transfusion.

01:19:44.958 --> 01:19:46.750
They don't have his blood type here.

01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:51.458
I have to look for it somewhere else.

01:19:51.958 --> 01:19:53.125
Or find a donor.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:00.417
But I don't know where to find it,
or who the donor could be.

01:20:09.083 --> 01:20:10.083
Dad?

01:20:15.667 --> 01:20:18.458
Why don't you let me be his donor?

01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:20.208
Hey.

01:20:20.792 --> 01:20:23.250
We have the same blood type.

01:20:23.333 --> 01:20:24.792
It's not that.

01:20:25.583 --> 01:20:28.333
You need to be at least 17 years old
to donate blood.

01:20:29.708 --> 01:20:30.708
You're just 15.

01:20:31.375 --> 01:20:32.875
I don't mind.

01:20:32.958 --> 01:20:37.875
I don't want you to go out of your way
to find a donor.

01:20:43.375 --> 01:20:46.250
I don't want Dipta…

01:20:55.458 --> 01:20:57.875
I don't want to lose him like Mom.

01:21:01.708 --> 01:21:04.375
I don't want you to suffer any more
because of me, Dad.

01:21:08.917 --> 01:21:11.125
Let me make up for my mistakes.

01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:16.000
I don't want to keep dragging you all down
with my misfortunes.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:21.125
I want to do some good for my family.

01:21:47.125 --> 01:21:49.125
- Excuse me, sir.
- Oh, right.

01:21:50.292 --> 01:21:52.292
This is a letter stating that you agree

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:55.292
that your underaged child
will be the blood donor.

01:21:56.042 --> 01:21:59.917
Please read it carefully,
and if you're certain, you may sign it.

01:22:15.542 --> 01:22:17.000
What's it going to be, sir?

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.792
You should go be with Dad.

01:22:29.625 --> 01:22:31.167
I can take care of myself.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.042
Are you sure?

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:38.500
All right. I'll be back later.

01:22:40.333 --> 01:22:41.333
Thank you.

01:23:02.958 --> 01:23:04.167
Has it been an hour?

01:23:04.667 --> 01:23:05.750
More than an hour.

01:23:08.042 --> 01:23:09.667
What's taking them so long?

01:23:11.042 --> 01:23:12.417
We need to be patient.

01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:26.583
Mr. Abimanyu?

01:23:27.958 --> 01:23:30.417
- How did it go, Doc?
- The surgery went well.

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.750
They're taking him
to the recovery room now.

01:23:32.833 --> 01:23:35.375
We'll let him get some rest, shall we?

01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:37.500
Okay, Doc. Thank you.

01:23:38.458 --> 01:23:39.458
I'll get going.

01:23:39.542 --> 01:23:42.625
- Thank you very much, Doc.
- Thank you, Doc.

01:23:49.083 --> 01:23:50.083
Ren.

01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:52.250
- I'm going to go.
- Okay.

01:23:52.333 --> 01:23:54.833
- Let me know if something happens.
- I will.

01:23:54.917 --> 01:23:55.917
- Okay?
- Okay, Dad.

01:23:58.042 --> 01:24:01.042
- I'm going to let Alie know.
- Okay.

01:24:05.208 --> 01:24:06.208
Li?

01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:12.750
Alie?

01:24:50.708 --> 01:24:51.958
- Alie?
- Alie.

01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:53.750
Alie?

01:24:58.583 --> 01:24:59.625
- Alie.
- Alie?

01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:04.250
Li?

01:25:09.583 --> 01:25:10.583
Alie…

01:25:33.667 --> 01:25:35.500
Alie's gone, Sam.

01:25:41.792 --> 01:25:44.000
She's had enough of our selfishness.

01:26:14.375 --> 01:26:16.958
I won't be a burden on you anymore, Dad.

01:26:18.542 --> 01:26:20.042
Please forgive me.

01:26:27.875 --> 01:26:29.708
But why are they so mean to me?

01:26:30.208 --> 01:26:32.458
They're not exactly mean.

01:26:33.792 --> 01:26:35.542
They're just…

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:38.125
Jealous.

01:26:39.667 --> 01:26:44.333
They never had
a beautiful, clever sister before.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.250
Maybe that's how they show their love.

01:26:52.125 --> 01:26:55.167
You may all be mad at each other.

01:26:56.833 --> 01:26:58.708
But you must remember

01:27:00.250 --> 01:27:04.083
to always respect your elders.

01:27:04.167 --> 01:27:05.167
Don't talk back.

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.583
Because after all,

01:27:09.708 --> 01:27:11.042
we are family.

01:27:12.125 --> 01:27:13.125
Got it, sweetie?

01:27:14.583 --> 01:27:17.042
- Okay, Mom.
- My beloved daughter.

01:28:11.542 --> 01:28:13.208
It's your new home, Li.

01:28:16.542 --> 01:28:18.917
Though it's nothing like your dream home.

01:28:22.292 --> 01:28:23.875
And it's a small one.

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.292
At least no one's going to yell
at you anymore.

01:28:35.708 --> 01:28:38.292
You can run around
as much as you want there.

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.042
And be reunited with Mom.

01:28:54.375 --> 01:28:56.875
God loves you more than anyone else could.

01:29:00.375 --> 01:29:01.833
Forgive us, Li.

01:29:04.292 --> 01:29:07.083
Because the way
we expressed our love for you…

01:29:09.458 --> 01:29:11.125
left you broken.

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:44.333
My home has to be peaceful.

01:29:44.833 --> 01:29:49.042
That way,
anyone who enters it will be happy.

01:29:52.667 --> 01:29:56.250
But this is not your home, Alie.

01:29:56.333 --> 01:29:57.875
This is my home, Mom.

01:29:57.958 --> 01:29:59.833
Your home is not here.

01:29:59.917 --> 01:30:02.083
But I want to be with you, Mom.

01:30:02.167 --> 01:30:04.042
Then I won't be lonely anymore.

01:30:04.125 --> 01:30:05.208
Go home, sweetie.

01:30:06.083 --> 01:30:07.250
I'm begging you.

01:30:07.333 --> 01:30:09.625
Mom, I want to stay here.

01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:12.792
I'm happy here with you.

01:30:12.875 --> 01:30:19.750
Alie, your father and brothers
are waiting for you.

01:30:19.833 --> 01:30:21.750
But I'm scared, Mom.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:27.667
Alie, if we have only love in our heart,

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:33.625
there won't be any place for fear,
let alone hatred.

01:30:33.708 --> 01:30:37.750
Because our heart is already full of love.

01:31:08.833 --> 01:31:10.083
Mom…

01:31:18.458 --> 01:31:22.458
DOMESTIC AND SCHOOL VIOLENCE,
NO MATTER HOW SMALL,

01:31:22.542 --> 01:31:26.542
WILL LEAVE BEHIND WOUNDS AND TRAUMA.

01:34:19.708 --> 01:34:24.125
I FORGIVE, BUT I CAN NEVER FORGET

01:34:24.208 --> 01:34:29.667
BULLYING NEEDS TO STOP

01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:33.750
MY TRAUMA FROM BEING BULLIED
