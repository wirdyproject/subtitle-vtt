WEBVTT

00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:37.625
Who's there?

00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:25.666
Geez. Oh God.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.875
SRIKANDI BOARDING HOUSE

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:52.583
Happy Birthday, Kenara Cahyaningrum.

00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:59.375
I knew it was just an excuse.

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:02.125
You said you had
an event on campus, right?

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:04.833
Even though you were not on the committee.

00:04:06.416 --> 00:04:08.291
Well, what else could I do?

00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:11.375
If I went home, Raka would come.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.583
He cheated on you with your best friend,

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:19.375
and he still has no shame.

00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:24.666
My poor bestie. She's traumatized
to go home to Jakarta.

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.791
And she's traumatized to dance too.

00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:33.166
But Nar, the boarding house
is quiet this year.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.000
I was passing through the hallway earlier
and the lights in several rooms were off.

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:40.583
Don't you want to come home with me?

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:47.000
You should know my village.
It's called Kelawangin Village.

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:51.208
I think I've heard the name before.

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:58.500
In the past,
lots of dancers were born there.

00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:01.708
But now, it's increasingly rare.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.333
It's better than being here
and being sad about Raka.

00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:12.208
What are you saying?

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:15.416
I'm going in. I'm sleepy.

00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:18.791
Nar, come with me
to buy souvenirs tomorrow, okay?

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:22.041
-No problem. Bye.
-Bye.

00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:09.708
YOU'RE NOT COMING HOME AGAIN THIS YEAR?

00:06:09.791 --> 00:06:11.875
HAVE PITY ON YOUR MOTHER

00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.750
HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING
TO STAY AWAY FROM ME?

00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:16.291
I'M NOT WITH LINA ANYMORE
NAR, I MISS YOU

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:17.625
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:20.333
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY
I WISH YOU HEALTH AND HAPPINESS THERE

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:43.625
KELAWANGIN VILLAGE
HIDDEN GEM ON THE MOUNTAIN SLOPES

00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.125
DANCE TOURISM IN KELAWANGIN VILLAGE
HAS DROPPED DRASTICALLY

00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:56.000
KELAWANGIN VILLAGE GIVES BIRTH
TO MANY TALENTED DANCERS

00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:04.541
KELAWANGIN VILLAGE TOURISM HAS BECOME
A POPULAR DESTINATION FOR TOURISTS

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:07.666
IT HAS BEEN ALMOST TEN YEARS
SINCE MAYANG PUTRICANDRA

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.958
THE YOUNG DANCER, IS MISSING

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:52.500
Two of these. And bakpia, ma'am.

00:07:53.583 --> 00:07:55.250
What flavors are available for the bakpia?

00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:56.833
Chocolate…

00:07:58.875 --> 00:07:59.875
This one.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.833
One chocolate…

00:08:06.916 --> 00:08:08.750
-Ayu, I'm going there.
-Yes.

00:08:08.833 --> 00:08:11.166
One chocolate, two cheese.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.166
It's for you, child.

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:19.291
This shawl has chosen its own master.

00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:25.333
Whoever is chosen by the shawl

00:09:25.416 --> 00:09:28.333
will be bound forever.

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:36.916
That's it, child.

00:09:49.416 --> 00:09:51.625
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:53.583
Yu. Look.

00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:55.875
-This was given to me.
-By whom?

00:09:56.375 --> 00:10:01.166
From the old lady over there,
from the antique shop.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.458
She said this shawl
chose me as its master.

00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:07.625
She also gave me this.

00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:10.750
Nar, it's really scary.

00:10:10.833 --> 00:10:14.166
Don't just accept things from strangers.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.208
-Don't you believe me? Come with me.
-No need. Let's go.

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:19.958
Huh?

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.083
FOR RENT

00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:31.250
SRIKANDI BOARDING HOUSE

00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:45.708
Kelawangin.

00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:48.333
Come on. Please, get in.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:51.125
Kelawangin.

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:54.000
-Come on. Kelawangin.
-Come here, ma'am! Let's go!

00:11:54.083 --> 00:11:57.458
-Come on!
-Ma'am…

00:11:58.916 --> 00:12:00.500
We've arrived at Kelawangin.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.375
Come on, Nar. It's raining so hard.

00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:09.416
KELAWANGIN VILLAGE

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.500
Come on, Nar.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Yes.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.125
-Come on. Let's take shelter.
-What?

00:12:15.625 --> 00:12:17.375
Take shelter for now. Come on.

00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:20.958
Geez.

00:12:22.625 --> 00:12:23.833
It rains so hard.

00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:25.916
Nar, just a little bit more.
We're wet anyway.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.750
It's close. It's over there. Come on.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.833
Nar, come on.

00:12:38.708 --> 00:12:39.708
Okay.

00:12:48.583 --> 00:12:49.625
Come on.

00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:52.500
Peace be upon you.

00:12:53.583 --> 00:12:55.375
Peace be upon you too.

00:12:57.208 --> 00:12:59.083
My daughter's here!

00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:01.833
Mom.

00:13:03.541 --> 00:13:04.541
Come in, Nar.

00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:07.000
This is my friend, Mom.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.375
Her name is Kenar.

00:13:09.458 --> 00:13:11.250
Kenar.

00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:12.791
Pleasure to meet you, Auntie.

00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:14.833
Such a good name.

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:19.375
Why did you go through the rain?

00:13:19.458 --> 00:13:20.958
Why didn't you take shelter first?

00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:24.416
We were almost here.
It rained when we got off.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.583
Oh dear.

00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:29.750
Mom, I brought souvenirs for you and Dad.

00:13:29.833 --> 00:13:33.333
You shouldn't have. But thank you.

00:13:33.416 --> 00:13:34.791
-My daughter.
-Dad.

00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:38.083
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you too.

00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:42.000
-You're wet.
-Yes, Dad.

00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:46.458
Dad, this is Kenar, my friend.

00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:56.833
Kenar, Uncle.

00:13:58.083 --> 00:14:01.666
-Okay then. Go take a bath.
-Yes, Dad.

00:14:03.208 --> 00:14:04.625
Oh God!

00:14:04.708 --> 00:14:08.583
Go take a bath first.
I'll get you some warm water, okay?

00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:10.625
-Thank you, Mom.
-Come on, honey.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.416
Come on, Nar.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.791
Come in, Nar.

00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:32.000
Geez.

00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:41.666
You need a towel? Hang on.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.583
Nar, I'm sorry about
my dad's strange behavior.

00:14:55.083 --> 00:14:57.375
You didn't tell them
that you were going to bring a friend?

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.625
I did. I told my mother.
She must've told my dad too.

00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:06.958
But well… I never bring friends home.

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:11.458
So, I'm the first?

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.208
Yes.

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:17.500
None of my high school friends
wanted to come here.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.916
I told you,

00:15:20.416 --> 00:15:22.416
I don't have many friends.

00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:30.000
Yes?

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:32.958
Ayu, take a bath first.

00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.208
Come on. I've prepared the water.

00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:38.083
Yes, Mom.

00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:54.041
-Leave some for me.
-Okay.

00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:23.833
What's wrong, honey?

00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:53.750
Ayu?

00:16:58.166 --> 00:16:59.125
Ayu?

00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:03.541
Ayu?

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:07.375
That's not Ayu's room.

00:17:12.375 --> 00:17:14.541
Uncle, there was…

00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.125
Yes, Uncle.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.375
Sorry.

00:17:25.416 --> 00:17:27.333
My dad is really annoying.

00:17:28.166 --> 00:17:31.958
Never mind you, it's the same with me.

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:34.916
When I was in high school,

00:17:35.583 --> 00:17:37.166
I wasn't allowed to date.

00:17:37.666 --> 00:17:39.500
He said I was still a kid.

00:17:40.208 --> 00:17:43.041
Now that I'm in college,
I'm still not allowed.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.083
He has a point, Yu.

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:52.250
I regret ever dating.

00:17:53.916 --> 00:17:55.875
In the end, I was hurt.

00:17:56.375 --> 00:18:02.500
At least you had fun because you knew
what it was like to fall in love.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:10.125
But no one is ready to lose someone,

00:18:10.708 --> 00:18:12.666
especially in a painful way.

00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:22.666
So, maybe your father
doesn't want you to be hurt like me.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.000
So, you're not allowed to date.

00:18:28.333 --> 00:18:29.375
Anyway,

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.666
I can see that your father's
actually a good person.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.250
Am I right?

00:18:43.458 --> 00:18:44.375
Yu.

00:18:51.416 --> 00:18:52.916
She fell asleep.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.333
Oh no… Low battery.

00:19:38.875 --> 00:19:43.041
Whoever is chosen by the shawl

00:19:43.125 --> 00:19:45.625
will be bound forever.

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:09.916
Gross.

00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:08.166
Oh God.

00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:15.125
Uncle…

00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:20.333
I came to the kitchen to get a bucket.

00:21:23.083 --> 00:21:25.166
Ayu's room is leaking, Uncle.

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:34.166
Excuse me, Uncle.

00:22:00.833 --> 00:22:05.833
Until death separates you.

00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:36.458
Mom.

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.500
I'm going to take Kenar for a walk.

00:23:39.583 --> 00:23:40.708
Okay then.

00:23:48.916 --> 00:23:50.333
-Take care.
-Okay.

00:23:59.666 --> 00:24:00.500
Hey.

00:24:00.583 --> 00:24:03.708
Because you're a dancer,
I want to take you to a dance studio here.

00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:06.500
-Why?
-Child…

00:24:06.583 --> 00:24:07.583
Hello, sir.

00:24:07.666 --> 00:24:10.750
You have a problem with the cheating guy,
not the dancer.

00:24:10.833 --> 00:24:14.708
But still, he cheated with a dancer.

00:24:14.791 --> 00:24:16.375
It's not related.

00:24:16.458 --> 00:24:17.708
-Ms. Ayu.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:21.208
Nar, come on.

00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:34.791
LARAS BUDOYO DANCE STUDIO

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:51.041
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you too.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.041
-Hi.
-Ms. Ayu.

00:24:56.083 --> 00:24:56.916
How are you?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.708
I'm good, Yu.

00:24:59.875 --> 00:25:03.166
This is my friend from Jakarta.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.708
Her name is Kenar.

00:25:05.625 --> 00:25:06.583
Ma'am.

00:25:07.958 --> 00:25:08.791
Kenar.

00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:12.416
This is Madam Sarti,
a teacher at this dance studio.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:23.250
This is Dirjo, the Saron player,
the idol of the girls here.

00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:31.625
-Dirjo.
-Kenar.

00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:46.500
Do you miss it?

00:25:47.833 --> 00:25:48.666
Huh?

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.458
-What?
-Do you miss dancing?

00:25:55.291 --> 00:25:56.166
Forward.

00:25:58.583 --> 00:26:01.041
Dirjo can't stop looking at you.

00:26:09.041 --> 00:26:09.875
He's smiling.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.375
Come here.

00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:14.666
Madam, my friend here
is a dancer, you know.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.250
-Ask her to dance.
-Ayu.

00:26:16.333 --> 00:26:17.166
Madam…

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.208
-She's a dancer.
-Ayu.

00:26:20.083 --> 00:26:22.541
-Nar, let's dance.
-Yes, teach me.

00:26:22.625 --> 00:26:24.583
-Please dance!
-Let's dance!

00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:25.750
Let's dance.

00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:29.083
-Okay…
-Yes, teach us some moves.

00:26:34.583 --> 00:26:36.958
I haven't danced for a long time.

00:26:38.041 --> 00:26:39.958
I've forgotten. Sorry.

00:26:59.708 --> 00:27:03.625
Enough. Let's get back to dancing.

00:27:04.375 --> 00:27:05.375
Come on.

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:08.666
There.

00:27:16.208 --> 00:27:18.166
I have a feeling

00:27:19.291 --> 00:27:21.583
that Banyu is here now.

00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:34.208
Who will be his victim now?

00:27:36.291 --> 00:27:37.291
Honey.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.166
I'm still not sure…

00:27:45.208 --> 00:27:49.833
that Banyu had something to do
with Mayang's death ten years ago.

00:27:51.875 --> 00:27:53.041
What do you mean?

00:27:55.333 --> 00:27:58.791
Banyu had no grudge against that girl.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.708
Honey.

00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:05.208
You knew Banyu well, right?

00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:18.125
So, Dirjo's uncle
is a well-known guy here.

00:28:19.333 --> 00:28:23.333
He made this village prosperous.

00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:29.250
But I feel sorry for Dirjo.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.625
Kenar?

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.458
Are you even here?

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.625
What did you say?

00:28:41.625 --> 00:28:42.625
What did you talk about?

00:28:42.708 --> 00:28:45.958
Dirjo's parents have died.

00:28:47.875 --> 00:28:49.583
And his sister is missing.

00:28:50.333 --> 00:28:51.958
They still haven't found her.

00:28:55.208 --> 00:28:56.166
How come?

00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:00.916
I'm going to sleep.

00:29:24.583 --> 00:29:25.958
Who are you?

00:30:00.375 --> 00:30:04.833
Stop! Help!

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.083
Go away!

00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:26.958
Come with me.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:34.916
Ayu.

00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:36.541
Yu. Wake up, Yu.

00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:38.375
Yu, wake up.

00:34:23.625 --> 00:34:27.958
Actually, this isn't the first time
I've seen that figure.

00:34:29.875 --> 00:34:32.375
She has been in my dreams before.

00:34:35.125 --> 00:34:36.166
And…

00:34:37.083 --> 00:34:39.750
there was a black figure.

00:34:40.833 --> 00:34:42.416
A really scary figure.

00:34:48.041 --> 00:34:50.291
Actually, I don't want to tell this story.

00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:55.500
What story?

00:34:59.833 --> 00:35:02.500
I don't know if this is related or not.

00:35:04.416 --> 00:35:06.625
I heard the story from other people.

00:35:07.541 --> 00:35:10.166
My parents never told me anything.

00:35:13.375 --> 00:35:15.708
That room in my house

00:35:16.708 --> 00:35:18.125
was my uncle's.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.833
My dad's younger brother.

00:35:22.166 --> 00:35:23.541
His name was Banyu.

00:35:26.625 --> 00:35:30.000
Dad never let anyone into that room.

00:35:30.708 --> 00:35:32.541
Even my mother.

00:35:35.083 --> 00:35:36.208
He…

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.500
had a girlfriend.

00:35:41.416 --> 00:35:42.875
A dancer.

00:35:44.625 --> 00:35:46.166
Her name was Ratih Mahyu.

00:35:48.166 --> 00:35:50.166
She lived in this village too.

00:35:55.208 --> 00:35:57.083
My uncle died

00:35:57.791 --> 00:36:00.125
because he was burned alive
by the villagers.

00:36:02.958 --> 00:36:06.833
My father also restricts me
from socializing with the people here.

00:36:07.708 --> 00:36:09.791
That's why I've been
out of town since high school.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.708
But people believe

00:36:16.833 --> 00:36:19.083
that every ten years…

00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:22.958
he will ask for a sacrifice.

00:36:23.875 --> 00:36:25.500
Another dancer.

00:36:28.958 --> 00:36:30.875
And when I was little,

00:36:31.958 --> 00:36:33.750
there was already one victim.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.958
She disappeared until now.

00:36:42.291 --> 00:36:43.833
Dirja's younger sister.

00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:13.875
Mayang once told me
that Ratih Mahyu often visited her.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.791
Ratih Mahyu is an extension of Banyu
to take revenge on the people here.

00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:29.541
That's why every ten years,
my uncle always holds a closed ritual

00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:32.125
to appease Banyu's spirit.

00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:33.375
Wait a minute.

00:37:34.041 --> 00:37:34.958
So, are you saying

00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:38.291
that Kenar should meet Uncle Adi
to discuss this?

00:37:43.958 --> 00:37:47.500
No need. It's okay. I'm bothering you.

00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:50.708
Actually, I'm okay.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:56.916
I'm just confused.
What does all this have to do with me?

00:38:00.125 --> 00:38:01.125
Ayu.

00:38:02.666 --> 00:38:05.750
You must be thinking
about your dad and my uncle, right?

00:38:06.875 --> 00:38:09.750
My dad surely doesn't want to have
anything to do with Uncle Adi.

00:38:10.833 --> 00:38:12.208
Yes, I know.

00:38:17.291 --> 00:38:18.666
For now…

00:38:20.708 --> 00:38:22.583
this is all I can tell you.

00:38:25.166 --> 00:38:27.000
If she asks you to dance,

00:38:28.208 --> 00:38:29.250
don't do it.

00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:31.416
Fight her.

00:38:57.333 --> 00:38:58.500
Have a drink, honey.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:23.625
Where is she?

00:39:28.625 --> 00:39:32.250
Dancer.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.958
Honey?

00:39:40.291 --> 00:39:41.458
Honey?

00:39:48.708 --> 00:39:50.125
What's wrong?

00:39:53.166 --> 00:39:54.208
Nothing.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:34.833
Open.

00:40:48.541 --> 00:40:49.833
Where am I?

00:41:01.833 --> 00:41:03.208
Why is it locked?

00:41:03.916 --> 00:41:05.958
Open!

00:41:06.916 --> 00:41:09.125
-Open!
-Calm down.

00:41:56.375 --> 00:41:58.041
TWIN ECLIPSE

00:42:29.416 --> 00:42:30.958
TWIN ECLIPSE

00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:34.166
TWO SOULS, ONE LOVE, ONE REVENGE
NARIK SUKMO

00:42:37.041 --> 00:42:38.083
Dance.

00:42:57.125 --> 00:42:59.666
No.

00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:01.250
No!

00:43:36.541 --> 00:43:38.250
Stop!

00:43:40.208 --> 00:43:43.291
Help!

00:44:06.791 --> 00:44:08.083
Dance.

00:44:12.625 --> 00:44:13.625
Kenar?

00:44:14.208 --> 00:44:15.250
Kenar!

00:44:16.125 --> 00:44:17.250
Kenar?

00:44:18.708 --> 00:44:20.625
Mom, Kenar…

00:44:23.375 --> 00:44:24.583
Kenar?

00:44:25.708 --> 00:44:26.708
Kenar?

00:44:27.208 --> 00:44:28.291
Kenar?

00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:31.708
Dad, open it quickly!

00:44:32.333 --> 00:44:34.083
-Nar. Open, Kenar!
-Kenar!

00:44:36.291 --> 00:44:37.333
Kenar.

00:44:38.083 --> 00:44:39.083
Kenar.

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:02.083
Kenar?

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:03.791
Dad. Hurry, Dad.

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:06.833
Kenar. Dad, come on. Hurry, Dad.

00:45:06.916 --> 00:45:10.166
-What has been buried…
-Kenar!

00:45:10.666 --> 00:45:11.500
Kenar.

00:45:11.583 --> 00:45:14.583
-…will rise.
-Kenar!

00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:18.083
Kenar.

00:45:18.791 --> 00:45:20.000
Kenar.

00:45:20.708 --> 00:45:22.458
-Kenar.
-Open, Kenar.

00:45:30.041 --> 00:45:31.166
Help!

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:32.500
Kenar!

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:44.083
Pawned soul

00:45:45.291 --> 00:45:47.625
-is asking for
-Kenar!

00:45:47.708 --> 00:45:49.791
a ransom.

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.208
-Love, death
-Kenar!

00:45:53.291 --> 00:45:55.791
-will demand
-Kenar!

00:45:55.875 --> 00:46:00.125
one of the nights.

00:46:00.833 --> 00:46:02.250
-Kenar!
-Just break it, Dad.

00:46:02.333 --> 00:46:04.833
No flowers.

00:46:21.833 --> 00:46:23.791
Kenar!

00:46:23.875 --> 00:46:25.416
-Kenar!
-Child!

00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:26.916
-Child?
-Child.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.375
-Kenar!
-Child.

00:46:28.875 --> 00:46:29.875
Child.

00:46:30.875 --> 00:46:32.541
Ayu!

00:46:34.666 --> 00:46:36.416
What time is it now?

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:38.833
Ayu!

00:46:42.666 --> 00:46:45.750
I'm just scared
something will happen to you.

00:46:45.833 --> 00:46:48.166
What will happen, Dad?

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:49.541
What's actually going on?

00:46:50.333 --> 00:46:53.916
Dad. What's actually
going on with our family?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.041
You never tell me anything.

00:46:56.125 --> 00:46:59.750
-Suddenly, my friend flew like that.
-I don't understand either!

00:46:59.833 --> 00:47:01.083
You're lying!

00:47:01.166 --> 00:47:02.375
Enough!

00:47:03.333 --> 00:47:05.125
Ayu!

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.916
Yu… Where's Kenar?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.625
You said that my uncle and Ratih Mahyu

00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.000
have a grudge
against the villagers, right?

00:47:23.083 --> 00:47:26.708
So, why is Kenar affected?
She doesn't come from here.

00:47:27.291 --> 00:47:28.208
What happened?

00:47:29.041 --> 00:47:30.375
What's going on, Yu?

00:47:30.458 --> 00:47:32.958
I want to bring Kenar back to Yogya.

00:47:33.625 --> 00:47:34.875
It's no longer safe here.

00:47:37.333 --> 00:47:38.666
How is it not safe?

00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:42.416
I don't want Kenar
to have the same fate as Mayang.

00:48:00.375 --> 00:48:01.333
Auntie…

00:48:02.666 --> 00:48:05.083
Thank you, Auntie, Uncle.

00:48:06.541 --> 00:48:08.500
Take good care of yourself, okay?

00:48:17.041 --> 00:48:18.291
It's okay.

00:48:20.666 --> 00:48:21.500
Let's go.

00:48:22.375 --> 00:48:23.583
Are you okay, Nar?

00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:25.208
I'm okay.

00:48:25.708 --> 00:48:29.583
-I'm sorry. If I didn't bring you here…
-It's okay, Yu.

00:48:29.666 --> 00:48:31.458
This is not your fault.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.458
Gotcha!

00:48:55.333 --> 00:48:57.708
Kenar. Calm down, okay?

00:48:58.208 --> 00:49:00.333
-No. Shut up. Where's Ayu?
-I can explain.

00:49:00.416 --> 00:49:01.291
Where's Ayu?

00:49:01.375 --> 00:49:03.333
You were thrown away
by Mr. Prastomo's people.

00:49:03.416 --> 00:49:04.875
That's why I brought you here now.

00:49:05.458 --> 00:49:06.791
Impossible. Lies!

00:49:06.875 --> 00:49:07.791
-No.
-I can't possibly…

00:49:07.875 --> 00:49:09.583
-Why would I lie to you?
-So, where's Ayu?

00:49:09.666 --> 00:49:11.333
I don't know where Ayu is.

00:49:11.416 --> 00:49:13.250
Maybe she got affected
by his father's story.

00:49:13.875 --> 00:49:17.083
How do you know Ayu's father
sent those people?

00:49:20.583 --> 00:49:22.250
I'm from here, Kenar.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.000
Of course I know.

00:49:25.791 --> 00:49:27.958
In Dewa Kelawangin, there are two groups.

00:49:28.958 --> 00:49:32.125
Mr. Prastomo's group and my uncle's group.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.041
This is my sister's room, Mayang.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:46.500
Calm yourself for now, okay?

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.833
Tonight, I'll take you to the terminal
to return to Yogya.

00:50:25.583 --> 00:50:26.500
Jo…

00:50:27.916 --> 00:50:30.791
You have to be able to convince the girl.

00:50:33.125 --> 00:50:34.250
Kenar, right?

00:50:36.208 --> 00:50:38.041
She's here already anyway.

00:50:39.125 --> 00:50:40.875
Don't fail.

00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:48.041
Yes, Uncle.

00:50:50.875 --> 00:50:52.541
But what about Ayu, Uncle?

00:50:55.458 --> 00:50:58.041
As for Ayu, that's my business.

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:06.166
After Kenar regains consciousness,
after she wakes up,

00:51:08.458 --> 00:51:13.416
we have to carry out
the ritual immediately.

00:51:15.541 --> 00:51:19.083
Keep it from running away.

00:51:23.333 --> 00:51:24.333
Can you?

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.666
Drink first, Yu.

00:52:08.583 --> 00:52:09.583
Mom…

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:14.291
I want to look for Kenar, okay?

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:17.750
Do it later.

00:52:17.833 --> 00:52:19.000
Mom…

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.375
Where is she?

00:52:21.458 --> 00:52:24.333
Later. You're still weak.

00:52:25.125 --> 00:52:27.041
Hopefully, Kenar is fine.

00:52:27.125 --> 00:52:28.500
-Honey.
-Mom…

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.833
Dad. Where's Kenar? Have you found her?

00:52:33.625 --> 00:52:34.583
Not yet.

00:52:35.083 --> 00:52:36.625
Nobody saw her.

00:52:37.125 --> 00:52:42.291
But I've asked my people
to look for her. Okay?

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:44.250
Okay then.

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.875
Go away!

00:52:48.625 --> 00:52:50.208
Help! Go away!

00:52:50.291 --> 00:52:52.000
-Ayu. I'm your father.
-Help!

00:52:52.708 --> 00:52:56.250
Ayu, I'm your dad. I'm your father!

00:52:57.208 --> 00:52:59.500
Dad.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.083
Dad.

00:53:01.583 --> 00:53:03.500
There was a black figure.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
-I saw a black figure.
-Calm down, okay?

00:53:08.083 --> 00:53:09.333
Calm down.

00:53:09.833 --> 00:53:10.791
You calm down.

00:53:10.875 --> 00:53:11.833
Ayu…

00:53:14.375 --> 00:53:16.541
Calm down, child. Ayu.

00:53:20.083 --> 00:53:21.500
Calm down, okay?

00:53:24.708 --> 00:53:25.583
Okay.

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:29.416
I'm here, Yu. I'm here.

00:53:33.166 --> 00:53:34.291
Who are you?

00:53:35.291 --> 00:53:36.833
What do you want, little brother?

00:53:36.916 --> 00:53:41.166
BANYU CIPTO, SON OF TJOKRO SUDJIWO

00:53:42.583 --> 00:53:46.083
Is this still about your grudge
from 20 years ago?

00:53:54.791 --> 00:53:56.708
Tell me,

00:53:58.375 --> 00:53:59.666
your big brother.

00:54:01.791 --> 00:54:04.791
Let me avenge it.

00:54:06.666 --> 00:54:07.750
But…

00:54:15.416 --> 00:54:18.833
Don't hurt Ayu.

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.583
Not Ayu.

00:54:31.708 --> 00:54:34.333
She's your girl too.

00:54:35.541 --> 00:54:37.916
Your niece.

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.083
Please.

00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:48.291
Go home.

00:54:52.708 --> 00:54:53.791
Banyu.

00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:55.500
Go home.

00:55:13.458 --> 00:55:14.583
Come out, all of you.

00:55:15.083 --> 00:55:16.250
It's me.

00:55:46.958 --> 00:55:47.958
Stand up!

00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:08.041
Tonight, we carry out the ritual.

00:56:09.583 --> 00:56:11.625
I've found the dancer.

00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:45.541
Stop! Don't bother me. Stop!

00:56:52.458 --> 00:56:53.541
Let me go.

00:56:54.708 --> 00:56:55.916
Let me go!

00:57:00.666 --> 00:57:02.125
The time has come.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.833
No.

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.583
No.

00:57:36.208 --> 00:57:37.541
Kenar?

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:39.333
Are you okay?

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:20.958
Bring the dancer here.

00:58:21.041 --> 00:58:21.875
Yes, sir.

00:58:31.166 --> 00:58:33.333
Kelawangin was prosperous

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:39.208
since Mr. Prastomo
and Banyu's family came here.

00:58:44.541 --> 00:58:45.666
Mr. Prastomo and Banyu

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:48.000
often shared their harvest
with the villagers.

00:58:51.583 --> 00:58:55.125
But one day, the villagers fell ill.

00:58:56.291 --> 00:58:57.833
Some even died.

00:59:03.708 --> 00:59:05.458
After an investigation,

00:59:07.083 --> 00:59:11.083
it was because of the harvest
given by Mr. Prastomo and Banyu.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.625
Angry villagers

00:59:19.125 --> 00:59:21.041
brought Banyu to the field.

00:59:21.125 --> 00:59:21.958
Let's go!

00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:24.458
-Come on!
-Bring him!

00:59:24.541 --> 00:59:25.916
Let me go!

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.666
-It wasn't me!
-Move!

00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:28.958
Take him!

00:59:29.041 --> 00:59:30.416
My uncle tried to stop it.

00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:35.666
But he was ignored.

00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:41.875
-Not me!
-Burn him!

00:59:41.958 --> 00:59:44.166
-No!
-Take him there!

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:46.416
-Hold him!
-Come on!

00:59:49.291 --> 00:59:50.375
No!

00:59:50.458 --> 00:59:51.958
Let me go!

00:59:58.625 --> 01:00:01.250
Let's punish him!

01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:04.000
-Finish him!
-Finish him!

01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:06.458
Get him!

01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:09.083
Let's get him!

01:00:09.166 --> 01:00:10.875
Come on!

01:00:10.958 --> 01:00:12.625
Come on! Get him!

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:14.083
Help!

01:00:14.666 --> 01:00:16.333
-I didn't see it,
-Help!

01:00:16.416 --> 01:00:19.041
but they said Banyu was burned.

01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:19.875
Go!

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:26.291
Since then, Mr. Prastomo's family
withdrew themselves from the community.

01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:30.791
And strange events
began to occur in the village.

01:00:33.958 --> 01:00:35.125
There's a supernatural being

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:39.833
that is rumored to be Banyu.

01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:47.041
Your sister was one of the victims?

01:00:58.666 --> 01:00:59.875
And…

01:01:02.083 --> 01:01:04.166
Ratih Mahyu…

01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:07.458
She was his girlfriend, right?

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.875
Since then, Ratih Mahyu
has disappeared from the village.

01:01:14.833 --> 01:01:16.333
She hanged herself.

01:01:21.833 --> 01:01:23.416
My uncle was heartbroken.

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:29.583
Because they said
my uncle loved Ratih Mahyu.

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:43.083
-Ayu.
-Ayu.

01:01:43.958 --> 01:01:46.041
-Honey!
-Ayu! Honey, water.

01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:49.625
Ayu.

01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:51.625
Ayu.

01:01:54.458 --> 01:01:55.458
Ayu!

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:09.375
Go away.

01:02:09.875 --> 01:02:11.708
Go away, Banyu!

01:02:16.083 --> 01:02:18.041
-Ayu.
-Child.

01:02:18.125 --> 01:02:19.875
Ayu.

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:21.583
-Child.
-Ayu.

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:26.166
Okay.

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:27.083
It's okay.

01:02:30.833 --> 01:02:31.666
Honey.

01:02:54.833 --> 01:02:56.708
What do you want, brother?

01:02:59.625 --> 01:03:00.666
What?

01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:14.416
Is this your doing?

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:17.541
Ratih Mahyu?

01:03:20.916 --> 01:03:23.958
I've been silent for 20 years.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.833
We both know what happened
and who is responsible for all of this.

01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:40.541
Ratih asked me to be quiet,

01:03:40.625 --> 01:03:43.250
without having to avenge anything,

01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:45.208
and I obey!

01:03:45.291 --> 01:03:46.541
I obey!

01:03:54.416 --> 01:03:56.458
But what's going on?

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.416
What's going on?

01:04:03.333 --> 01:04:05.000
Ayu…

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.333
My only child…

01:04:08.416 --> 01:04:11.041
You hurt her!

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.625
How could you, brother?

01:04:16.208 --> 01:04:18.375
How could you?

01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:26.958
Come on out! Come out!

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:35.958
How could you?

01:04:53.125 --> 01:04:54.458
TWIN ECLIPSE

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:26.958
Twin eclipse.

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:29.333
Two souls.

01:05:29.916 --> 01:05:31.166
One love.

01:05:31.791 --> 01:05:33.666
One revenge.

01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:36.916
Narik Sukmo.

01:05:37.791 --> 01:05:38.666
Dancer.

01:06:17.416 --> 01:06:18.416
What is it?

01:06:18.916 --> 01:06:20.958
My uncle is holding a ritual

01:06:21.916 --> 01:06:24.583
to appease the spirits
of Banyu and Ratih Mahyu.

01:06:28.208 --> 01:06:29.875
We have to go to the dance studio now.

01:06:35.166 --> 01:06:36.500
Me too?

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.458
Yes.

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:44.500
And where is Ayu?

01:06:45.458 --> 01:06:46.583
Ayu…

01:06:49.291 --> 01:06:51.125
Ayu should be there.

01:06:52.958 --> 01:06:54.166
She's waiting for you.

01:07:30.666 --> 01:07:31.625
Honey.

01:07:38.333 --> 01:07:40.250
Where are you going?

01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:41.375
Honey.

01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:45.125
I know where Kenar is.

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:46.916
Where is she?

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.958
Just stay at home, okay?

01:07:51.041 --> 01:07:53.833
Close the doors and windows tightly.

01:07:54.333 --> 01:07:56.166
Wait for me to come home.

01:07:57.458 --> 01:07:59.083
-What's going on?
-Calm down.

01:08:01.833 --> 01:08:04.708
Banyu isn't the culprit.

01:08:07.666 --> 01:08:09.333
Not my brother.

01:08:10.833 --> 01:08:14.708
Banyu and Ratih Mahyu

01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:18.250
is using the girl to take revenge.

01:08:20.166 --> 01:08:23.083
Honey. It's time.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.458
It's time.

01:08:29.166 --> 01:08:30.083
Honey…

01:08:32.666 --> 01:08:34.041
I'll leave Ayu with you, okay?

01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:37.208
-Why are you saying that?
-Calm down.

01:08:39.875 --> 01:08:40.875
Calm down.

01:08:42.041 --> 01:08:43.083
Okay?

01:08:44.791 --> 01:08:46.416
Please tell Ayu

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:51.583
that I'm sorry, okay?

01:08:57.958 --> 01:08:59.000
Honey…

01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:02.875
-Be careful.
-Okay.

01:09:04.083 --> 01:09:06.000
Okay? I'll take my leave.

01:09:58.083 --> 01:09:59.125
Dirja?

01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:03.291
Help!

01:12:03.375 --> 01:12:05.041
Help!

01:12:05.125 --> 01:12:07.958
-Help! Let me go!
-Bring him!

01:12:08.041 --> 01:12:09.833
-Come on!
-Take him!

01:12:09.916 --> 01:12:11.625
I'm not the culprit!

01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:12.583
Let's go!

01:12:12.666 --> 01:12:14.666
-Help!
-Go!

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:15.958
Let me go!

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:22.000
Help!

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:26.041
-Come on!
-Help!

01:12:26.125 --> 01:12:27.875
-Let me go!
-Go!

01:12:38.333 --> 01:12:39.708
You have no shame!

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:43.375
Come here!

01:12:44.625 --> 01:12:45.958
Forgive me.

01:12:46.041 --> 01:12:47.416
Don't do it again.

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:50.333
You have no shame.

01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:54.250
Forgive me.

01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:56.791
Forgive me.

01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:06.250
Not me.

01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:07.958
It's not our fault.

01:13:09.333 --> 01:13:10.416
Die!

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.250
-Burn him!
-Come on!

01:13:17.333 --> 01:13:21.041
-Go!
-Let him burn!

01:13:21.625 --> 01:13:25.208
-Help!
-Burn him!

01:13:25.291 --> 01:13:28.333
-Don't burn me!
-Let him burn!

01:13:28.416 --> 01:13:29.958
-Burn him!
-Damn you!

01:13:30.041 --> 01:13:31.583
-I'll burn you!
-Burn him!

01:13:31.666 --> 01:13:33.875
-Let's go!
-Burn him!

01:13:34.875 --> 01:13:38.000
-Don't burn me.
-Burn.

01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:40.250
-Burn him! Just kill him! Burn!
-Burn!

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.583
-Bastard! He's a traitor!
-A traitor!

01:13:42.666 --> 01:13:47.541
-Burn him!
-Help!

01:13:47.625 --> 01:13:49.708
-Help!
-Just let him burn!

01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:00.500
Die!

01:14:00.583 --> 01:14:02.125
Take that!

01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:03.375
-Come on!
-Burn!

01:14:03.458 --> 01:14:04.833
-Yeah!
-Burn him!

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:48.875
Kenar.

01:14:52.166 --> 01:14:53.166
Kenar.

01:14:58.625 --> 01:14:59.625
Let's go.

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:29.291
Ready?

01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:33.416
Ready…

01:15:33.916 --> 01:15:35.166
Ready for what?

01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:42.208
Okay.

01:15:47.583 --> 01:15:49.750
You will lie down there.

01:15:55.875 --> 01:15:57.333
Me?

01:15:57.916 --> 01:15:58.833
Yes.

01:16:00.416 --> 01:16:02.500
Calm down, okay? Come on.

01:16:04.125 --> 01:16:05.166
It's okay.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.541
You sit here.

01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:40.458
-Kenar. Run, Kenar.
-Shut up!

01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:42.125
What do you want?

01:16:42.208 --> 01:16:43.333
Kenar. Run!

01:16:43.916 --> 01:16:45.458
-Run!
-Hey, Kenar!

01:16:45.541 --> 01:16:46.750
Kenar!

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:48.250
Don't let her get away!

01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:50.291
Stop!

01:16:50.375 --> 01:16:51.541
Run!

01:16:51.625 --> 01:16:53.375
Let me go.

01:16:56.250 --> 01:16:58.083
Hey! Stop!

01:16:59.708 --> 01:17:01.666
Hey! Stop!

01:17:03.416 --> 01:17:05.416
Hey! Stop!

01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:17.708
Huh?

01:17:18.375 --> 01:17:21.166
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.250
Where are you, child?

01:17:38.875 --> 01:17:40.166
Where are you, child?

01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:53.500
Sir…

01:17:54.916 --> 01:17:56.958
I think she's over there.

01:17:57.458 --> 01:17:58.666
Really?

01:17:59.166 --> 01:18:00.208
Yes.

01:18:07.041 --> 01:18:10.750
Tonight is the night of death.

01:18:10.833 --> 01:18:14.250
One life is ready to be offered.

01:18:14.333 --> 01:18:17.625
Tonight is the night of life.

01:18:17.708 --> 01:18:20.916
A thousand lives to save.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.500
Tonight is the night of death.

01:18:24.583 --> 01:18:27.208
One life is ready to be offered.

01:18:27.875 --> 01:18:31.250
Tonight is the night of life.

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:34.250
A thousand lives to save.

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:37.958
Tonight is the night of death.

01:18:38.458 --> 01:18:41.708
-One life is ready to be offered.
-Let me go.

01:18:41.791 --> 01:18:44.166
-Tonight is the night of life.
-Help!

01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:47.791
-Kenar!
-A thousand lives to save.

01:18:47.875 --> 01:18:48.875
Let me go.

01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:52.000
Kenar, run!

01:19:03.583 --> 01:19:06.083
Help.

01:19:09.333 --> 01:19:10.875
You're outrageous, Adi.

01:19:10.958 --> 01:19:12.666
No…

01:19:15.833 --> 01:19:17.791
I've been silent all this time.

01:19:18.791 --> 01:19:20.583
You think I don't know

01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:26.125
that you were the one who slandered Banyu

01:19:26.208 --> 01:19:27.583
and me?

01:19:30.583 --> 01:19:33.958
Banyu wasn't a bad person!

01:19:35.375 --> 01:19:38.291
He protected the villagers.

01:19:38.916 --> 01:19:42.666
He always cared for your children.

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:45.875
Banyu did nothing wrong!

01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:48.875
Adi is the one who deserves to die.

01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:52.583
He poisoned the villagers.

01:20:03.458 --> 01:20:04.875
And you, Dirja.

01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:08.166
Yes, you!

01:20:10.375 --> 01:20:12.750
How could you, Dirja?

01:20:12.833 --> 01:20:16.291
You let all this happen.

01:20:17.041 --> 01:20:19.833
You don't have a heart.

01:20:20.708 --> 01:20:26.041
You let your sister die
because of this curse ritual.

01:20:26.541 --> 01:20:27.625
Prastomo!

01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:29.333
Enough.

01:20:35.416 --> 01:20:36.916
Damn you!

01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:42.875
You will meet your brother.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.958
No!

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.541
Let me go.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.458
No.

01:21:13.125 --> 01:21:14.291
Carry on.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:22.666
-Tonight is the night of death.
-Let me go, please.

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:25.791
-One life is ready to be offered.
-Please let me go.

01:21:25.875 --> 01:21:29.625
Tonight is the night of life.

01:21:29.708 --> 01:21:32.875
A thousand lives to save.

01:21:32.958 --> 01:21:36.291
Tonight is the night of death.

01:21:36.375 --> 01:21:38.250
We pay our respects to our ancestors.

01:21:39.666 --> 01:21:42.875
The time has come.

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:46.833
Come…

01:21:46.916 --> 01:21:50.458
and party with me.

01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:55.916
I ask for protection,

01:21:56.833 --> 01:22:00.458
and I will serve you.

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:05.541
On this night of death,

01:22:05.625 --> 01:22:09.458
one life has been prepared.

01:22:09.541 --> 01:22:13.875
Tonight is the night of life.

01:22:14.541 --> 01:22:19.541
A thousand lives to save.

01:22:27.416 --> 01:22:28.458
Kenar.

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:30.875
Kenar.

01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:33.458
Dance!

01:22:35.208 --> 01:22:36.333
Kenar!

01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:41.750
Please!

01:22:48.958 --> 01:22:51.125
Dance!

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.333
Dance.

01:23:27.041 --> 01:23:28.500
Narik Sukmo.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.333
Stop dancing!

01:23:58.125 --> 01:23:59.250
Stop dancing!

01:24:11.875 --> 01:24:13.791
Stop dancing!

01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:30.416
You dare to fight me?

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.458
Come on!

01:25:38.958 --> 01:25:41.875
Help!

01:25:57.666 --> 01:25:59.166
Thank you, Kenar.

01:25:59.666 --> 01:26:01.250
You've helped us.

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:05.958
Dance. Don't stop.

01:26:12.541 --> 01:26:16.458
Kenar.

01:26:17.833 --> 01:26:18.875
Hey, wake up.

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:21.208
Kenar.

01:26:22.125 --> 01:26:23.083
Kenar.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:25.541
Wake up, Kenar.

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:29.041
Get up.

01:26:34.666 --> 01:26:35.625
Kenar.

01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:39.333
You…

01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:57.125
Uncle…

01:26:57.958 --> 01:27:00.250
Uncle…

01:27:00.333 --> 01:27:01.750
Uncle. Hang on, Uncle.

01:27:01.833 --> 01:27:03.125
Hey…

01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:07.500
-Uncle…
-Take care of Ayu for me.

01:27:07.583 --> 01:27:09.125
No, Uncle.

01:27:09.208 --> 01:27:10.875
Uncle, I beg you.

01:27:10.958 --> 01:27:13.500
-There's nothing
-Uncle…

01:27:15.083 --> 01:27:18.916
that she needs to be afraid of now.

01:27:23.125 --> 01:27:23.958
No…

01:27:24.041 --> 01:27:25.041
It's all…

01:27:30.583 --> 01:27:32.000
No!

01:27:33.666 --> 01:27:35.541
No.

01:27:37.041 --> 01:27:38.958
Uncle. No, Uncle.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.166
No!

01:27:56.791 --> 01:27:59.916
PRASTOMO, SON OF TJOKRO SUDJIWO
BORN: 2/6/1976 - DIED: 11/4/2024

01:28:03.166 --> 01:28:04.333
Let's go, Mom.

01:28:04.833 --> 01:28:06.458
The hatred was born

01:28:07.041 --> 01:28:10.541
because Mr. Adicandra
secretly liked Ratih Mahyu.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:17.250
The villagers had the heart
to parade Banyu.

01:28:19.875 --> 01:28:23.000
A 20-year grudge.

01:28:23.666 --> 01:28:28.875
Because they, Ratih Mahyu and Banyu…

01:28:31.083 --> 01:28:31.958
were separated

01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:34.541
without them having
the chance to be together.

01:28:47.833 --> 01:28:51.375
KELAWANGIN VILLAGE

01:29:06.250 --> 01:29:08.375
Kenar, come on. Hurry up.

01:29:08.458 --> 01:29:09.750
Yes, I'm coming!

01:30:16.083 --> 01:30:18.500
Wait… Dirja.

01:30:19.041 --> 01:30:20.166
Where are you going?

01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:24.583
She's asking a question.
Get a little closer.

01:30:33.833 --> 01:30:35.333
I'm planning to go to Yogya.

01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:43.166
There's no one else here for me,
so why should I be here?

01:30:45.625 --> 01:30:46.666
So…

01:30:47.458 --> 01:30:49.541
who do you have in Yogya?

01:30:52.708 --> 01:30:54.750
A future I'm looking for.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:01.458
Gosh, a future!

01:31:07.958 --> 01:31:09.791
Hey, let's go.
