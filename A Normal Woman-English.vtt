00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:21.500
When I was just a little girl

2
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.375
I asked my mother, "What will I be?"

3
00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:31.625
"Will I be pretty?"

4
00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:34.333
"Will I be rich?"

5
00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:39.333
Here's what she said to me

6
00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:43.791
"Que será, será"

7
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.291
"Whatever will be will be"

8
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:55.166
"The future's not ours to see"

9
00:00:55.833 --> 00:01:00.541
"Que será, será"

10
00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:07.416
"Que será, será"

11
00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:13.166
"Whatever will be will be"

12
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:18.625
"The future's not ours to see"

13
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:24.125
"Que será, será"

14
00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:31.833
"What will be will be"

15
00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:37.875
Good morning, ma'am.

16
00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:43.583
-Irah.
-Yes?

17
00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:45.166
I didn't order flowers.

18
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.000
Madam ordered them.

19
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:05.125
And look over here. One, two, three.

20
00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:07.708
Over here. One, two, three.

21
00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:12.416
Sorry, Jonathan, sir.
Can you move the cup down a bit?

22
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.375
Oh, like that?

23
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.541
Okay.

24
00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:19.958
Oh, Angel, honey, can you smile, please?

25
00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:25.125
All right,
going for another. One, two, three.

26
00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.416
Perfect. Oh.

27
00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:32.125
Okay, Grandma,
can you sit up a little bit?

28
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.333
I am sitting up.

29
00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:38.875
These flowers are covering
your face. Here.

30
00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:39.833
No, no, no.

31
00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:41.875
Just move the camera

32
00:05:43.458 --> 00:05:45.125
Ah. Yeah, okay, move the camera.

33
00:05:55.458 --> 00:05:58.291
All right, uh, let's try over here.

34
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.958
Okay.

35
00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:05.250
One, two, three.

36
00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.875
Jonathan, how do you feel
about being chosen

37
00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.458
as the cover of our annual family issue?

38
00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:14.291
Well, I'm proud.

39
00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:17.625
We… We didn't grow up with privilege.

40
00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:19.416
We're not old money.

41
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:23.041
Everything we have is through hard work.

42
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:28.625
Can you tell us a bit about
how you and your family got to this point?

43
00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:31.791
Well, I can say

44
00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:35.041
that I wouldn't be here without my mother.

45
00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:37.333
A strong foundation,

46
00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:38.958
she gave me that.

47
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:42.333
Also, truth and honesty,

48
00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:44.625
they're my guiding values.

49
00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:49.500
May I say
you have the most beautiful family.

50
00:06:50.416 --> 00:06:51.375
And wife.

51
00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:53.708
How did you two meet?

52
00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:55.458
At church.

53
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.541
Well, sir, I go to church every week,

54
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.625
but is it that easy?

55
00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:05.083
I haven't met someone like you.

56
00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.916
Knock, and it shall be opened to you.

57
00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:15.500
The first time I saw her
decorating the church so beautifully,

58
00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:18.375
I knew she would be the perfect wife.

59
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:22.333
Even though she came
from a humble background,

60
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:25.916
for me and our family,
it was never an issue.

61
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.750
I saw potential in her.

62
00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:29.250
And I was right.

63
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.625
She makes me
the luckiest man in the world.

64
00:07:33.666 --> 00:07:36.083
And, Milla, how do you feel

65
00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:38.833
to have everything
that women could ever dream of?

66
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:41.833
I feel blessed, of course.

67
00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:44.708
This is everything to me.

68
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.875
Irah,

69
00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.875
can you please take the salmon
out of the freezer at ten o'clock

70
00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.791
and steam it for Madam's lunch?

71
00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:22.875
Yeah.

72
00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:28.625
Irah, where's the liver?

73
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:30.541
Oh God, I forgot.

74
00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:32.791
What? Irah, I told you this.

75
00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:36.958
Madam specifically asked for liver
with her steamed eggs.

76
00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:39.125
But is Madam allowed to eat liver?

77
00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:43.541
If her cholesterol's high,
you'll get the blame again.

78
00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:48.875
Okay, then maybe
just replace it with mincemeat. Quickly.

79
00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:49.791
Yes, miss.

80
00:11:00.208 --> 00:11:03.208
Mom, I can't ask Jonathan again.

81
00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:06.083
Don't you have any money of your own?

82
00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.083
This is an emergency, Milla.

83
00:11:08.708 --> 00:11:12.125
What about your monthly allowance?

84
00:11:12.833 --> 00:11:14.541
It's only the 4th of the month.

85
00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:17.125
So, what do you want?
Do you want me to beg?

86
00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:19.500
You're my only child, Milla.

87
00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:22.416
Who else am I supposed to turn to?

88
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.708
How can she quit gambling
if you're not firm with her?

89
00:11:31.875 --> 00:11:33.375
I know.

90
00:11:34.833 --> 00:11:36.125
But she's my mom.

91
00:11:37.333 --> 00:11:39.791
My mother is suspicious already.

92
00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:41.666
All your extra spending.

93
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.916
If she finds out… I have no choice
but to tell her the truth.

94
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.875
No.

95
00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:47.416
Please.

96
00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.291
Mil, my mother and I
have done enough for her.

97
00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.125
It's okay. I'll talk to my mom.

98
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.500
Honey, have you taken
your Eternity Life this morning?

99
00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:19.416
I haven't.

100
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.833
Take some. You know
how beneficial they are.

101
00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:26.666
Now, for me, Men's Essentials
for immune, stamina, and brain function.

102
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.708
And for you?

103
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:32.625
Flawless Beauty for skin hydration,
anti-wrinkle, and anti-aging.

104
00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:35.458
Have a blessed and healthy day,
my Eternity Life family.

105
00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:36.416
Bye-bye.

106
00:12:56.541 --> 00:12:58.291
Mother, as you requested,

107
00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:01.375
I've replaced the flowers
for your birthday.

108
00:13:02.041 --> 00:13:05.250
The revision of the cake design
will be emailed next week.

109
00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:07.583
It's taking too long.

110
00:13:07.666 --> 00:13:09.583
Yes, Mother. I'll chase them up.

111
00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:13.291
Oh, and I've also booked
the makeup artist.

112
00:13:14.458 --> 00:13:15.291
Cancel them.

113
00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:19.333
I've found someone much better.

114
00:13:19.416 --> 00:13:20.916
But I've paid already.

115
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.041
Mil, it's her birthday. Let her decide.

116
00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:26.791
Angel can also get her makeup done.

117
00:13:27.583 --> 00:13:30.583
This woman has a talent
for making people's faces look

118
00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:32.541
thinner.

119
00:13:52.458 --> 00:13:53.291
What's wrong?

120
00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:54.833
Mom?

121
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:57.125
Mil?

122
00:13:57.791 --> 00:14:01.291
I forgot to buy the liver,
so I used mincemeat.

123
00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:02.791
Sorry, Mother.

124
00:14:03.916 --> 00:14:06.416
All right. Get liver for tomorrow.

125
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.833
No need. I've lost my appetite.

126
00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:10.083
Drama queen.

127
00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:12.625
Angel, don't speak like that
to your grandma.

128
00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:21.916
You…

129
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.583
You're always too soft on your daughter.

130
00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:30.833
I'll fix this.

131
00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:45.666
Hey.

132
00:14:48.208 --> 00:14:49.250
What's going on?

133
00:14:53.583 --> 00:14:54.666
Angie.

134
00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:56.708
I'm fine, Mom.

135
00:14:57.416 --> 00:14:58.708
Just leave me alone.

136
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:00.541
Give me your phone, please.

137
00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:04.041
Come on.

138
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.833
Can you believe I made this
handbag from my grandma's old sweater?

139
00:15:12.916 --> 00:15:14.708
Upcycle is chic, guys.

140
00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:17.833
If you want to know the process
behind the making of this handbag,

141
00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:20.625
please let me know in the comments. Bye!

142
00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:25.791
YOU SHOULD UPCYCLE YOUR FACE
INSTEAD OF YOUR BAG

143
00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:27.333
COVER YOUR FACE WITH THAT BAG!

144
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.375
Well, I think this bag is so rad.

145
00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:38.000
Can I use it?

146
00:15:39.791 --> 00:15:40.791
Just don't.

147
00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:43.333
Angie,

148
00:15:44.291 --> 00:15:47.416
you're a talented and strong girl.

149
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:51.083
You're so much more
than those stupid comments.

150
00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:53.708
You know, I could never
make a bag like that.

151
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:55.416
You don't need to.

152
00:15:56.625 --> 00:15:59.041
I mean, look at you.

153
00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:09.750
Grandma suggested this.

154
00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:25.416
Mm. No!

155
00:16:26.166 --> 00:16:28.166
-Just a little fix.
-No! No.

156
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.166
Mom!

157
00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:34.291
I just want to feel pretty!
I can't live with this face anymore.

158
00:16:36.916 --> 00:16:38.250
I don't agree.

159
00:16:38.333 --> 00:16:42.083
Angel is too young
to be encouraged to get plastic surgery.

160
00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:55.250
IS SHE THEIR BIOLOGICAL CHILD?
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST

161
00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:58.041
Don't you feel sorry for your own child?

162
00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:18.708
So, how's Angel doing, Milla?

163
00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:22.458
Mil?

164
00:18:23.458 --> 00:18:25.333
How's Angel doing?

165
00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:28.041
Oh. All right.

166
00:18:28.625 --> 00:18:30.750
I just hope
she doesn't pay attention to it.

167
00:18:30.833 --> 00:18:33.208
-Mm.
-She's so talented.

168
00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:36.083
Here, look. She made this.

169
00:18:36.166 --> 00:18:42.708
Oh, that explains it. We were wondering
where on earth you got that bag.

170
00:18:42.791 --> 00:18:44.458
It was made by Angel.

171
00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:46.041
Oh.

172
00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:49.083
You know, if you want to be
in the public eye,

173
00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:51.166
then you need to be prepared
for things like this.

174
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.291
Mm.

175
00:18:52.375 --> 00:18:55.791
Anyway, Angel makes your family look real.

176
00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:59.500
And more approachable
for the Eternity Life brand.

177
00:18:59.583 --> 00:19:00.875
What do you mean?

178
00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:04.500
And to be on the cover
of High Lane Magazine,

179
00:19:04.583 --> 00:19:06.125
you guys must have made it.

180
00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:09.708
Yeah, Mil,
you're the ultimate couple, right?

181
00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:13.875
Just look at Jon, her husband. Ooh!

182
00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:18.208
Watching him lift weights
on his Instagram live…

183
00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:20.750
I wish I was that barbell!

184
00:19:23.083 --> 00:19:26.375
If he were my husband, oh, I tell you…

185
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:30.583
-Hi, hi!
-Hi, baby.

186
00:19:30.666 --> 00:19:31.916
-Hi.
-Hi there.

187
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.625
-Hey.
-Hello.

188
00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:36.750
-Milla, you just keep getting younger.
-Oh, hi.

189
00:19:36.833 --> 00:19:38.291
-Mrs. Nugros.
-Hi.

190
00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:40.625
-Have you lost weight?
-Oh, stop it.

191
00:19:40.708 --> 00:19:41.708
I'm serious.

192
00:19:41.791 --> 00:19:47.208
You should show Mr. Nugros your tricks
so he stays young forever.

193
00:19:47.291 --> 00:19:50.000
Uh, am I not young enough for you?

194
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.250
Of course you are.

195
00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:54.458
And, Jon, congratulations.

196
00:19:54.541 --> 00:19:57.666
-I heard sales are skyrocketing.
-Oh, thank you.

197
00:19:58.208 --> 00:20:05.000
You know, I've always said that the face
of Eternity Life should be our CEO.

198
00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:07.125
Walk the talk.

199
00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:10.625
No need to pay for influencers.
Am I right?

200
00:20:10.708 --> 00:20:13.500
Absolutely. He sure convinced me.

201
00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:15.875
I bought everything all at once.

202
00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:17.291
Wow.

203
00:20:17.875 --> 00:20:21.708
Mil, I invited Mr. Nugros and his family
to Mother's birthday.

204
00:20:21.791 --> 00:20:23.583
Who's the event organizer?

205
00:20:23.666 --> 00:20:25.083
Mil is doing everything.

206
00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:27.375
Mil.

207
00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:28.875
Milla.

208
00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:30.250
Milla.

209
00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:34.083
-Mil?
-Milla?

210
00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:21.791
Grace!

211
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.375
Milla, what's happening?

212
00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:31.916
It's blood! Blood!

213
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.500
-There's no blood.
-Grace!

214
00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:35.958
Milla, calm down! There's no blood.

215
00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:38.333
Nothing's there.

216
00:21:53.791 --> 00:21:55.958
Milla's never been like this before.

217
00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.041
CBC and CRP are normal.

218
00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:03.208
There's no inflammation
or infection detected.

219
00:22:03.291 --> 00:22:06.250
You're okay, Milla.
You don't have allergies, right?

220
00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:07.333
None at all.

221
00:22:07.416 --> 00:22:09.333
-A change in diet?
-No.

222
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.250
Any pets?

223
00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:12.250
No, none.

224
00:22:12.333 --> 00:22:14.083
Then it's most likely that

225
00:22:15.291 --> 00:22:16.708
Milla is stressed.

226
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:20.041
But how does that explain it?

227
00:22:20.125 --> 00:22:24.375
Well, stress and fatigue
can cause people to hallucinate.

228
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.708
I'm not stressed.

229
00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:31.458
Don't be too worried.

230
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:34.750
What's important right now
is for Milla to take it easy.

231
00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:37.208
I'll prescribe some ointment
and medication.

232
00:22:37.291 --> 00:22:39.583
So, you think it will heal quickly?

233
00:22:40.166 --> 00:22:43.000
It's m-my mother's
birthday party coming up.

234
00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:44.791
Just relax.

235
00:22:44.875 --> 00:22:47.541
Milla is going to be fine.

236
00:22:48.125 --> 00:22:49.000
Thanks, doctor.

237
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.541
Who are you?

238
00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:39.375
I'm Hatta. Irah's son. I'm new on staff.

239
00:23:39.458 --> 00:23:40.791
Right. Hatta.

240
00:23:41.541 --> 00:23:42.750
The new gardener.

241
00:23:42.833 --> 00:23:45.125
So, we pay for his schooling
and now he's a gardener?

242
00:23:45.208 --> 00:23:46.166
Jon.

243
00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:49.833
I hope you'll like it here.

244
00:24:06.166 --> 00:24:10.416
May your words guide us
as we journey through life.

245
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.916
-Amen.
-Amen.

246
00:24:32.791 --> 00:24:34.500
"Let those who seek wisdom

247
00:24:35.083 --> 00:24:37.000
be told when they are wrong,

248
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.833
for it is through humility

249
00:24:40.458 --> 00:24:41.458
that we learn."

250
00:24:45.625 --> 00:24:48.875
"A devoted wife
is the crown of her husband."

251
00:24:50.666 --> 00:24:52.541
"She who dishonors him…

252
00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:59.875
Is like a burden unto his heart and soul."

253
00:25:05.583 --> 00:25:06.958
I make you happy, right?

254
00:25:07.916 --> 00:25:08.875
Of course.

255
00:25:10.875 --> 00:25:11.791
Good.

256
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.791
I want you to be happy.

257
00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:19.208
And I want you to get better.

258
00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:22.916
Yeah.

259
00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:05.791
I'm sorry about today.

260
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.291
I won't embarrass you again.

261
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:51.791
You need some rest.

262
00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:56.958
Miss.

263
00:27:58.541 --> 00:27:59.416
Miss.

264
00:28:00.708 --> 00:28:01.583
Miss?

265
00:28:03.083 --> 00:28:03.916
Miss?

266
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.541
Are you not well?

267
00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:13.000
Oh no!

268
00:28:21.708 --> 00:28:22.625
Milla.

269
00:28:27.833 --> 00:28:30.625
You've kept us all waiting.

270
00:28:32.333 --> 00:28:33.458
Yes, Mother.

271
00:28:44.416 --> 00:28:49.041
So the decorations we designed
are inspired by the Ming dynasty.

272
00:28:49.125 --> 00:28:53.291
We'll be using a color palette
of deep calming blue and pure white.

273
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.750
The main centerpiece is the birthday cake.

274
00:28:57.375 --> 00:29:01.166
This will be backdropped
by a painting of a mountain landscape.

275
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.208
Next--

276
00:29:03.583 --> 00:29:04.583
Where are you going?

277
00:29:05.458 --> 00:29:06.666
I need to, um,

278
00:29:07.416 --> 00:29:09.166
take my medicine.

279
00:29:13.875 --> 00:29:14.958
Go on.

280
00:29:15.833 --> 00:29:17.208
In this area…

281
00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:29.750
Mom?

282
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.458
Are you okay?

283
00:29:42.708 --> 00:29:44.291
Mom! Oh!

284
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:53.916
Mom?

285
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.041
Mom!

286
00:29:57.125 --> 00:29:57.958
Mom!

287
00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:02.500
Mom!

288
00:30:03.375 --> 00:30:04.250
Mom?

289
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:07.875
Mom.

290
00:30:11.166 --> 00:30:12.000
Mom?

291
00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:22.708
There's something wrong with me.

292
00:30:22.791 --> 00:30:24.541
The doctor said it's just reflux.

293
00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:27.458
Because you took your medicine
on an empty stomach.

294
00:30:27.541 --> 00:30:29.958
No, but I vomited glass.

295
00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:34.666
What are you talking about?
There's no glass.

296
00:30:36.125 --> 00:30:37.833
And that girl…

297
00:30:38.541 --> 00:30:39.416
What girl, Mom?

298
00:30:40.666 --> 00:30:41.791
Her face…

299
00:30:41.875 --> 00:30:43.166
Her face was

300
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.958
full of glass.

301
00:30:46.041 --> 00:30:48.583
Milla, you're being paranoid.
There's no girl.

302
00:30:50.083 --> 00:30:51.375
It's just a rash, okay?

303
00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:54.625
Can't you just believe me this one time?

304
00:30:55.458 --> 00:31:00.208
This is because you rarely go to church.

305
00:31:02.208 --> 00:31:05.500
The forces of darkness are corrupting you.

306
00:31:07.791 --> 00:31:08.791
Enough of this!

307
00:31:09.291 --> 00:31:10.541
Take your medicine.

308
00:31:11.083 --> 00:31:12.458
Then we will pray.

309
00:31:15.125 --> 00:31:16.875
Our Lord Jesus Christ,

310
00:31:17.416 --> 00:31:20.041
have mercy on your humble servant, Milla.

311
00:31:22.833 --> 00:31:27.083
Shield her from the temptation
of the devil that weakens her faith,

312
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.833
and forgive her sins
that have disappointed you.

313
00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:36.125
Holy Spirit, dwell within her.

314
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.416
May she be reborn

315
00:31:39.458 --> 00:31:43.083
in your grace,
obedient and faithful to your will.

316
00:31:44.125 --> 00:31:48.416
In the name of our Lord Jesus,
we give thanks. Amen.

317
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:45.625
Grace.

318
00:32:52.791 --> 00:32:53.791
Grace.

319
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.208
Grace.

320
00:33:42.666 --> 00:33:43.750
Milla?

321
00:33:43.833 --> 00:33:46.250
Milla?

322
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.291
Another bad dream?

323
00:33:54.583 --> 00:33:55.666
Your face.

324
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:56.750
Huh?

325
00:33:57.375 --> 00:33:58.458
Your face.

326
00:34:16.333 --> 00:34:17.458
How can

327
00:34:19.291 --> 00:34:21.083
the rash spread this quickly?

328
00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.291
It was only her neck yesterday.

329
00:34:26.375 --> 00:34:29.541
Well, Milla's had all kinds of tests.
The results are normal.

330
00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:31.500
It's not autoimmune.

331
00:34:31.583 --> 00:34:33.708
But we're gonna get
a second opinion. Okay?

332
00:34:33.791 --> 00:34:36.125
It's strange it's happened so fast.

333
00:34:38.875 --> 00:34:40.000
The doctor said

334
00:34:40.916 --> 00:34:42.125
it's psychological.

335
00:34:43.125 --> 00:34:44.416
You're stressed?

336
00:34:45.958 --> 00:34:47.875
What are you so stressed about?

337
00:34:48.458 --> 00:34:50.166
Taking care of the household?

338
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.250
-Taking care of this family?
-No.

339
00:34:52.833 --> 00:34:55.166
Organizing my birthday party?

340
00:34:56.625 --> 00:34:58.458
If you can't take the pressure,

341
00:34:58.541 --> 00:35:00.666
just hire an event organizer.

342
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:01.958
It's not that.

343
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.416
Then what?

344
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.708
It's clear

345
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.916
you're ungrateful for all of this.

346
00:35:15.708 --> 00:35:19.208
If you were grateful,
then you would not get stressed

347
00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:21.291
What more do you need?

348
00:35:21.375 --> 00:35:24.625
And we take care of your mother.
We even bought her a house.

349
00:35:24.708 --> 00:35:26.000
I never asked.

350
00:35:27.916 --> 00:35:31.541
I never asked for that house.

351
00:35:33.375 --> 00:35:34.625
I'll tell you this.

352
00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:40.041
If you had never met my family,

353
00:35:40.125 --> 00:35:41.416
there is no way

354
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.750
that you would be living
such a comfortable life like you are now.

355
00:35:46.708 --> 00:35:48.625
We've given you everything, Mil.

356
00:35:55.375 --> 00:35:56.250
Irah!

357
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:11.541
What is this?

358
00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:14.333
It's a healing broth. Madam made it.

359
00:36:20.916 --> 00:36:21.750
Eat up.

360
00:36:21.833 --> 00:36:22.666
No.

361
00:36:23.416 --> 00:36:24.500
Mil, eat.

362
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.208
Stop trying to force her.

363
00:36:47.166 --> 00:36:49.166
It's good for your skin.

364
00:37:49.791 --> 00:37:50.833
Mom?

365
00:37:52.958 --> 00:37:53.875
Mom!

366
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:58.583
Mom!

367
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:29.041
I know it smells strong,
but it really works.

368
00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:31.291
Since your mom was little,

369
00:38:31.791 --> 00:38:35.333
if she ever had an itch or allergy,

370
00:38:35.416 --> 00:38:37.291
this would always cure her.

371
00:38:39.416 --> 00:38:41.416
Why can't I remember my childhood?

372
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.750
How's that even possible?

373
00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:47.625
Oh, no need to remember.

374
00:38:47.708 --> 00:38:50.625
The important thing
is that you're happy now.

375
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.708
Was she not happy before?

376
00:38:53.791 --> 00:38:57.333
Well, back then,
her life wasn't like it is now.

377
00:38:57.833 --> 00:39:02.625
I remember one Christmas,
your mom got scolded by Grandma Novi.

378
00:39:02.708 --> 00:39:03.541
Why?

379
00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:07.875
It was because of a headband
she wanted to wear to church.

380
00:39:07.958 --> 00:39:10.583
Really? Just because of a headband?

381
00:39:10.666 --> 00:39:13.250
Yes. She even cried.

382
00:39:13.333 --> 00:39:15.750
"Irah, it's not fair."

383
00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:19.583
"Why does Mom always forbid Grace
from feeling beautiful?"

384
00:39:19.666 --> 00:39:21.708
-"She's always so angry."
-Grace?

385
00:39:22.208 --> 00:39:23.041
Hm?

386
00:39:25.083 --> 00:39:26.750
Why did you call me Grace?

387
00:39:26.833 --> 00:39:27.916
Who's Grace?

388
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.833
Uh…

389
00:39:29.458 --> 00:39:31.708
-Oh, I'm old. I must be talking nonsense.
-Wait.

390
00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:33.416
Is there something you're not telling me?

391
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.583
-No. Nothing, miss.
-Please no more lying.

392
00:39:35.666 --> 00:39:37.125
I'm not lying to you.

393
00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:39.791
Grace keeps appearing in my dreams!

394
00:39:40.416 --> 00:39:44.875
Miss, you must stop
thinking such strange things.

395
00:39:58.083 --> 00:39:59.625
What's going on with you?

396
00:40:00.208 --> 00:40:02.791
Showing up in the middle of the night,
rummaging through my things.

397
00:40:04.416 --> 00:40:05.291
Hey!

398
00:40:06.041 --> 00:40:07.166
Hey!

399
00:40:08.666 --> 00:40:10.083
Your face, what happened?

400
00:40:10.166 --> 00:40:12.208
Mom, why was I called Grace?

401
00:40:12.291 --> 00:40:13.250
Grace?

402
00:40:14.541 --> 00:40:15.416
Who's Grace?

403
00:40:16.416 --> 00:40:18.166
Mom, stop lying!

404
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.666
What are you talking about?

405
00:40:24.416 --> 00:40:26.583
She's not Grace. She's not Grace.

406
00:40:27.166 --> 00:40:29.333
-She's not Grace.
-Of course not.

407
00:40:31.166 --> 00:40:33.333
This is all you, Milla.

408
00:40:37.166 --> 00:40:41.833
Mom, where's the rest
of the photos from my childhood?

409
00:40:43.291 --> 00:40:45.416
Well, I couldn't bring
everything from Surabaya.

410
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.291
Then who is Grace?!

411
00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:48.916
Mil.

412
00:40:49.666 --> 00:40:51.500
Did you call Jonathan?

413
00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:55.791
Jon, she's rambling
about some child called Grace.

414
00:40:55.875 --> 00:40:58.000
-Let's go home.
-No! I need to find her.

415
00:40:58.083 --> 00:40:59.333
-Find who?
-Grace!

416
00:40:59.416 --> 00:41:02.000
Mil, you're not well. You're acting crazy.

417
00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:04.458
-Maybe I am crazy!
-There's no Grace.

418
00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:06.625
It's all in your head.

419
00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:44.041
Ma'am.

420
00:41:44.833 --> 00:41:45.791
Are you okay?

421
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.041
Am I really going crazy?

422
00:43:47.416 --> 00:43:48.416
Milla.

423
00:43:50.083 --> 00:43:51.000
Milla.

424
00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:54.125
Mommy?

425
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.083
Don't worry.

426
00:44:07.666 --> 00:44:09.958
I'll make it better, I promise.

427
00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:28.333
In the name of Jesus Christ,

428
00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:32.208
we cleanse this soul
once tarnished by evil,

429
00:44:32.833 --> 00:44:35.625
and lead home the lost lamb of God.

430
00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.500
I baptize you with water,

431
00:44:39.083 --> 00:44:42.041
but he will baptize you
with the Holy Spirit.

432
00:44:50.291 --> 00:44:51.208
Holy Spirit,

433
00:44:52.083 --> 00:44:56.291
deliver Milla from the shackles
and punishment of her sins.

434
00:44:59.291 --> 00:45:00.833
God has saved us!

435
00:45:01.625 --> 00:45:05.083
He has saved us
through the washing of rebirth

436
00:45:05.166 --> 00:45:08.500
and the renewing power of the Holy Spirit.

437
00:45:48.666 --> 00:45:51.916
Mom!

438
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.666
-Milla. Milla!
-Milla.

439
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.333
What did you do to Grace?

440
00:45:55.416 --> 00:45:57.458
-Milla!
-What happened to her?

441
00:45:57.541 --> 00:45:59.625
-Father, help her
-Help my daughter!

442
00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:02.208
Dear God, deliver this soul!

443
00:46:02.291 --> 00:46:04.208
Mom!

444
00:46:04.291 --> 00:46:06.250
-Angel!
-Mom!

445
00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:08.416
-Mom!
-What did you do to Grace, huh?

446
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:09.958
-Mom!
-Tell me!

447
00:46:10.041 --> 00:46:12.208
It's okay. It's okay, Mom.

448
00:46:12.791 --> 00:46:14.458
Come on. It's all right.

449
00:46:14.541 --> 00:46:16.458
Come on. Come on, Mom.

450
00:46:23.666 --> 00:46:25.083
Angel, open the door.

451
00:46:25.166 --> 00:46:27.958
Can I please have
some time with her? Please!

452
00:46:28.041 --> 00:46:30.541
-Angel.
-Mom, what is actually wrong with you?

453
00:46:30.625 --> 00:46:33.250
I don't know. I don't know.

454
00:46:33.333 --> 00:46:35.208
Tell me. Just tell me.

455
00:46:35.291 --> 00:46:38.125
I feel like
there's something missing in me.

456
00:46:40.375 --> 00:46:42.125
Is it… Grace?

457
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:43.875
Who is she?

458
00:46:43.958 --> 00:46:45.958
I think that I am Grace,

459
00:46:46.041 --> 00:46:49.083
but it feels like
everybody is trying to hide it from me.

460
00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:54.625
I know it sounds crazy,
but I don't know who I am anymore.

461
00:46:54.708 --> 00:46:57.541
It's okay. It's okay. I believe you.

462
00:46:59.875 --> 00:47:02.375
Okay. Okay. Okay.

463
00:47:13.375 --> 00:47:14.791
You have to stop.

464
00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:16.375
Milla,

465
00:47:17.416 --> 00:47:18.791
I am begging you.

466
00:47:18.875 --> 00:47:20.125
Please just stop.

467
00:47:20.208 --> 00:47:24.291
Mom, I'll stop
if you tell me the truth right now.

468
00:47:25.166 --> 00:47:29.166
If you keep doing this,
then we could lose everything.

469
00:47:32.708 --> 00:47:34.291
So, that's what's on your mind?

470
00:47:35.833 --> 00:47:39.000
That you wouldn't have enough money
for your comfortable life,

471
00:47:39.083 --> 00:47:39.958
or to keep gambling--

472
00:47:40.041 --> 00:47:42.166
Our life. Our life, our life!

473
00:47:43.916 --> 00:47:46.000
You're the one who's causing the problem.

474
00:47:46.083 --> 00:47:47.083
It's not me.

475
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.625
Have you forgotten
how tough our lives were before?

476
00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:00.958
The Gunawan family
is a blessing from God, Milla.

477
00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:08.750
And we have to hold on to that.

478
00:48:11.708 --> 00:48:14.250
We can't let life defeat us again.

479
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Thank you, sir.

480
00:49:05.375 --> 00:49:06.250
Erika, right?

481
00:49:10.625 --> 00:49:11.708
How did you know?

482
00:49:15.916 --> 00:49:17.750
Come in. My mother is expecting you.

483
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:19.958
Oh, so you're the son.

484
00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:21.708
-Jonathan, yeah?
-Yeah.

485
00:49:22.208 --> 00:49:23.500
-Erika.
-Jonathan.

486
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:25.208
Mm-hmm.

487
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:30.250
Uh, your… your eyes,
you have dark circles under them.

488
00:49:30.333 --> 00:49:32.833
I know a great eye cream
I could recommend.

489
00:49:35.333 --> 00:49:36.958
Uh, let me help with that.

490
00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:39.416
Oh, no, that's okay. I'm used to it.

491
00:49:47.583 --> 00:49:49.125
You're strong. That looks heavy.

492
00:49:51.958 --> 00:49:53.500
All right. I… I should go.

493
00:51:04.625 --> 00:51:07.458
You look absolutely radiant.

494
00:51:08.291 --> 00:51:10.375
Gravity is catching up with me.

495
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:12.416
Stop it!

496
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.250
You know, I've done makeup
for many women your age

497
00:51:16.333 --> 00:51:18.458
and your skin is much tighter.

498
00:51:21.291 --> 00:51:23.458
-For my birthday party--
-Mm-hmm?

499
00:51:23.541 --> 00:51:27.041
I want you to give me a transformation

500
00:51:27.583 --> 00:51:29.000
so they don't recognize me.

501
00:51:29.083 --> 00:51:34.666
Don't worry. I can
turn back time with my touch.

502
00:51:35.833 --> 00:51:36.833
Erika,

503
00:51:37.958 --> 00:51:41.583
do you think
you can do my makeup like this?

504
00:51:43.458 --> 00:51:44.333
Of course.

505
00:51:44.416 --> 00:51:46.041
That's your mom, right?

506
00:51:46.583 --> 00:51:48.791
Will she be joining us for her makeup?

507
00:51:48.875 --> 00:51:49.708
No, she can't.

508
00:51:50.791 --> 00:51:51.625
She's sick.

509
00:51:52.625 --> 00:51:57.000
Oh, well, let me know when she gets better
so I can arrange a makeup test for her.

510
00:51:57.083 --> 00:51:59.208
She won't be attending the party.

511
00:51:59.291 --> 00:52:01.041
She could if you let her.

512
00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:07.083
Angel, I think
that we should film a TikTok video

513
00:52:07.166 --> 00:52:09.125
of your makeup before and after.

514
00:52:09.208 --> 00:52:10.458
It could go viral.

515
00:52:10.541 --> 00:52:13.166
And be humiliated? No, thanks.

516
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:16.125
No need to feed the fish
if you're not ready to catch one.

517
00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:20.583
Oh, is this about the haters?

518
00:52:21.625 --> 00:52:23.958
People online can be so cruel.

519
00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:25.916
Just ignore them, Angel.

520
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.875
You know, it's only
because they're jealous.

521
00:52:30.541 --> 00:52:31.500
Here we go.

522
00:52:33.208 --> 00:52:34.041
Come in.

523
00:52:45.875 --> 00:52:46.916
Irah!

524
00:52:48.041 --> 00:52:49.750
What a surprise to see you!

525
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:51.458
It's Erika.

526
00:52:52.208 --> 00:52:55.791
I was best friends with Grace
back in Surabaya.

527
00:52:55.875 --> 00:52:57.875
You don't work for Grace anymore?

528
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.375
-Grace?
-You've got the wrong person.

529
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:06.125
She's been with Milla
since Milla was a little girl.

530
00:53:08.458 --> 00:53:09.333
Milla?

531
00:53:15.666 --> 00:53:16.541
Erika!

532
00:53:17.208 --> 00:53:19.125
I've got so many likes.

533
00:53:19.208 --> 00:53:20.291
That's great.

534
00:53:21.333 --> 00:53:24.833
I'll show you an easy way
to apply your own makeup next time.

535
00:53:26.458 --> 00:53:31.416
And don't listen to those haters
who say you should get plastic surgery.

536
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.750
Just do what I teach you. It works.

537
00:53:35.291 --> 00:53:36.250
Wait.

538
00:53:36.333 --> 00:53:37.458
Oh my God.

539
00:53:38.041 --> 00:53:41.916
Oh my God! He's, like, really famous
and he's messaging me.

540
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.416
-Yeah!
-What should I reply?

541
00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.666
Just wait, and don't reply straight away.
It'll keep him wanting more.

542
00:53:51.958 --> 00:53:54.458
Erika, thank you so much.

543
00:53:55.208 --> 00:53:58.125
For the first time, I feel really pretty.

544
00:53:58.875 --> 00:53:59.750
Angel…

545
00:54:03.375 --> 00:54:05.291
you're already pretty.

546
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.708
Just like your mom.

547
00:54:16.041 --> 00:54:17.333
She used to be.

548
00:54:19.041 --> 00:54:21.500
Do you know what's causing her to be sick?

549
00:54:25.416 --> 00:54:26.375
My mom,

550
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:31.541
she has been… mentioning the name Grace.

551
00:54:33.791 --> 00:54:35.750
Do you know Grace?

552
00:54:41.875 --> 00:54:43.458
Do you think you can help her?

553
00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:35.125
Who's there?

554
00:55:43.375 --> 00:55:44.208
Who are you?

555
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:47.833
Grace?

556
00:55:52.541 --> 00:55:53.708
You know Grace?

557
00:56:14.166 --> 00:56:15.708
It's Erika.

558
00:56:16.916 --> 00:56:18.375
Do you remember me?

559
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:21.416
Erika…

560
00:56:26.083 --> 00:56:27.000
I…

561
00:56:30.583 --> 00:56:31.416
love…

562
00:56:34.166 --> 00:56:35.000
you.

563
00:57:38.458 --> 00:57:40.166
Does it hurt, Grace?

564
00:57:44.083 --> 00:57:45.166
Do you remember

565
00:57:45.833 --> 00:57:47.500
anything that happened?

566
00:57:51.833 --> 00:57:52.708
It's okay.

567
00:57:53.333 --> 00:57:55.583
What matters is you remember me.

568
00:57:56.625 --> 00:58:01.000
You know, I'm Erika, your best friend.

569
00:58:16.958 --> 00:58:19.333
So, you don't know
what happened to me either?

570
00:58:24.583 --> 00:58:27.791
One day, you and your mom
suddenly left Surabaya.

571
00:58:29.041 --> 00:58:30.875
I never heard from you again.

572
00:58:41.083 --> 00:58:42.125
Will you help me?

573
00:58:44.625 --> 00:58:45.458
Yeah.

574
00:58:49.375 --> 00:58:50.625
I promise

575
00:58:52.458 --> 00:58:55.708
that we'll find out
what really happened, okay?

576
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:05.250
It's a new life.

577
01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:06.166
Huh.

578
01:00:06.833 --> 01:00:07.708
Yeah.

579
01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:09.375
Ma'am.

580
01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:16.833
Geranium.

581
01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:27.958
Can you put this in my room?

582
01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.083
Yes, of course.

583
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:38.875
-Careful of the roots.
-We don't wanna damage them.

584
01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:39.791
Yes.

585
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.791
Are you feeling better?

586
01:01:23.958 --> 01:01:25.666
You know what? Forget about it.

587
01:01:29.916 --> 01:01:33.458
Whatever plant is put
in my room always dies.

588
01:01:33.541 --> 01:01:35.541
It's not the plant's fault, you know?

589
01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:39.958
Maybe it's just…

590
01:01:42.083 --> 01:01:43.458
its surroundings.

591
01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:48.000
Surroundings…

592
01:01:50.166 --> 01:01:51.000
Yeah.

593
01:03:01.416 --> 01:03:03.666
I am a man who lifts.

594
01:03:06.625 --> 01:03:10.125
I am a man who pumps.

595
01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:12.875
You want more?

596
01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:16.958
No.

597
01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:19.416
-Just a little fix.
-No. No!

598
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.625
Mom! I just wanna feel pretty.

599
01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:25.125
I can't live with this face anymore.

600
01:04:24.416 --> 01:04:25.291
Mom?

601
01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:26.333
YEARBOOK

602
01:05:26.833 --> 01:05:30.833
BETHEL CHRISTIAN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL
SURABAYA

603
01:05:49.833 --> 01:05:54.000
When I grow up,
I'll never eat instant noodles again.

604
01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:55.500
I'm going to eat

605
01:05:56.125 --> 01:06:00.833
steak, spaghetti, and ice cream

606
01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:03.666
in fancy restaurants.

607
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:10.541
I'll wear pretty dresses,
and buy all new clothes at the mall,

608
01:06:10.625 --> 01:06:13.500
and I'll marry a rich husband.

609
01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.083
Don't worry, Grace.

610
01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:22.583
You can come
and live with me and my husband.

611
01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:27.083
That's okay. You know what I want…

612
01:06:33.333 --> 01:06:34.208
is freedom.

613
01:06:34.875 --> 01:06:35.791
Okay.

614
01:06:35.875 --> 01:06:42.083
But I'll still buy you all of the makeup
so you can be pretty.

615
01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:47.875
You can get out of here
and find a handsome husband like me.

616
01:06:50.333 --> 01:06:51.291
Erika?

617
01:06:53.291 --> 01:06:54.416
Erika?

618
01:06:57.541 --> 01:06:58.708
What's with the noise?

619
01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:02.625
Hey, no need to be a bitch about it.
I'm here for the rent.

620
01:07:02.708 --> 01:07:05.708
-Next week.
-Hey, wait… a minute.

621
01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:09.083
You know you don't have to pay

622
01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:11.583
me with money.

623
01:07:11.666 --> 01:07:13.333
-Piss off!
-Hey!

624
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.708
Oh, you look divine,

625
01:07:34.791 --> 01:07:37.458
and this dress
makes you look even thinner.

626
01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:44.166
That's why I insisted that there's
only one person who could make it.

627
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:45.291
Oni!

628
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:49.458
Even though Jonathan is always shocked
when he sees my invoice.

629
01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:51.833
But she's the one who pays me.

630
01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:56.208
Oh, I can see
how much Jonathan adores you.

631
01:07:56.291 --> 01:07:58.833
For his mother, he'd do anything.

632
01:07:58.916 --> 01:08:02.500
Well, she's the one
who raised him to be so successful.

633
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.416
Behind every great man
Is an even greater mother. Remember that.

634
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.791
Angel, honey,
you have to breathe in a little more.

635
01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:15.000
It'll fit if you just hold it in a bit.

636
01:08:15.083 --> 01:08:17.500
Oh, enough! We can do this later.

637
01:08:20.875 --> 01:08:22.333
Uh, be careful. Uh, ooh.

638
01:08:22.416 --> 01:08:24.250
Grandma, I have to go study.

639
01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:28.333
Uh, maybe it's hormones.

640
01:08:28.416 --> 01:08:29.958
It's hard being a teenager.

641
01:08:30.041 --> 01:08:35.291
Back when we were young, Milla and I
used to skip school all the time.

642
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.458
So it's true you were friends,

643
01:08:40.833 --> 01:08:41.958
you and Milla?

644
01:08:43.666 --> 01:08:46.458
That's why I was so surprised to see Irah.

645
01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:48.000
Oh.

646
01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:51.166
Why hasn't Milla mentioned you before?

647
01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:53.583
We lost contact for a long time.

648
01:08:53.666 --> 01:08:56.916
Yeah. They moved to Jakarta.

649
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.958
But it caught us all by surprise.
The move was so sudden.

650
01:09:01.041 --> 01:09:02.958
It's like they disappeared.

651
01:09:04.041 --> 01:09:05.875
I think we should use the long ones.

652
01:09:06.541 --> 01:09:07.958
They go with your dress.

653
01:09:09.708 --> 01:09:10.916
So, tell me,

654
01:09:11.666 --> 01:09:12.916
when did you meet Milla?

655
01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:16.875
It was when Jonathan
had just returned from Melbourne.

656
01:09:16.958 --> 01:09:21.000
Mm, well, the last time that I saw Milla

657
01:09:21.083 --> 01:09:24.166
must have been when we were 14,

658
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:28.625
and she was very different back then.

659
01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:30.791
Different?

660
01:09:32.958 --> 01:09:33.833
What do you mean?

661
01:09:36.166 --> 01:09:39.333
Any woman can be transformed
as long as there's money.

662
01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:41.666
That's why you should find
a proper husband.

663
01:09:42.333 --> 01:09:43.250
Yeah.

664
01:09:44.583 --> 01:09:45.916
Maybe it…

665
01:09:47.208 --> 01:09:51.375
it's because I haven't seen her
in so long.

666
01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:19.875
I was so shocked to see Milla's condition.

667
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.458
We've sent the test results to Singapore.

668
01:10:27.541 --> 01:10:30.041
No one can explain
what's happening to her.

669
01:10:31.166 --> 01:10:33.958
Every diagnosis is different. I…

670
01:10:35.208 --> 01:10:36.916
Honestly, I don't know what to do.

671
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.750
Maybe there's something deeper going on.

672
01:10:43.166 --> 01:10:44.458
I, um…

673
01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:46.000
I could help you.

674
01:10:50.583 --> 01:10:51.833
What do you think?

675
01:10:51.916 --> 01:10:56.250
I'm sure it has something to do
with a childhood trauma.

676
01:10:57.291 --> 01:10:59.791
She really suffered after the accident.

677
01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:01.541
Accident?

678
01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:03.416
You don't know, do you?

679
01:11:17.208 --> 01:11:19.500
Grace is not a hallucination.

680
01:11:21.125 --> 01:11:22.125
She's real.

681
01:11:26.291 --> 01:11:27.458
Grace Camilla.

682
01:11:28.875 --> 01:11:30.500
-This is Milla.
-Impossible!

683
01:11:31.416 --> 01:11:33.375
-But I was there.
-That's not Milla.

684
01:11:33.875 --> 01:11:36.083
-I know it's her.
-What do you know?

685
01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:37.500
Everything.

686
01:11:39.916 --> 01:11:41.875
I saw her after the accident.

687
01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:43.583
Her face

688
01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:45.916
was disfigured.

689
01:11:47.625 --> 01:11:49.916
Then she suddenly left Surabaya.

690
01:11:50.625 --> 01:11:53.916
Her mom, Novi, is hiding everything.

691
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
She's been lying to you, Jon.

692
01:11:58.458 --> 01:11:59.791
And to Milla.

693
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.875
Stop avoiding the issue.
Erika told us everything!

694
01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:39.250
She… She's a liar!

695
01:12:39.791 --> 01:12:43.166
So you and your daughter,
you're not liars?

696
01:12:44.291 --> 01:12:47.625
Listen, this is not
about Milla's accident.

697
01:12:48.458 --> 01:12:52.125
This is about you taking advantage of us

698
01:12:52.208 --> 01:12:56.250
and behaving dishonestly
to get our family to support you.

699
01:12:56.333 --> 01:12:59.541
But I just didn't think
it was something worth mentioning.

700
01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:03.041
Milla was just an unfortunate girl
who had a terrible accident.

701
01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:05.666
I am so grateful

702
01:13:06.291 --> 01:13:08.583
to you and Jonathan
for taking my daughter in.

703
01:13:08.666 --> 01:13:09.541
Enough!

704
01:13:09.625 --> 01:13:13.833
I want you out of this house
and to never come back.

705
01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:41.041
Will you hurry up?

706
01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:44.791
We're already late for the service.

707
01:13:48.916 --> 01:13:51.708
I said you don't need to look fancy.

708
01:13:52.458 --> 01:13:54.583
A headband won't make you prettier.

709
01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:04.791
-Okay, bro, lower it.
-Yep.

710
01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:07.666
-Hey, can you loosen the rope?
-Got it. And one, two, three.

711
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:09.041
Yep. Uh…

712
01:14:14.041 --> 01:14:16.458
-Miss, don't stand there!
-Watch out! Stop!

713
01:14:20.625 --> 01:14:22.500
Grace! Oh my God!

714
01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:24.000
Grace!

715
01:14:39.166 --> 01:14:42.916
Please help her! Grace!

716
01:14:46.041 --> 01:14:48.666
What is happening to Grace, ma'am?

717
01:14:49.625 --> 01:14:51.833
How could she not recognize me?

718
01:14:52.541 --> 01:14:53.541
Or you?

719
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.208
The doctor said…

720
01:15:01.083 --> 01:15:03.000
the trauma from the accident

721
01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:07.000
has made her forget everything.

722
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.875
I can't bear to see her face
damaged like that.

723
01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:16.958
Don't cry, Irah.

724
01:15:21.875 --> 01:15:24.083
This is all a test.

725
01:15:25.166 --> 01:15:28.125
It's an opportunity from God.

726
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.375
From now on,

727
01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:50.375
every door will be open for you,

728
01:15:51.666 --> 01:15:53.125
my dear girl.

729
01:16:01.125 --> 01:16:02.083
Milla.

730
01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:11.666
Mom?

731
01:16:17.875 --> 01:16:18.791
Is it true?

732
01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:48.375
Jon?

733
01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:07.708
You are sick.

734
01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:11.208
Sick, just like your mom.

735
01:17:13.708 --> 01:17:16.666
-Jon, I only just remembered--
-Do you actually love me?

736
01:17:20.416 --> 01:17:21.416
Do you?

737
01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:25.375
-Or do you just love this?
-No!

738
01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:28.750
-I care about this family.
-You expect me to believe that?

739
01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:31.250
Erika told me everything.

740
01:17:36.333 --> 01:17:37.166
Truth.

741
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:38.833
Honesty.

742
01:17:40.333 --> 01:17:41.750
That's all I ask.

743
01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:47.458
I need to fix this family.

744
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.958
-My child.
-Angel?

745
01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:50.916
No!

746
01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:52.500
No, Mil.

747
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:55.291
You are sick, Milla.

748
01:18:02.791 --> 01:18:04.541
You need time to think this through.

749
01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:09.958
Jon!

750
01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:11.375
Jon?!

751
01:18:15.708 --> 01:18:16.875
Open the door!

752
01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:22.708
Angel!

753
01:18:23.791 --> 01:18:25.750
Open this door, Jon!

754
01:18:27.166 --> 01:18:28.375
Jon!

755
01:18:30.583 --> 01:18:31.750
I'm sorry, Mother.

756
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:36.291
I failed this family.

757
01:18:37.125 --> 01:18:38.291
Never.

758
01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:39.375
Angel!

759
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:41.958
Don't blame yourself.

760
01:18:42.041 --> 01:18:43.916
It isn't because of you.

761
01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:48.833
Jon. Look at me, Jon.

762
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:51.166
Jon!

763
01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:55.166
-Open the door now!
-Remember, you're a Gunawan.

764
01:18:58.458 --> 01:18:59.791
Angel!

765
01:19:02.416 --> 01:19:05.208
-Why are you doing this to Mom?
-Angel!

766
01:19:06.291 --> 01:19:07.625
Angel!

767
01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:13.125
Angel.

768
01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:16.000
Don't worry, Angel.

769
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
This is for the good of our family.

770
01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:21.791
Your mom is sick.

771
01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:24.916
This is all sick.

772
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:32.666
Open the door!

773
01:20:31.166 --> 01:20:33.750
Hey, you! Be careful with that.

774
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.875
It's very expensive.

775
01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:49.958
-Hey, Jon.
-Hey.

776
01:20:51.333 --> 01:20:54.291
Uh, thank you
for keeping my mother company.

777
01:20:55.708 --> 01:20:57.583
I don't know what I'd do without you.

778
01:20:59.666 --> 01:21:02.291
No, it's nothing. I'm happy to do it.

779
01:21:03.666 --> 01:21:04.583
Thank you.

780
01:21:06.208 --> 01:21:07.750
All right. I'll see you.

781
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:09.083
Okay.

782
01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:20.208
Angel.

783
01:21:40.458 --> 01:21:42.416
Oh, that looks like…

784
01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.625
Remedy steamed chicken. Your favorite.

785
01:21:47.208 --> 01:21:48.125
I'll dish it out.

786
01:21:49.916 --> 01:21:51.041
Here you are.

787
01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:04.041
How are you still not married?

788
01:22:07.416 --> 01:22:10.541
I've been focused on helping my family.

789
01:22:11.458 --> 01:22:14.583
Well, at least
until my siblings finish college.

790
01:22:15.208 --> 01:22:17.875
That's why I'm taking
all the jobs I can get.

791
01:22:18.458 --> 01:22:19.875
When you do get married…

792
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.458
I hope you find someone reliable.

793
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Someone who can take care of you
and your family.

794
01:22:34.875 --> 01:22:37.208
Not everyone is as lucky as Milla.

795
01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:42.041
Uh, Irah!

796
01:22:50.458 --> 01:22:52.625
Can you bring this to Milla?

797
01:22:52.708 --> 01:22:55.541
-Yes, madam.
-May I take it instead?

798
01:23:07.666 --> 01:23:08.750
It's dark in here.

799
01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:18.083
Hm. How about a little light?

800
01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.416
What do you want?

801
01:23:30.583 --> 01:23:31.625
Here's your lunch.

802
01:23:52.916 --> 01:23:54.291
It's good for your skin.

803
01:23:57.708 --> 01:23:58.541
God, Milla!

804
01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:18.000
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

805
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:24.666
Why?

806
01:24:37.458 --> 01:24:38.583
Survival,

807
01:24:40.166 --> 01:24:41.000
Milla.

808
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:19.625
Mil!

809
01:25:21.833 --> 01:25:22.750
Undress.

810
01:25:42.708 --> 01:25:43.583
Try it.

811
01:26:03.166 --> 01:26:04.333
Stop, Mil.

812
01:26:08.458 --> 01:26:09.833
Take it easy!

813
01:26:39.833 --> 01:26:40.958
Now you're perfect.

814
01:27:18.541 --> 01:27:20.250
One, two, three.

815
01:27:22.416 --> 01:27:23.250
Erika!

816
01:27:23.833 --> 01:27:25.750
Here, get in the photo.

817
01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:29.416
They're from High Lane. Come on, quick.

818
01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:30.333
Okay.

819
01:27:30.833 --> 01:27:32.500
Ma'am, step forward, please.

820
01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:35.625
Perfect. One, two, three.

821
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:41.125
Ah, ladies, meet my makeup artist.

822
01:27:41.208 --> 01:27:42.750
Hi. I'm Erika.

823
01:27:43.375 --> 01:27:46.625
Oh, you are incredible.
Liliana looks amazing.

824
01:27:46.708 --> 01:27:49.250
-Thank you.
-I wanna book you.

825
01:27:49.333 --> 01:27:50.833
Oh yes, of course.

826
01:27:50.916 --> 01:27:52.250
Angel! Here.

827
01:27:54.583 --> 01:27:55.541
Angel!

828
01:27:56.041 --> 01:27:59.125
-You look beautiful
-And did Erika do your makeup?

829
01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:00.541
Definitely not.

830
01:28:02.125 --> 01:28:03.250
That's my mom's dress.

831
01:28:04.166 --> 01:28:05.166
Angel!

832
01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:06.125
Royhan!

833
01:28:06.833 --> 01:28:09.583
Well, we should really go say hello to…

834
01:28:12.791 --> 01:28:13.958
You made it!

835
01:28:14.041 --> 01:28:16.166
Why don't we go over here?

836
01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:18.875
This party is really, really boring.

837
01:28:19.458 --> 01:28:21.666
Yeah, yeah, I agree. If it reached Africa…

838
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:23.083
Yes, in Tunisia.

839
01:28:23.166 --> 01:28:24.500
-I've heard that there's--
-Jon.

840
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:27.208
Oh, I thought you were Milla.

841
01:28:27.708 --> 01:28:28.750
I'm Erika.

842
01:28:28.833 --> 01:28:29.916
Oh. Yes.

843
01:28:30.416 --> 01:28:31.541
You look different.

844
01:28:33.583 --> 01:28:35.625
-Psst. Grab a drink.
-Ah, of course.

845
01:28:35.708 --> 01:28:36.625
This way.

846
01:29:16.541 --> 01:29:17.375
Mom,

847
01:29:18.708 --> 01:29:19.708
because of you,

848
01:29:20.416 --> 01:29:22.333
I have the vision to reach my dreams.

849
01:29:24.250 --> 01:29:26.208
You have sacrificed so much,

850
01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.750
and you've been here with me

851
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:32.458
during the best

852
01:29:33.125 --> 01:29:34.500
and the worst of times.

853
01:29:35.583 --> 01:29:36.541
I love you, Mom.

854
01:29:38.083 --> 01:29:39.041
Happy birthday.

855
01:29:41.125 --> 01:29:47.416
Cut the cake Cut the cake right…

856
01:30:01.666 --> 01:30:05.125
Cut the cake

857
01:30:05.208 --> 01:30:09.000
Cut the cake right now

858
01:30:09.083 --> 01:30:12.833
Right now

859
01:30:12.916 --> 01:30:17.958
Right now

860
01:30:18.875 --> 01:30:20.583
Cut the cake…

861
01:30:24.541 --> 01:30:25.791
Happy birthday, Mother.

862
01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:29.625
-Milla! Go back to your room.
-Jon.

863
01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:32.000
But I just want to celebrate.

864
01:30:44.291 --> 01:30:47.333
What, Jon? Afraid they'll see
how rotten we are?

865
01:31:18.208 --> 01:31:19.833
THE MOMENT BEAUTY BECOMES THE BEAST!

866
01:31:20.416 --> 01:31:22.041
-Milla!
-Oh my God.

867
01:31:22.541 --> 01:31:25.208
Oh my God, look at this. It's crazy, man.

868
01:31:26.166 --> 01:31:27.750
That is so messed up!

869
01:31:27.833 --> 01:31:29.041
Roy.

870
01:31:30.083 --> 01:31:30.958
Roy!

871
01:31:32.333 --> 01:31:33.208
Roy!

872
01:31:34.916 --> 01:31:37.041
Royhan! Why did you post the video?

873
01:31:37.125 --> 01:31:37.958
So what?

874
01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:39.416
It's a free country.

875
01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.708
-She's my mother.
-Who cares?

876
01:31:41.791 --> 01:31:44.375
You're just overreacting. I'm out of here.

877
01:31:44.458 --> 01:31:45.500
Asshole!

878
01:31:47.166 --> 01:31:49.375
I sincerely apologize, sir.

879
01:31:49.458 --> 01:31:51.333
You know I had my doubts,

880
01:31:51.416 --> 01:31:55.333
but your mother convinced me
to put my trust in you,

881
01:31:55.416 --> 01:31:56.875
and look what's happened.

882
01:31:57.375 --> 01:31:58.541
You're tarnishing our brand.

883
01:31:59.125 --> 01:32:02.000
Sir, I am truly sorry.

884
01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.666
Handle your wife,

885
01:32:04.458 --> 01:32:06.625
and stop flaunting our products.

886
01:32:06.708 --> 01:32:10.166
Sir, please give me another chance.

887
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:12.375
I promise I can fix this.

888
01:32:20.791 --> 01:32:24.250
LILIANA GUNAWAN'S TALE OF INSPIRATION
BUILDING A DYNASTY

889
01:33:03.791 --> 01:33:05.583
It's not your fault.

890
01:33:13.166 --> 01:33:15.416
Isn't it always our fault?

891
01:33:21.166 --> 01:33:22.208
We're women.

892
01:33:26.625 --> 01:33:28.666
What else is our duty…

893
01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:34.916
if not to protect our family's reputation?

894
01:33:41.416 --> 01:33:44.750
I have to be the one to fix this.

895
01:33:57.250 --> 01:33:58.125
Do you…

896
01:34:00.166 --> 01:34:01.208
want to help me?

897
01:34:19.208 --> 01:34:21.333
My Eternity Life family…

898
01:34:24.916 --> 01:34:26.625
I'd like to apologize

899
01:34:27.375 --> 01:34:28.250
to all of you.

900
01:34:33.458 --> 01:34:34.333
I…

901
01:34:35.125 --> 01:34:38.250
have come to realize that my wife

902
01:34:38.958 --> 01:34:41.541
is suffering from a mental illness.

903
01:34:43.833 --> 01:34:44.916
And because of this…

904
01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:50.625
Eternity Life

905
01:34:52.083 --> 01:34:55.666
will develop a new range of supplements

906
01:34:56.250 --> 01:34:57.500
to help treat

907
01:34:58.750 --> 01:35:00.166
mental health issues.

908
01:35:01.625 --> 01:35:05.416
Because mental illness
is not something to fear.

909
01:35:07.458 --> 01:35:08.375
Or something

910
01:35:09.541 --> 01:35:10.750
to hide from.

911
01:35:14.583 --> 01:35:16.208
Thank you for your understanding

912
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:17.958
and your support

913
01:35:18.875 --> 01:35:20.083
for Eternity Life.

914
01:35:24.541 --> 01:35:25.666
Good night.

915
01:35:56.916 --> 01:35:58.000
It's okay.

916
01:36:47.416 --> 01:36:49.708
Sorry, Irah and Hatta,

917
01:36:50.916 --> 01:36:53.000
for the trouble I've caused.

918
01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:54.416
It's okay, ma'am.

919
01:36:55.833 --> 01:36:57.875
So, you're going back to your hometown?

920
01:36:57.958 --> 01:36:59.166
Yes, that's right.

921
01:37:00.166 --> 01:37:04.083
Back home, all the men
work in the rice fields,

922
01:37:04.166 --> 01:37:09.125
planting, nurturing,
harvesting, and ngareremokeun.

923
01:37:09.208 --> 01:37:11.833
Hatta always leads the ritual.

924
01:37:11.916 --> 01:37:13.083
Ngareremokeun?

925
01:37:13.583 --> 01:37:15.583
A ritual to honor nature.

926
01:37:20.333 --> 01:37:21.833
My father always says

927
01:37:21.916 --> 01:37:26.416
whatever our hands give,
our hands receive in return.

928
01:37:39.166 --> 01:37:40.750
Take me there, Hatta.

929
01:37:40.833 --> 01:37:41.791
But, miss…

930
01:37:42.791 --> 01:37:43.750
Irah…

931
01:37:48.958 --> 01:37:52.958
I will only rot here and waste away.

932
01:37:53.916 --> 01:37:55.041
Are you sure?

933
01:37:55.125 --> 01:37:56.500
I am, yeah.

934
01:37:58.291 --> 01:38:02.708
I can't remember
the last time I was true to myself.

935
01:38:03.708 --> 01:38:05.291
Okay.

936
01:38:05.375 --> 01:38:06.666
Okay.

937
01:38:38.291 --> 01:38:39.625
When you were little,

938
01:38:41.333 --> 01:38:43.333
as soon as you woke up,

939
01:38:43.416 --> 01:38:45.708
you'd jump into my bed for a hug.

940
01:38:48.125 --> 01:38:48.958
Yeah.

941
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:50.916
I was so silly.

942
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:51.833
No.

943
01:38:52.375 --> 01:38:53.666
You were adorable.

944
01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:00.291
Angie…

945
01:39:00.375 --> 01:39:01.208
Mm?

946
01:39:03.125 --> 01:39:06.416
-I'm sorry I haven't been more--
-It's not your fault.

947
01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:09.000
For your illness.

948
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:16.208
I feel like it's actually a blessing.

949
01:39:23.708 --> 01:39:24.833
What do you mean?

950
01:39:27.416 --> 01:39:28.291
Well,

951
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:31.000
all this time,

952
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:35.500
I've been living how others want me to.

953
01:39:39.333 --> 01:39:40.541
I can see now

954
01:39:42.291 --> 01:39:43.791
that I don't belong here.

955
01:39:48.541 --> 01:39:49.375
Angie,

956
01:39:50.166 --> 01:39:51.916
why don't you come with me?

957
01:39:54.375 --> 01:39:56.708
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

958
01:39:58.291 --> 01:39:59.458
Angie,

959
01:40:00.375 --> 01:40:03.833
there's so much more to life
than this, my love.

960
01:40:03.916 --> 01:40:06.166
But, Mom, your life is yours,

961
01:40:06.875 --> 01:40:08.291
and my life is mine.

962
01:40:08.375 --> 01:40:10.708
And I don't want your life
to end up like mine.

963
01:40:10.791 --> 01:40:12.000
It won't.

964
01:40:13.291 --> 01:40:14.208
Mom…

965
01:40:16.833 --> 01:40:20.208
this… is the life that I know.

966
01:40:21.625 --> 01:40:24.708
Sometimes it can be really painful, but

967
01:40:25.958 --> 01:40:27.500
let me deal with it.

968
01:40:30.833 --> 01:40:33.291
You always told me I'm a strong girl.

969
01:40:33.375 --> 01:40:34.666
Yeah.

970
01:40:36.916 --> 01:40:37.833
Mom,

971
01:40:39.041 --> 01:40:40.166
you trust me,

972
01:40:41.333 --> 01:40:42.208
right?

973
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:48.750
I trust you.

974
01:40:51.250 --> 01:40:52.791
Then you know I'll be all right.

975
01:40:55.791 --> 01:40:57.916
You promise me

976
01:40:58.833 --> 01:41:01.375
to stay true to yourself.

977
01:41:01.875 --> 01:41:04.250
And any time you need me--

978
01:41:04.333 --> 01:41:05.416
Don't worry.

979
01:41:08.250 --> 01:41:09.458
I'll find you.

980
01:42:18.416 --> 01:42:19.750
Where are you going?!

981
01:42:23.916 --> 01:42:25.916
Are you trying to cause trouble?

982
01:42:28.125 --> 01:42:29.708
You selfish girl!

983
01:42:30.791 --> 01:42:33.625
Do you realize how hard I had to work

984
01:42:33.708 --> 01:42:35.958
to pay for your surgery?

985
01:42:36.791 --> 01:42:38.750
Your father abandoned us.

986
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:42.583
Do you think
we could rely on your looks to save us?

987
01:42:43.833 --> 01:42:46.625
This world isn't built
for women like you and me.

988
01:42:46.708 --> 01:42:48.375
Mom, I was erased.

989
01:42:49.458 --> 01:42:52.083
I was erased by you.

990
01:42:53.833 --> 01:42:55.625
It was for your happiness.
I did it for you!

991
01:42:55.708 --> 01:42:59.291
Mom, if you care about my happiness,

992
01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:02.250
then let me go, Mom.

993
01:43:05.958 --> 01:43:08.958
Well if you don't care
about your life anymore,

994
01:43:09.041 --> 01:43:12.750
then the least that you could do
is pay back what you owe me!

995
01:43:30.541 --> 01:43:32.125
Oh, Milla!

996
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:34.583
Milla!

997
01:43:39.083 --> 01:43:40.916
Stop, please, Milla!

998
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.291
I don't owe you anything anymore.

999
01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.416
You're insane!

1000
01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.041
You're going crazy.

1001
01:43:49.125 --> 01:43:50.541
Milla!

1002
01:43:55.333 --> 01:43:56.166
Mom!

1003
