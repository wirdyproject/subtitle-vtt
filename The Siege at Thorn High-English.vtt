00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.916
Cool sketch.

2
00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:05.708
Thanks.

3
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.250
You're Silvi's brother, right?

4
00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:10.958
Yeah.

5
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.125
Can you do me a favor?

6
00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:14.208
Give this to your sister.

7
00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:17.625
What's that?

8
00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:19.375
A letter.

9
00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:20.416
A love letter?

10
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:25.500
Give it to her yourself.

11
00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:30.125
What's up?

12
00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.500
He wants to give a love letter.

13
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.333
To whom?

14
00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:37.583
You don't think it's for me, do you?

15
00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:41.291
Oh, my God, Panca!
A love letter in this day and age?

16
00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:46.208
You think this is like applying for a job?
Text me, or talk to me directly.

17
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.125
-Can I?
-Of course.

18
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:54.500
But I don't know whether
I'll accept your confession or not.

19
00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.583
Are you going to talk?

20
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:00.958
Woosh!

21
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:02.750
And the hero's dead.

22
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.958
Is recess over already?
But it's only been five minutes.

23
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:11.041
What's going on?

24
00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:31.250
Kids, classes are cancelled today.

25
00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:36.000
Go straight home, don't go anywhere else.

26
00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:36.958
What's going on, sir?

27
00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:39.500
There's a riot.

28
00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:41.666
We don't know how bad it is.

29
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.625
Come on now! It's important
that all of you go home immediately!

30
00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:50.083
Avoid the crowds on the street.

31
00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:51.500
Yes, sir.

32
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:57.500
-Be careful, you're Chinese!
-Edwin! Win! Edwin!

33
00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:00.916
Come on, walk faster.

34
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.583
-Why the rush?
-Hurry up!

35
00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:10.416
-Silvi, let me take you home!
-No need, we can go by ourselves.

36
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.333
-It's not safe! Get in the car!
-No need!

37
00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:15.125
-Go ahead without me.
-Yes, sir.

38
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:22.416
-Why are you here?
-I'm coming with you.

39
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.041
-No need.
-I'm coming!

40
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.083
This bus is not going to our street.

41
00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:38.791
It's fine, I know where to get off.

42
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.750
Have you tried calling Mom and Dad?

43
00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:51.166
The number you have reached
is not available.

44
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.666
Their phones are off.

45
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.583
I hope they're home.

46
00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:20.250
OWNED BY NATIVES

47
00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:26.833
There's a Chinese!

48
00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:29.000
Get out, you pig!

49
00:04:29.083 --> 00:04:30.500
Get down!

50
00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:33.291
Get out, you Chinese!

51
00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:41.041
Close the door! Close the windows.

52
00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:42.166
Get out!

53
00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:46.541
Go, Mr. Driver!

54
00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:51.666
Hey, fuckers! Get out of the bus!

55
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.958
Get out!

56
00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:07.791
-Sis!
-Silvi!

57
00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:09.833
Shut up!

58
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.750
Silvi!

59
00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:15.250
Silvi!

60
00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:17.666
Silvi!

61
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.291
-Shut up!
-No!

62
00:05:19.416 --> 00:05:22.166
-They are my friends!
-Shut up!

63
00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:25.375
They are my friends!

64
00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:32.208
Don't touch my brother!

65
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:33.708
No one's touching your brother!

66
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.875
-Please, sir. They're my friends!
-You fool!

67
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:37.750
You fool!

68
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:41.125
Shut up!

69
00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:42.875
No!

70
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:44.708
Silvi!

71
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:49.291
-Silvi.
-What's with you?

72
00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:50.708
What do you want?

73
00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:54.583
Are you a Chinese too?

74
00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:56.708
No, I'm not, sir.

75
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.125
Then why are you defending them?

76
00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:00.333
Panca!

77
00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:03.833
You brat!

78
00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:06.958
Now...

79
00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:13.083
Get out of here.

80
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.333
Panca.

81
00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:21.708
Scram!

82
00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:26.250
-Silvi.
-Panca...

83
00:06:26.333 --> 00:06:29.666
Get out or I will kill you!

84
00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.875
-Panca!
-Shut up!

85
00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.750
Quick, strip her! Hurry!

86
00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:41.291
-Fuck you!
-Sis!

87
00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:43.750
Sis!

88
00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:09.541
Sis...

89
00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:14.583
Sis!

90
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:40.291
Hey! Slant-eye!
Don't go there! It's dangerous!

91
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:45.666
To hell with you!

92
00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:09.250
Mom! Dad!

93
00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:14.416
Mom! Dad!

94
00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:17.125
Dad! Mom!

95
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.833
Mom!

96
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.833
Dad! Mom!

97
00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:44.041
PIGS

98
00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:45.750
PIGS

99
00:08:45.833 --> 00:08:47.583
CHINESE EVIL PIGS
STEALING OUR WEALTH

100
00:08:47.666 --> 00:08:51.291
Due to the bombing on New Year's Eve,

101
00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:53.208
several social experts

102
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:56.333
warn about the possibility
of another big riot happening

103
00:08:56.416 --> 00:09:00.250
between community groups in some
of the high-risk areas in the country.

104
00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:03.625
Social observer, Haryono Sungkono
said that the clashes

105
00:09:03.708 --> 00:09:08.208
between two social groups in the east
of the city can't be taken lightly.

106
00:09:15.083 --> 00:09:17.625
GO BACK TO CHINA, BASTARDS!

107
00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:25.791
RELIGIOUS WORSHIP DOES NOT KILL

108
00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:29.333
Equality!

109
00:09:29.416 --> 00:09:33.083
Stop racism!

110
00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:36.666
Social justice!

111
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.958
For us all!

112
00:09:40.041 --> 00:09:43.250
Anti-discrimination!

113
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.708
We're all the same!

114
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:46.791
We're all the same!

115
00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.208
-Slant-eyes!
-Fuck you!

116
00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:51.291
Police!

117
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.791
MISSING
ODY NUGROHO

118
00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:03.750
THORN HIGH JAKARTA

119
00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:11.375
Our students are not like any other.
They need strict teachers.

120
00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:16.000
I've been teaching in five high schools
for the past two years

121
00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:17.458
as a substitute teacher.

122
00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:20.916
Five schools in two years?

123
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:23.041
Why do you keep moving around so much?

124
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.666
I moved whenever the school
no longer needed a substitute teacher.

125
00:10:29.708 --> 00:10:35.708
Well, you're lucky because
we are extremely understaffed right now.

126
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:38.166
Many of our teachers resigned.

127
00:10:39.416 --> 00:10:40.750
Why is that?

128
00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:43.875
It's not the students' fault,
if that's what you're thinking.

129
00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:48.625
As adults, we have to show
that we're the ones in authority,

130
00:10:48.708 --> 00:10:50.750
and then the kids will leave us alone.

131
00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:54.750
The only thing they're afraid of right now

132
00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:58.916
is being sent here and having to face me.

133
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.333
Because they know I wield authority.

134
00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:06.208
If I get them expelled
without a letter of recommendation,

135
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.875
the other schools won't accept them.

136
00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:11.625
I will keep that in mind.

137
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.041
Your name is Edwin?

138
00:11:18.916 --> 00:11:20.791
-Just Edwin?
-Yes, sir.

139
00:11:21.708 --> 00:11:24.916
Do you have a last name?

140
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.125
Just Edwin.

141
00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:32.041
When I read your application letter,

142
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:35.416
I didn't know that you were...

143
00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:37.000
Chinese?

144
00:11:38.666 --> 00:11:39.916
Chinese Indonesian.

145
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.125
I hope that won't be a problem for you.

146
00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:49.875
I may be the only person here

147
00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.625
who doesn't care about racial differences.

148
00:11:55.083 --> 00:11:56.875
My father is from the east,

149
00:11:57.458 --> 00:11:59.208
and my mother is from the western region.

150
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.541
My children-in-law are from here,
from the north, the south...

151
00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:05.083
But none of them are Chinese.

152
00:12:10.416 --> 00:12:13.291
Edwin, I'm on your side.

153
00:12:14.416 --> 00:12:17.375
I'm just worried that
you could get into trouble here.

154
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.416
This is Class 3F, right?

155
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:52.208
Can't you read?

156
00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:55.541
-You're from Class 3F?
-Yes.

157
00:12:56.666 --> 00:12:57.791
Why are you outside?

158
00:13:00.416 --> 00:13:01.416
Who are you?

159
00:13:02.416 --> 00:13:04.083
I'm your new homeroom teacher.

160
00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:06.666
What happened to Mr. Yakub?

161
00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:08.875
No idea. You should know.

162
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.000
No, why should I?

163
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.833
Am I his family?

164
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.041
Weirdo.

165
00:13:20.541 --> 00:13:21.708
Good morning.

166
00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:29.291
Good morning.

167
00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:41.541
Good morning.

168
00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:46.791
I'm your new homeroom teacher.
Please take your seats.

169
00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:55.958
Dropping stuff like shit.

170
00:13:57.083 --> 00:13:58.166
What did you say?

171
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.333
My name is Edwin.

172
00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:10.833
You don't have to call me "sir"
if you don't want to.

173
00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:14.708
Why don't you use your real name?
Like Tan Jung Ho or whatever.

174
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.500
Edwin is my real name. What's yours?

175
00:14:17.583 --> 00:14:18.750
Tan Jung Ho.

176
00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:23.250
You're Toni?

177
00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:25.500
I'm Toni.

178
00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:28.750
If you're in Toni's seat,
then you're Reihan?

179
00:14:29.583 --> 00:14:30.583
That'll be me.

180
00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:34.416
That means none of you
are sitting in your assigned seats.

181
00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.291
Are you here to teach or joke around?

182
00:14:46.416 --> 00:14:48.750
Do you talk to your parents like that too?

183
00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:52.500
And you're wondering why they hate you?

184
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.625
I know kids like you.

185
00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.125
Always angry, and you don't even know why.

186
00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:04.625
Maybe it's because your father beats you.

187
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.125
Because he thinks you're a hopeless case.

188
00:15:09.166 --> 00:15:12.250
Bad grades, slow learner,

189
00:15:12.708 --> 00:15:14.791
a complete troublemaker, right?

190
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.958
-How did he know?
-Shut up!

191
00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.583
Okay, settle down. Let's continue.

192
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.333
I will also be teaching arts.

193
00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:36.166
I know many of you don't appreciate art,
but what I want to teach is...

194
00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.541
I could find out who threw this
if I wanted to.

195
00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:06.666
But never mind, I already know who did.

196
00:16:09.416 --> 00:16:10.708
Must be a wimp.

197
00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:13.041
Such a lame-ass throw.

198
00:16:17.708 --> 00:16:19.583
Come to me when you need help, okay?

199
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.416
There's no reception here.

200
00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:27.875
The signal is scrambled
so the kids can't use their phones.

201
00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.083
It's hard to control them.
They always use it to cheat.

202
00:16:32.166 --> 00:16:35.500
Actually, I wanted to check the time.
I don't have my watch on me.

203
00:16:37.916 --> 00:16:40.250
I'm Diana, I work here too.

204
00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.791
-Edwin.
-The principal told me about you.

205
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.958
How was your first day?

206
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.375
Not so bad, no one died.

207
00:16:49.916 --> 00:16:51.250
No one died.

208
00:16:51.333 --> 00:16:53.083
How bad was your first day?

209
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.916
Well, no one died either.

210
00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:57.041
But they did make me cry.

211
00:16:57.666 --> 00:17:00.708
-What did you do before?
-I'm in a rush. Let's talk tomorrow.

212
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.041
Okay, tomorrow then.

213
00:17:04.583 --> 00:17:06.541
Buy me something.

214
00:17:15.916 --> 00:17:17.291
How do you know?

215
00:17:17.375 --> 00:17:20.500
-Hey! Put your foot down! It's dirty!
-Watch your feet!

216
00:17:20.583 --> 00:17:22.375
-Relax!
-I'll wipe it with your mustache!

217
00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:26.166
Look. It's the pig. What does he want?

218
00:17:27.291 --> 00:17:29.583
He's been standing there for 15 minutes.

219
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.958
How disgusting! What a pervert!

220
00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:35.541
I bet he's looking for students
to fuck with.

221
00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:38.375
Let's just go. Let's hunt some pigs.

222
00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:40.125
Jef, want to hunt some pigs?

223
00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:41.791
Yes.

224
00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:45.625
I'm not afraid.

225
00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:53.458
-Are you sure he's Chinese?
-I swear. I saw him clearly.

226
00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:03.083
See?

227
00:18:16.125 --> 00:18:17.875
Where do you think you're going?

228
00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.875
Where are you going? Don't run, bastard!

229
00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:26.041
Get him out.

230
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:29.916
Fucker.

231
00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:45.666
Pig!

232
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.291
Have you ever been hit by a car?

233
00:18:55.583 --> 00:18:57.041
What do you want with me?

234
00:19:01.041 --> 00:19:01.958
Stay still.

235
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.291
Pig's blood.

236
00:19:12.375 --> 00:19:13.250
Evening, sir.

237
00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:06.250
What's your name?

238
00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:10.250
Name?

239
00:20:15.291 --> 00:20:16.125
Edwin.

240
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:19.416
Edwin.

241
00:20:25.666 --> 00:20:28.333
Someone here needs to cheer up.
It's Edwin!

242
00:20:28.416 --> 00:20:31.916
Edwin!

243
00:20:32.416 --> 00:20:36.750
Cheer up!

244
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.916
Come on, Edwin!

245
00:20:40.625 --> 00:20:41.666
Did that startle you?

246
00:20:43.708 --> 00:20:48.416
No one is allowed to be sad in this place.
Look around! No one is sad, right?

247
00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:51.791
Are you an artist?

248
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:53.583
I'm a teacher.

249
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.333
High school teacher?

250
00:20:58.041 --> 00:20:58.875
Thorn High.

251
00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:02.250
Thorn High...
The school for all the delinquents?

252
00:21:04.166 --> 00:21:07.625
But you're Chinese.
Isn't it dangerous to teach there?

253
00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:13.666
Beer only won't do.

254
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.333
Bottoms up.

255
00:21:41.625 --> 00:21:44.083
Did you pay for his drink?

256
00:21:44.166 --> 00:21:45.333
Hey!

257
00:21:45.416 --> 00:21:46.750
Wash your hands.

258
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:49.000
Whatever!

259
00:22:01.708 --> 00:22:02.583
Hey!

260
00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:04.750
Who are you?

261
00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:17.250
You want to stab me?

262
00:22:18.708 --> 00:22:19.875
Go ahead.

263
00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:25.833
Let's just go.

264
00:22:29.083 --> 00:22:30.125
Fucker.

265
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.041
You'll die.

266
00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:34.375
Fucking dog.

267
00:22:36.333 --> 00:22:37.541
Can you stand up?

268
00:22:40.791 --> 00:22:42.041
You're in my class, right?

269
00:22:42.666 --> 00:22:43.916
What's your name?

270
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.458
Khristo.

271
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.666
Where do you live? Let me take you.

272
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.291
No, thanks.

273
00:23:08.958 --> 00:23:09.916
Edwin.

274
00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:13.125
How are you today, sis?

275
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:16.166
Have I ever not been great?

276
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:21.458
I've been a good sister to you, haven't I?

277
00:23:21.541 --> 00:23:25.750
I've raised us, even without our parents.

278
00:23:28.708 --> 00:23:30.166
You're more than good, sis.

279
00:23:32.458 --> 00:23:34.291
You're the best sister in the world.

280
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.125
You have to find him.

281
00:23:47.875 --> 00:23:48.708
Who?

282
00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:51.041
My son.

283
00:23:56.083 --> 00:23:58.750
I've tried, but I couldn't find him.

284
00:24:00.208 --> 00:24:04.875
I only know he's a high school student
in East Jakarta.

285
00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:08.333
You have to find him, Edwin.

286
00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:10.291
Tell him...

287
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:14.250
I'm sorry.

288
00:24:17.375 --> 00:24:18.541
Tell him...

289
00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:22.416
that I love him.

290
00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:29.375
I want to rest.

291
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.791
Don't cry.

292
00:24:37.541 --> 00:24:39.208
I'm not crying.

293
00:24:41.791 --> 00:24:43.041
Get some rest.

294
00:24:45.541 --> 00:24:47.083
We'll look for him together.

295
00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:48.666
I promise.

296
00:25:37.916 --> 00:25:42.541
We're arriving at the station...

297
00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:48.083
For those who... Please be prepared.

298
00:25:48.208 --> 00:25:51.333
Don't forget to check
your belongings again.

299
00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:52.833
Thank God Mr. Edwin was there.

300
00:25:53.583 --> 00:25:55.458
I told you to stay at my place.

301
00:25:57.041 --> 00:25:58.750
What if this happens to you again?

302
00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:02.500
Did the pigs beat you up last night?

303
00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:04.833
-Yes.
-Fuck!

304
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.333
How did it happen?

305
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:12.375
I was on my way home from Rangga's place.

306
00:26:13.125 --> 00:26:15.500
Suddenly, they grabbed me
and threw me into their car.

307
00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:18.041
They took me to Chinatown.

308
00:26:18.125 --> 00:26:19.916
Fucking shit!

309
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.958
-Let's finish them off, Jef.
-We have to avenge him.

310
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.500
Good morning!

311
00:26:27.166 --> 00:26:29.541
Meet me after school. Don't go anywhere.

312
00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:31.083
The fucker's here.

313
00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:35.333
Please take out your drawing paper.

314
00:26:35.416 --> 00:26:37.750
I want you to remember
the most interesting thing

315
00:26:37.833 --> 00:26:39.500
that happened to you this morning,

316
00:26:40.541 --> 00:26:41.791
and draw it.

317
00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:53.958
Why aren't you drawing?

318
00:26:56.958 --> 00:26:58.583
You don't have drawing paper?

319
00:27:00.375 --> 00:27:04.166
Or is there any physical condition
that prevents you from drawing, Jefri?

320
00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:08.833
Nothing drew my attention this morning.

321
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:11.625
Nothing at all?

322
00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:16.000
What about yesterday?

323
00:27:17.625 --> 00:27:18.875
Two days ago?

324
00:27:25.833 --> 00:27:27.333
I'll cut you some slack.

325
00:27:27.416 --> 00:27:28.916
Draw whatever you want.

326
00:27:30.041 --> 00:27:32.416
How does that sound? You got some slack.

327
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.916
Because everyone
has to understand you, right?

328
00:27:37.125 --> 00:27:38.041
Come on.

329
00:27:38.458 --> 00:27:39.625
What are you waiting for?

330
00:27:40.791 --> 00:27:41.708
What a champ you are.

331
00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:43.958
To have a reputation
for beating up a teacher at school.

332
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.041
You will get expelled.

333
00:27:47.708 --> 00:27:48.708
As a school dropout,

334
00:27:48.791 --> 00:27:51.291
the best you can hope for
is to become a parking guy.

335
00:27:52.125 --> 00:27:53.375
An illegal parking guy.

336
00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:58.083
But at least you get to prove
that your father's right about you.

337
00:27:58.833 --> 00:28:00.875
Come on, then. Hit me.

338
00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:27.958
What will you draw?

339
00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:33.083
I don't know, I'm still thinking.

340
00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:42.750
Did you draw this?

341
00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:46.041
Yes.

342
00:28:47.708 --> 00:28:48.625
It's good.

343
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.416
"It's good."

344
00:29:05.833 --> 00:29:06.875
Time to go home.

345
00:29:08.541 --> 00:29:09.500
Hey!

346
00:29:12.666 --> 00:29:14.166
Slow down, okay? Sorry.

347
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.333
Thank you, sir.

348
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.666
-Can you please...
-Move!

349
00:29:25.458 --> 00:29:26.583
You're dead.

350
00:29:31.541 --> 00:29:32.916
-Sir.
-Yes.

351
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.208
-Hurry up, Khristo.
-Okay.

352
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:38.333
Khristo.

353
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.250
-Can you meet me after school?
-What for?

354
00:29:42.333 --> 00:29:44.125
There's something we need to discuss.

355
00:29:44.791 --> 00:29:46.166
I can't. I'm in a hurry.

356
00:30:12.125 --> 00:30:14.500
I think you're not cut out for our gang.

357
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.750
-Why is that?
-What do you mean?

358
00:30:16.833 --> 00:30:19.958
-You pray diligently and...
-This shithead.

359
00:30:20.041 --> 00:30:22.125
-Wait, Anto.
-When did you see me do that?

360
00:30:22.208 --> 00:30:24.333
He prays after fucking someone's daughter.

361
00:30:24.416 --> 00:30:26.125
You mean his own cousin?

362
00:30:26.208 --> 00:30:28.625
-Watch your mouth, man.
-Calm down, bro.

363
00:30:28.708 --> 00:30:31.500
-Don't be like that.
-Calm down. Forget about it.

364
00:30:31.583 --> 00:30:34.666
-It wasn't funny!
-Don't be so serious!

365
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:35.958
-Shithead.
-Forget it, man.

366
00:30:36.583 --> 00:30:38.708
Fine, then. What did you do anyway?

367
00:30:38.791 --> 00:30:43.208
Lots of things. I stole from stores.
I took their money and gold.

368
00:30:43.291 --> 00:30:46.375
-His family's fucked up, man.
-What did they do?

369
00:30:46.458 --> 00:30:49.250
You broke into some stores
and your father is corrupt?

370
00:30:49.333 --> 00:30:51.708
As long as I don't knock up
someone's daughter.

371
00:30:52.625 --> 00:30:54.333
-Fuck.
-And then pray and repent to God.

372
00:31:00.083 --> 00:31:00.916
What's going on?

373
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.291
Just the usual stuff. What's up?

374
00:31:03.375 --> 00:31:04.875
-Nothing new.
-Really?

375
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.500
He's in the trunk, Jef.

376
00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:09.333
Open it. Are you guys ready?

377
00:31:09.416 --> 00:31:10.541
-More than ready.
-Here we go.

378
00:31:12.916 --> 00:31:14.125
Poor baby.

379
00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:17.416
Open your eyes.

380
00:31:18.208 --> 00:31:20.708
What a prick. Hey, open your eyes.

381
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.083
He's so rude.
He looked at us with only one eye.

382
00:31:32.708 --> 00:31:35.166
-Open your eyes, sweetheart.
-Are you crying?

383
00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:39.875
-Let's go!
-Hey, walk properly.

384
00:31:39.958 --> 00:31:41.416
Walk properly, shithead!

385
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.625
-Sucker! I'll throw you off!
-What did I do?

386
00:31:44.166 --> 00:31:45.750
Talk clearly!

387
00:31:49.583 --> 00:31:50.833
Walk properly!

388
00:31:51.875 --> 00:31:54.250
You're too slow. Move, shithead.

389
00:31:55.041 --> 00:31:56.541
Fuck, he smells like a pig.

390
00:31:56.625 --> 00:31:59.208
What did I do to you?

391
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:02.333
One of you pigs beat up my friend.

392
00:32:03.375 --> 00:32:04.583
Come here!

393
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.875
-Walk, you pig!
-Stop talking!

394
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.708
More.

395
00:32:18.416 --> 00:32:20.500
Come on, get up.

396
00:32:20.583 --> 00:32:22.208
-Get up!
-You can do it.

397
00:32:22.708 --> 00:32:25.000
-Punch him, To!
-Fucker!

398
00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:29.916
He can take more!

399
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.375
Let's beat him some more!

400
00:32:34.458 --> 00:32:39.041
-He's strong!
-Look at her!

401
00:32:45.083 --> 00:32:46.791
Hey! Get him here.

402
00:32:47.375 --> 00:32:48.375
Come on. Let's go!

403
00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:51.458
I didn't do anything!

404
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.541
What did I do?

405
00:33:04.875 --> 00:33:07.583
Just stay here and stop talking, okay?

406
00:33:07.666 --> 00:33:11.375
So whenever my friends and I
are getting bored,

407
00:33:11.458 --> 00:33:12.750
we have a pig to play with.

408
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.666
That's a great idea.

409
00:33:15.416 --> 00:33:18.875
Just pray that we come back
to play with you soon.

410
00:33:18.958 --> 00:33:21.125
-How will he?
-Or else you'll starve to death.

411
00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:23.750
I wonder what that feels like.

412
00:33:23.833 --> 00:33:26.125
So we're bringing him food now?

413
00:33:26.208 --> 00:33:28.875
-We have to keep our pig farm, right?
-Fucker!

414
00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:32.041
What did I do wrong, you bastards?

415
00:33:32.125 --> 00:33:33.208
What do pigs eat?

416
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:34.291
-Bye!
-See you!

417
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.125
Help!

418
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:37.916
Help!

419
00:33:41.916 --> 00:33:44.166
-Can I sit here?
-Sure.

420
00:33:49.458 --> 00:33:50.416
What's wrong?

421
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.916
I was just wondering.

422
00:33:54.625 --> 00:33:55.750
About what?

423
00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:58.583
-Why do you want to teach here?
-Do you ask because I'm a woman?

424
00:33:59.208 --> 00:34:01.291
You're not one of those men

425
00:34:01.375 --> 00:34:04.291
who still thinks women can't handle
things the way men can, are you?

426
00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:07.083
Not at all. It's just that you look sane.

427
00:34:07.166 --> 00:34:09.166
It seems only insane people
are fit for this job.

428
00:34:09.791 --> 00:34:11.541
You haven't seen how crazy I can get.

429
00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:16.833
It's easier to be a female teacher here.

430
00:34:17.416 --> 00:34:19.083
The boys don't hate me.

431
00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.125
Really? Why is that?

432
00:34:21.666 --> 00:34:24.000
They don't have to prove
whose balls are bigger.

433
00:34:24.083 --> 00:34:26.041
They don't feel intimidated.

434
00:34:27.541 --> 00:34:29.875
What about the delinquent female students?

435
00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:32.333
The girls usually
just play along with the boys.

436
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:36.666
In other words, you don't acknowledge
women's emancipation.

437
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.791
Women can think for themselves.
They don't have to rely on men.

438
00:34:40.875 --> 00:34:42.583
Yeah. Only for the good things.

439
00:34:42.666 --> 00:34:45.166
When it comes to bad things,
that's all men's influence.

440
00:34:55.125 --> 00:34:57.666
I also wonder why you teach here.

441
00:34:59.791 --> 00:35:01.208
Do you ask because I'm Chinese?

442
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.083
Are you trying to hide something?

443
00:35:05.958 --> 00:35:09.833
It's crazy how things are worse now
than when I was a kid.

444
00:35:10.958 --> 00:35:12.041
What do you teach?

445
00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:18.291
After I got my degree in Psychology,
I felt I needed a challenge.

446
00:35:18.666 --> 00:35:21.333
And teaching here
has been my biggest challenge.

447
00:35:22.625 --> 00:35:23.791
How has it been so far?

448
00:35:24.666 --> 00:35:25.875
No one has died yet.

449
00:35:29.291 --> 00:35:31.250
I heard there's a new bar in Chinatown.

450
00:35:31.875 --> 00:35:34.750
And it's always full.
All the Chinese go there every night.

451
00:35:35.541 --> 00:35:36.375
The Wijaya Bar.

452
00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:38.416
Have you been there?

453
00:35:39.125 --> 00:35:39.958
Yes.

454
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.416
I want to go.

455
00:35:45.208 --> 00:35:46.041
Let's go.

456
00:35:47.875 --> 00:35:49.041
Will you take me there?

457
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.083
Wijaya Bar!

458
00:36:29.791 --> 00:36:31.000
What do you want to drink?

459
00:36:32.708 --> 00:36:33.791
What do you want?

460
00:36:34.958 --> 00:36:35.791
A negroni.

461
00:36:36.458 --> 00:36:38.333
-One negroni, please.
-Beer.

462
00:36:42.958 --> 00:36:43.833
Is it hard to make?

463
00:36:46.041 --> 00:36:47.083
You won't be able to.

464
00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:49.375
It certainly looks hard.

465
00:36:51.875 --> 00:36:53.375
Is it getting too late for you?

466
00:36:54.708 --> 00:36:56.833
I'm not married,
if that's where you're going.

467
00:36:57.708 --> 00:37:00.041
No, I mean,
it really isn't too late for you, is it?

468
00:37:01.041 --> 00:37:02.541
How long are you planning to stay?

469
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:13.916
Negroni, beer.

470
00:37:14.708 --> 00:37:15.541
Thank you.

471
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.333
Not on me.

472
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.500
Why did you change schools?

473
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.333
Why?

474
00:37:36.875 --> 00:37:38.250
Have you been snooping around?

475
00:37:40.083 --> 00:37:42.958
Do you realize that people will tell you
anything without you asking?

476
00:37:49.041 --> 00:37:50.458
I'm looking for someone.

477
00:37:51.375 --> 00:37:52.375
What do you mean?

478
00:37:55.333 --> 00:37:57.083
That's all I can tell you right now.

479
00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:00.916
Are you an undercover cop?

480
00:38:05.958 --> 00:38:06.791
No, I'm not.

481
00:38:07.916 --> 00:38:09.750
But it could be a great job for a Chinese.

482
00:38:11.125 --> 00:38:12.375
No one would suspect us.

483
00:38:20.833 --> 00:38:22.458
-Let's dance.
-I can't.

484
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.333
-Let's dance.
-I can't.

485
00:38:27.875 --> 00:38:28.708
I can't dance.

486
00:38:29.166 --> 00:38:30.250
Quiet!

487
00:38:34.166 --> 00:38:35.458
Turn up the volume!

488
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.250
Reportedly,

489
00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:42.708
the inter-religion clash was sparked
after a small disagreement

490
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:44.291
between vendors in a market,

491
00:38:44.375 --> 00:38:47.083
which spread into
a bigger issue in the city.

492
00:38:47.166 --> 00:38:52.000
People fear another riot,
like the one that happened 17 years ago.

493
00:38:53.166 --> 00:38:55.833
-Relax, it's still far away!
-Put the music back on!

494
00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:03.833
Keep the music going!

495
00:39:11.916 --> 00:39:13.000
Vera.

496
00:39:13.083 --> 00:39:15.083
Vera! She needs to cheer up!

497
00:39:20.666 --> 00:39:21.708
What was that?

498
00:39:28.583 --> 00:39:30.958
I hope the riot won't spread
to other places.

499
00:39:31.958 --> 00:39:33.083
We can't guarantee that.

500
00:39:34.291 --> 00:39:36.750
Can't you say something
that'll reassure me a little?

501
00:39:38.833 --> 00:39:41.375
Can't a psychologist reassure herself?

502
00:39:42.541 --> 00:39:44.958
No, where did you hear that?

503
00:39:49.291 --> 00:39:52.000
Well, our country is like…

504
00:39:53.208 --> 00:39:54.625
the thinnest glass.

505
00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:57.250
One tap and it breaks.

506
00:39:58.708 --> 00:40:01.291
Or like gasoline. Flammable.

507
00:40:07.125 --> 00:40:08.875
-You're taking the train home, right?
-Yes.

508
00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:10.708
Isn't the station that way?

509
00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:12.458
I'm walking you home first.

510
00:40:13.208 --> 00:40:15.125
Is it because I'm a woman?

511
00:40:15.875 --> 00:40:17.541
You're Chinese, you're at greater risk.

512
00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:19.416
Let me walk you home instead.

513
00:40:20.125 --> 00:40:21.708
And after that, you'll walk me home?

514
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:23.500
It'll be pointless.

515
00:40:24.208 --> 00:40:27.666
So, we can go our separate ways,
hone our survival skills,

516
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.500
and if we survive tonight,
we'll meet at the school?

517
00:40:30.583 --> 00:40:31.708
How does that sound?

518
00:41:15.416 --> 00:41:18.250
Where are you going? He will be mad!

519
00:41:18.333 --> 00:41:21.000
-We'll get ourselves in trouble, idiot!
-Shut up and sit still!

520
00:41:21.458 --> 00:41:22.833
Don't you believe in Jefri?

521
00:41:22.916 --> 00:41:23.875
Idiot!

522
00:41:24.583 --> 00:41:25.458
Idiot!

523
00:42:00.791 --> 00:42:02.000
Help him, Gerry!

524
00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:02.916
Quick!

525
00:42:04.958 --> 00:42:06.916
Stop here!

526
00:42:16.958 --> 00:42:18.333
Are you gonna be okay?

527
00:42:21.041 --> 00:42:22.583
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

528
00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:25.041
Jefri's in the principal's office.

529
00:42:25.125 --> 00:42:27.666
I'm heading there.
The principal wanted to see me.

530
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.000
What are you gonna tell him?

531
00:42:29.583 --> 00:42:30.916
I'll tell him what I know.

532
00:42:32.083 --> 00:42:35.500
Even if he gets expelled,
it won't solve the problem.

533
00:42:35.583 --> 00:42:36.958
He'll still come after you.

534
00:42:37.916 --> 00:42:40.625
Do you want me to lie
and defend Jefri, then?

535
00:42:42.333 --> 00:42:44.958
I'm just saying
you should've avoided him from the start.

536
00:42:48.041 --> 00:42:50.916
You're like the other teachers,
afraid of their own students.

537
00:42:52.708 --> 00:42:55.541
Even if he comes after me,
at least it'll be my problem.

538
00:42:55.625 --> 00:42:57.333
Not the school's problem anymore.

539
00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:10.333
Tell me what happened last night.

540
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
After Miss Diana and I
went our separate ways,

541
00:43:18.208 --> 00:43:19.541
I was attacked by someone.

542
00:43:20.125 --> 00:43:21.833
Around 11:00 p.m.

543
00:43:23.083 --> 00:43:25.666
Hey, where were you at that time?

544
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.833
At home, sir.

545
00:43:28.833 --> 00:43:31.250
The man who attacked me took out a knife.

546
00:43:31.833 --> 00:43:34.333
But I managed to stab him in the thigh
with his own knife.

547
00:43:34.916 --> 00:43:36.083
It was self-defense.

548
00:43:37.958 --> 00:43:38.791
Stand up.

549
00:43:40.625 --> 00:43:41.458
Stand up!

550
00:43:43.583 --> 00:43:44.875
Lower your pants.

551
00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:48.458
Lower your pants!

552
00:44:14.458 --> 00:44:15.291
All right.

553
00:44:16.625 --> 00:44:19.208
Pack up your things.

554
00:44:19.291 --> 00:44:22.500
Starting tomorrow, you don't have to come
to this school again!

555
00:44:22.583 --> 00:44:24.166
-But, sir--
-Quiet!

556
00:44:28.458 --> 00:44:31.583
Your parents should
never have given birth to you!

557
00:44:33.125 --> 00:44:36.666
If you were my child,
I would've thrown you out a long time ago!

558
00:44:49.583 --> 00:44:52.000
I've been the principal at this school
for ten years.

559
00:44:53.541 --> 00:44:56.583
I have never expelled a student.

560
00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.625
Expelling them means
you're giving up on them.

561
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:08.041
You've only been here for a few days,

562
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:12.833
and you've made me do
the thing I hate the most.

563
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:18.333
You're twice the age of these kids.

564
00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:23.458
You should've been able to prevent
the situation from getting worse!

565
00:45:28.541 --> 00:45:30.458
Allow me to return to class, sir.

566
00:45:38.625 --> 00:45:39.916
What do we do now?

567
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.083
-I don't know, man.
-Good morning.

568
00:45:42.166 --> 00:45:43.291
What, you fucker?

569
00:45:43.791 --> 00:45:44.750
Morning.

570
00:45:49.958 --> 00:45:53.375
Prepare your drawing tools
and please share this.

571
00:46:08.125 --> 00:46:10.291
Okay. Does anyone else want to walk out?

572
00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:15.708
All right then. Today we'll learn
about perspective in drawing.

573
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.458
-Are you sure?
-We use milk.

574
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.666
-Mother's milk?
-Only if it's fat-free.

575
00:46:27.083 --> 00:46:28.208
Khristo.

576
00:46:28.875 --> 00:46:31.875
I'm going to decorate
the classroom tomorrow.

577
00:46:32.875 --> 00:46:34.208
For Independence Day.

578
00:46:35.541 --> 00:46:37.791
-Can you help me?
-There's no school tomorrow.

579
00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:39.625
I know, that's why I'm doing it tomorrow.

580
00:46:40.208 --> 00:46:43.166
I want to put up your drawings.
Can you help me?

581
00:46:44.333 --> 00:46:45.500
Can Rangga come with me?

582
00:46:46.541 --> 00:46:48.791
Sure. Be here at 10:00 a.m.

583
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:55.375
What the hell?
I already have plans tomorrow.

584
00:46:56.666 --> 00:46:58.916
Are you allowed to hold a service at home?

585
00:46:59.041 --> 00:47:03.958
The churches are all closed!
Where else am I supposed to hold it?

586
00:47:04.041 --> 00:47:07.500
But do you have permission
to hold it at home?

587
00:47:07.583 --> 00:47:09.708
Do I have to ask for permission to pray?

588
00:47:22.375 --> 00:47:24.000
It's me, Diana.

589
00:47:24.916 --> 00:47:25.750
Yeah?

590
00:47:27.583 --> 00:47:28.750
I want to apologize.

591
00:47:29.791 --> 00:47:31.916
I think you did the right thing.

592
00:47:33.666 --> 00:47:35.041
Can I see you?

593
00:47:36.166 --> 00:47:37.250
Not now.

594
00:47:43.125 --> 00:47:45.125
I'll be at school at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow,

595
00:47:45.666 --> 00:47:47.625
putting up the kids' drawings
in the classroom.

596
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.833
We can meet there if you want.

597
00:47:56.333 --> 00:47:57.708
Good night.

598
00:48:02.041 --> 00:48:03.083
Sure.

599
00:49:08.291 --> 00:49:10.333
-What are you so scared of?
-What?

600
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.750
-Scared of getting bum-fucked?
-Fuck you!

601
00:49:13.458 --> 00:49:15.750
-You're crazy!
-It's fine. I'll protect you.

602
00:49:15.833 --> 00:49:17.708
-Really?
-Yes, I'll watch you getting fucked.

603
00:49:17.791 --> 00:49:18.666
Fuck you, man!

604
00:49:23.833 --> 00:49:26.083
-Thank you for coming.
-Yes, sir.

605
00:49:26.916 --> 00:49:27.750
Let's go.

606
00:49:32.583 --> 00:49:33.958
His gaze is deep.

607
00:49:35.375 --> 00:49:37.125
He wants you to hold his hand.

608
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.875
Shit. You're crazy!

609
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:43.291
I'll leave so you can have some privacy.

610
00:49:44.916 --> 00:49:47.791
Edwin, Khristo, Rangga.

611
00:49:56.208 --> 00:49:57.916
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

612
00:49:58.958 --> 00:50:01.791
I thought you were gay.
That's why I brought Rangga with me.

613
00:50:03.875 --> 00:50:06.291
Just because you brought Rangga,
and I brought Miss Diana,

614
00:50:06.375 --> 00:50:07.750
it doesn't mean I'm not gay.

615
00:50:16.833 --> 00:50:18.083
What are we waiting for?

616
00:50:18.625 --> 00:50:19.666
Weapons.

617
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:23.000
Damn! I can't wait!

618
00:50:23.333 --> 00:50:24.250
Can't wait!

619
00:50:26.083 --> 00:50:27.166
Hamdi.

620
00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:28.541
This drawing is so bad.

621
00:50:30.583 --> 00:50:33.541
It's not bad, he just didn't put
enough effort into it.

622
00:50:33.625 --> 00:50:36.458
Put it up so he'll realize how bad it is.

623
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.333
I don't think he'll care, sir.

624
00:50:39.416 --> 00:50:42.458
We're not kids anymore.
No one cares about art.

625
00:50:47.416 --> 00:50:48.416
None taken.

626
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.583
What's your plan after this?

627
00:50:50.666 --> 00:50:53.625
No idea, maybe a fitness coach?

628
00:50:54.416 --> 00:50:56.708
We're interrupting the current program

629
00:50:56.791 --> 00:50:59.791
to bring you breaking news on the riot
that occurred in--

630
00:50:59.875 --> 00:51:02.458
-I have to go. My family's at home.
-Me too.

631
00:51:02.833 --> 00:51:04.166
Who'll keep watch here?

632
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:07.041
Who cares? We don't get paid enough
to risk our lives.

633
00:51:07.125 --> 00:51:08.625
The people upstairs? Do we tell them?

634
00:51:08.708 --> 00:51:10.333
Just leave the gate open.

635
00:51:11.708 --> 00:51:14.625
This is worse than the riot 17 years ago.

636
00:51:21.166 --> 00:51:22.000
Leave it open.

637
00:51:22.083 --> 00:51:23.708
-What if someone breaks in?
-It's okay.

638
00:51:23.791 --> 00:51:24.833
-Okay.
-Let's go!

639
00:51:25.083 --> 00:51:26.916
Those fuckers.

640
00:51:29.041 --> 00:51:29.875
What?

641
00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:32.166
-Shit!
-What's up?

642
00:51:32.708 --> 00:51:34.375
-There's a riot!
-Where?

643
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.291
-Where?
-Look.

644
00:51:36.375 --> 00:51:37.875
All the pigs are being attacked.

645
00:51:37.958 --> 00:51:39.750
-For real?
-For real!

646
00:51:39.833 --> 00:51:40.791
Just look.

647
00:51:41.833 --> 00:51:42.958
Put on the radio.

648
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:48.250
The riot is escalating rapidly.

649
00:51:48.333 --> 00:51:52.583
There are only
a few police officers in the area.

650
00:51:52.666 --> 00:51:55.166
We strongly recommend our audience
to stay at home

651
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:58.958
and communicate with your neighbors
to anticipate further developments.

652
00:51:59.833 --> 00:52:00.666
Take that!

653
00:52:01.833 --> 00:52:04.000
-Die, you pigs!
-Fuckers!

654
00:52:06.666 --> 00:52:08.208
Do we have any thumbtacks left?

655
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:10.791
-Shoot.
-We ran out?

656
00:52:10.875 --> 00:52:12.208
-There's none left.
-Yeah.

657
00:52:12.291 --> 00:52:13.416
This one's lopsided.

658
00:52:13.958 --> 00:52:16.375
I have this, but I don't have scissors.

659
00:52:17.791 --> 00:52:18.916
Here, let me.

660
00:52:21.916 --> 00:52:24.500
You can easily tear this, sir.

661
00:52:28.458 --> 00:52:30.833
I don't think
we should be touching your saliva.

662
00:52:31.875 --> 00:52:33.416
Better than using my ass.

663
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:37.125
Well, you can do that,
as long as it's wet.

664
00:52:42.416 --> 00:52:47.208
Let me go check in the security room.
Hopefully there's a pair there.

665
00:52:48.541 --> 00:52:51.916
I'll give you a million bucks
for every piece of duct tape you rip.

666
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:59.666
-I'll be back.
-Yeah.

667
00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:06.750
Finally!

668
00:53:06.833 --> 00:53:07.666
Fucker.

669
00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:10.166
I heard your dad's into men?

670
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:12.291
-Shut your fucking mouth.
-Fine.

671
00:53:12.375 --> 00:53:14.291
-What's up?
-I don't know, ask this fucker.

672
00:53:14.375 --> 00:53:15.875
-Just ask him.
-You need help?

673
00:53:19.375 --> 00:53:20.375
Dope!

674
00:53:21.541 --> 00:53:23.458
-Be careful, they're sharp.
-Careful.

675
00:53:23.541 --> 00:53:26.166
That's what I'm talking about.

676
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.458
Watch out.

677
00:53:28.833 --> 00:53:30.041
I'll take this one.

678
00:53:30.125 --> 00:53:31.750
-Let's go!
-Take this one too.

679
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:34.000
-Seriously, Jef?
-Take it.

680
00:53:35.166 --> 00:53:37.041
-Here, try this one.
-Hey.

681
00:53:46.083 --> 00:53:47.291
Pig!

682
00:53:49.041 --> 00:53:51.041
Hey, pig!

683
00:53:51.666 --> 00:53:56.083
As you can see,
things are getting out of control,

684
00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:57.458
and we can't distinguish...

685
00:53:57.541 --> 00:54:01.083
-Edwin!
-...the rioters from civilians...

686
00:54:01.166 --> 00:54:02.166
Pig!

687
00:54:14.083 --> 00:54:17.166
-Hey!
-Pig!

688
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:22.875
-Nothing.
-Pig!

689
00:54:22.958 --> 00:54:24.291
The plan's going well, Jef.

690
00:54:25.125 --> 00:54:27.750
Fucking security! Tell them to go home!

691
00:54:28.333 --> 00:54:31.000
Sir! Jefri and his gang are coming here!

692
00:54:31.083 --> 00:54:33.791
-They have machetes, crowbars and knives!
-Wait here.

693
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.791
-I'm coming with you!
-Let's go!

694
00:54:36.875 --> 00:54:38.083
Pig!

695
00:54:38.166 --> 00:54:39.541
You'll die today!

696
00:54:42.041 --> 00:54:44.375
Edwin! Let's play!

697
00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:51.666
Take the emergency exit upstairs.
I'll stall them.

698
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:53.666
-Quick!
-No, we must stick together!

699
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:56.208
They came for me.
It has nothing to do with you all!

700
00:54:56.291 --> 00:54:58.375
Hey! Pig!

701
00:54:58.958 --> 00:55:01.625
-Pig!
-Pig!

702
00:55:01.708 --> 00:55:02.791
Quick!

703
00:55:02.875 --> 00:55:04.083
Come with us!

704
00:55:04.666 --> 00:55:06.291
Where are you, pig teacher?

705
00:55:14.916 --> 00:55:17.333
Hey, pervert! Where are you hiding?

706
00:55:18.958 --> 00:55:20.083
This way!

707
00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.958
-Pig!
-Pig!

708
00:55:31.958 --> 00:55:34.000
-It's locked.
-Are you sure?

709
00:55:34.083 --> 00:55:35.625
The key's in the security room.

710
00:55:35.708 --> 00:55:38.666
What's the point of an emergency exit
if it's locked? Come on!

711
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:41.041
-Let's play!
-There's a package for you!

712
00:55:43.875 --> 00:55:46.000
Don't run like a pussy!

713
00:55:46.083 --> 00:55:48.291
-Shithead!
-Come out!

714
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:52.666
It's locked.

715
00:55:53.458 --> 00:55:55.000
Where are you, bastard!

716
00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:02.875
Run!

717
00:56:03.916 --> 00:56:04.958
Hey, pig!

718
00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.500
Fuck!

719
00:56:19.583 --> 00:56:20.958
Open the door!

720
00:56:22.791 --> 00:56:24.541
Open the fucking door!

721
00:56:24.625 --> 00:56:25.625
Pig!

722
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:35.750
Shit, there's no signal!

723
00:56:37.958 --> 00:56:41.000
We shouldn't have run away.
We don't have problems with them.

724
00:56:44.416 --> 00:56:47.125
My dad knows I'm here.
He'll come looking for me.

725
00:56:47.208 --> 00:56:50.750
Your dad didn't bat an eye when you left
for two days. He won't come!

726
00:56:50.833 --> 00:56:51.666
There's a riot.

727
00:56:54.083 --> 00:56:56.291
I saw the news on the TV
in the security room.

728
00:56:57.166 --> 00:56:58.666
Where are the guards?

729
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:59.875
They weren't there.

730
00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.541
They must've gone home
because of the riot.

731
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.375
I'll go out there and face them.

732
00:57:07.125 --> 00:57:07.958
Sir!

733
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:12.791
They'll leave you alone
when they get what they want.

734
00:57:12.875 --> 00:57:14.333
It's me they want.

735
00:57:17.583 --> 00:57:20.375
What do you think they came here for
with all those weapons?

736
00:57:21.333 --> 00:57:24.166
One thing is for sure, they won't kill me.

737
00:57:24.916 --> 00:57:26.333
They will kill you.

738
00:57:28.583 --> 00:57:29.875
Why do you say that?

739
00:57:29.958 --> 00:57:31.500
They've killed someone before.

740
00:57:32.791 --> 00:57:34.250
At least, Jefri did.

741
00:57:34.333 --> 00:57:36.333
I used to hang out with their gang.

742
00:57:36.416 --> 00:57:38.916
One night, when I was alone with Jefri,

743
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.875
he was very drunk
and confessed to me he'd killed someone.

744
00:57:42.583 --> 00:57:43.583
Who?

745
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:46.791
Ody Nugroho.

746
00:57:46.875 --> 00:57:48.291
Jefri killed him?

747
00:57:48.916 --> 00:57:51.875
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Keep it quiet!

748
00:57:54.041 --> 00:57:55.458
I didn't believe him at first.

749
00:57:55.958 --> 00:57:59.041
He emailed me the video from his cloud
to prove he killed Ody.

750
00:57:59.125 --> 00:58:01.000
-But I never opened it.
-Why?

751
00:58:01.083 --> 00:58:02.750
I was too scared. I was shocked!

752
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.416
If I delete the data,
I'll forget about it.

753
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.916
He sent you the video.

754
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.583
We only need to leak it
and it'll go viral.

755
00:58:09.666 --> 00:58:12.291
It's not that easy, you fool!
I didn't see the video!

756
00:58:12.375 --> 00:58:13.791
The face could be blurry!

757
00:58:13.875 --> 00:58:16.041
-I didn't know why he sent it to me.
-Calm down, man.

758
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.500
He sent it to you
because he needed an audience.

759
00:58:22.875 --> 00:58:25.291
Why didn't you go to the police?

760
00:58:25.666 --> 00:58:27.541
I was very scared, miss.

761
00:58:28.291 --> 00:58:31.000
If I'm not careful,
I'm sure Jefri will kill me too.

762
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:33.291
Right?

763
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.375
Let me see the video.

764
00:58:38.458 --> 00:58:40.625
-What for?
-We have to know how fucked up he is.

765
00:58:42.208 --> 00:58:43.583
Let's watch it.

766
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:46.125
He sent the video under an alias. Wait.

767
00:58:48.708 --> 00:58:49.583
Here it is.

768
00:58:51.416 --> 00:58:53.750
Watch this video, you shitheads.
Don't mess with me!

769
00:58:54.833 --> 00:58:56.041
Shit, there's no signal.

770
00:58:57.583 --> 00:59:02.041
Hey! Give me the pig,
and I'll let you all go home!

771
00:59:02.625 --> 00:59:04.208
Don't do it, sir. Ignore them.

772
00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:06.083
It's fine. I'm the one
they're looking for.

773
00:59:06.541 --> 00:59:08.916
They will kill you,

774
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.750
and they won't let us live
because we're all witnesses.

775
00:59:12.208 --> 00:59:13.041
Fuck!

776
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.125
What's that room?

777
00:59:18.666 --> 00:59:20.583
The locker room.
There's no way out in there.

778
00:59:20.666 --> 00:59:21.666
He's right.

779
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:24.708
-Wait, what are you going to do?
-No!

780
00:59:25.208 --> 00:59:26.958
The front and back doors use the same key.

781
00:59:27.041 --> 00:59:29.833
-The back door leads to the parking lot.
-He's right.

782
00:59:31.458 --> 00:59:33.000
Come on, sir. Quick.

783
00:59:33.083 --> 00:59:34.583
-Let me try.
-Come on.

784
00:59:41.583 --> 00:59:42.583
It's clogged!

785
00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:53.833
The number you have reached
is not in service.

786
01:00:05.291 --> 01:00:06.291
Rangga!

787
01:00:11.958 --> 01:00:13.875
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

788
01:00:15.541 --> 01:00:16.750
I'm Rangga's father.

789
01:00:17.583 --> 01:00:18.833
Is Rangga inside?

790
01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:22.291
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, he's here. We'll take you to him.

791
01:00:23.416 --> 01:00:27.250
-Do you want to come inside? Wait.
-Sure.

792
01:00:29.333 --> 01:00:31.333
Please come inside.

793
01:00:31.916 --> 01:00:33.208
Rangga!

794
01:00:34.625 --> 01:00:36.958
Don't you know there are riots everywhere?

795
01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:40.291
-We know, sir.
-Why don't you go home, then?

796
01:00:40.958 --> 01:00:42.666
Your parents must be worried.

797
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:44.750
-Our parents told us to stay here.
-Yeah.

798
01:00:44.833 --> 01:00:47.541
-They said it's safer here.
-How can it be safer?

799
01:00:47.625 --> 01:00:49.916
You can see the smoke from here!

800
01:00:51.541 --> 01:00:52.875
What are you doing here anyway?

801
01:00:52.958 --> 01:00:54.666
We're doing homework together!

802
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.000
That's nonsense.

803
01:01:00.375 --> 01:01:01.625
Why are you all here?

804
01:01:01.708 --> 01:01:03.916
-Hello, sir.
-Where is Rangga?

805
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.375
-He's in there.
-Yes.

806
01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:07.291
Rangga!

807
01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:08.625
Rangga!

808
01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:13.333
Dad! Run! Call the police!

809
01:01:13.416 --> 01:01:14.291
Dad!

810
01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:23.666
Rangga! Your dad is here for you, bastard!

811
01:01:24.041 --> 01:01:25.833
Get out now or we will kill him!

812
01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.750
Leave him alone!

813
01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:30.875
Don't come out! Stay inside!

814
01:01:33.541 --> 01:01:34.666
Take that!

815
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:35.833
Dad!

816
01:01:36.666 --> 01:01:37.958
Fuck you, Gerry!

817
01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:43.125
A riot that just erupted 15 minutes ago
is spreading through the city.

818
01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:48.166
Looting and vandalism are happening
everywhere and rapidly,

819
01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:52.208
taking us back to the riot
that happened 17 years ago.

820
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:55.916
Now we can see...

821
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.250
Calm down, Rangga.

822
01:01:58.958 --> 01:02:00.208
-How can I do that?
-Calm down.

823
01:02:01.125 --> 01:02:03.250
Even if I try to,
I will get killed myself.

824
01:02:03.333 --> 01:02:04.916
-Calm down.
-What do I do?

825
01:02:05.666 --> 01:02:07.958
It's too dangerous, Rangga. Be patient.

826
01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:13.416
I'll go out there.

827
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.583
I'll go out.

828
01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:26.958
What do you guys want?

829
01:02:31.625 --> 01:02:33.500
I promise you,

830
01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:39.375
none of us will tell the police.

831
01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:46.958
If you let us go,

832
01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:49.166
we promise...

833
01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:51.375
We promise.

834
01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:56.125
Please, before this goes too far.

835
01:02:57.583 --> 01:02:59.291
-Please.
-Too far?

836
01:03:03.291 --> 01:03:04.958
You mean after all of them are dead?

837
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.750
Jef, maybe...

838
01:03:09.375 --> 01:03:11.083
Maybe he's right, Jef.

839
01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:15.208
-Are you turning against me?
-Let me handle this, Jef.

840
01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.291
You know he's a pussy, right?
He has no balls.

841
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.833
What the hell?

842
01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:26.125
Don't be stupid.

843
01:03:39.333 --> 01:03:40.916
What are you doing?

844
01:03:48.875 --> 01:03:50.916
Dad!

845
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.458
Quit talking!

846
01:03:54.666 --> 01:03:57.666
Hey, what's with you? Such a crybaby.

847
01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:01.000
This is nothing
compared to what you've done!

848
01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:02.833
Did you forget? Look here!

849
01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:06.458
Look! Satisfied?

850
01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:08.083
I didn't do that to you.

851
01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:10.583
All parents are the same.

852
01:04:10.958 --> 01:04:12.250
Go on, Gerry.

853
01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:17.583
Jefri! You fucker! Bastard!

854
01:04:24.583 --> 01:04:25.416
Jef!

855
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:28.875
Jef!

856
01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:38.375
Yes, pig?

857
01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:39.833
What do you want?

858
01:04:39.916 --> 01:04:41.625
I want you to get out!

859
01:04:43.125 --> 01:04:45.250
Fine, I'll come out.

860
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.125
After you let all of them go!

861
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.250
I wonder how such an idiot like you
can be a teacher.

862
01:04:53.333 --> 01:04:55.708
We've got this far,
how could I let them go?

863
01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:57.666
Jef! Listen to me!

864
01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:00.625
I'm…

865
01:05:01.666 --> 01:05:03.125
I'm sorry.

866
01:05:03.208 --> 01:05:06.416
I'm sorry if I was out of line
with all the things I said. I was wrong.

867
01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:09.958
Okay? But think about your family.

868
01:05:10.625 --> 01:05:14.125
They must be worried about you.
I'm sure they love you, Jef.

869
01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:15.666
Enough! Shut up!

870
01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:17.625
Fuck you!

871
01:05:22.458 --> 01:05:23.583
Jef!

872
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Jef!

873
01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:45.958
-This is all because of you!
-Hey! Rangga!

874
01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:47.583
It's all because of you!

875
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:51.000
-Yes, it's all my fault.
-Fuck.

876
01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:53.250
-Stop, Rangga!
-I'm sorry.

877
01:05:53.833 --> 01:05:55.333
-I'm sorry.
-Stop it!

878
01:05:56.083 --> 01:05:57.583
Fuck you!

879
01:05:57.666 --> 01:05:59.958
-Fuck you!
-Rangga!

880
01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:02.958
My dad is dying out there because of you!

881
01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:04.250
Calm down, Rangga!

882
01:06:04.958 --> 01:06:06.541
Calm down.

883
01:06:06.916 --> 01:06:08.666
Do you even know how it feels?

884
01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:26.250
You open that door, and we all die.

885
01:06:27.041 --> 01:06:28.166
Is that what you want?

886
01:06:34.708 --> 01:06:35.708
Fuck this.

887
01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.083
There are eight of them, right?

888
01:06:43.916 --> 01:06:45.208
Yes, as I remember.

889
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.625
-Rangga.
-What?

890
01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.916
Was that all of them
when you saw them come in?

891
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.083
Yes.

892
01:06:52.166 --> 01:06:54.583
-You know all of them?
-Yes.

893
01:07:00.166 --> 01:07:03.333
-Jefri, I'll come out.
-Then come out!

894
01:07:03.416 --> 01:07:06.750
I will come out last,
after you let everyone go.

895
01:07:09.708 --> 01:07:12.166
-That's bullshit.
-We talked about that.

896
01:07:12.666 --> 01:07:13.875
No, Jef.

897
01:07:13.958 --> 01:07:16.875
I'm the one you want! I'll come out!

898
01:07:18.291 --> 01:07:19.958
So, how is this going to work?

899
01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:21.416
You all back off.

900
01:07:22.041 --> 01:07:25.500
Then Miss Diana, Khristo,
Rangga, and his dad will go.

901
01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.250
Only after they're safe
outside of the school,

902
01:07:29.041 --> 01:07:30.541
I'll come out.

903
01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:33.458
How will you know if we all backed off?

904
01:07:33.541 --> 01:07:35.333
Shout out your names one by one.

905
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:37.583
Are you seriously taking attendance?

906
01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:40.000
Do you want me to come out or not?

907
01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:44.250
Back off.

908
01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:46.250
Back off!

909
01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:48.833
Fuck this shit.

910
01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:52.541
-Shitheads.
-Pigs!

911
01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.708
Edwin, you pig!

912
01:07:59.291 --> 01:08:00.708
We have backed off!

913
01:08:01.583 --> 01:08:02.791
Now get out!

914
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.541
Get ready.

915
01:08:05.625 --> 01:08:08.166
Say your names, one by one!

916
01:08:09.333 --> 01:08:10.250
Dickhead!

917
01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:11.958
-Jefri!
-Gerry!

918
01:08:12.041 --> 01:08:13.166
-Reihan!
-Sim!

919
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.708
-Culap!
-Jay!

920
01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:15.750
Anto!

921
01:08:16.458 --> 01:08:17.958
You bitch!

922
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:21.583
Okay, now get them out, pig teacher!

923
01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:33.375
The pig's finally out.

924
01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:35.291
This fucker.

925
01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:47.458
-Fuck!
-Hey!

926
01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:53.708
You fucker!

927
01:08:53.791 --> 01:08:55.916
-Dad...
-Are you okay?

928
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:56.833
Sit here, Dad.

929
01:09:09.958 --> 01:09:11.166
Why?

930
01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:13.333
Why?

931
01:09:15.083 --> 01:09:16.708
Why didn't you let us out?

932
01:09:18.416 --> 01:09:20.375
Why didn't you let us out?

933
01:09:20.458 --> 01:09:21.833
I don't trust those guys.

934
01:09:22.916 --> 01:09:23.750
Fuck.

935
01:09:23.833 --> 01:09:25.125
Rangga.

936
01:09:25.208 --> 01:09:27.541
Mr. Edwin is right. They're dangerous.

937
01:09:27.625 --> 01:09:31.000
No. I'm sorry, miss.
But it was the right plan!

938
01:09:40.291 --> 01:09:41.416
Let's go home, Dad.

939
01:09:41.958 --> 01:09:43.333
We must go home, Dad.

940
01:09:43.416 --> 01:09:45.000
We'll go home, Dad.

941
01:09:45.083 --> 01:09:48.166
My dad needs medical attention.

942
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.208
We have to get out, sir.

943
01:10:08.416 --> 01:10:09.541
Jefri!

944
01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:11.250
What now, pig?

945
01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:12.916
I'm sorry.

946
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.291
We just wanted to make sure
Rangga's father was still alive.

947
01:10:16.375 --> 01:10:19.458
-Son of a bitch!
-What a load of bullshit!

948
01:10:19.541 --> 01:10:23.083
No, our deal is still on, Jef.
I will come out.

949
01:10:23.166 --> 01:10:24.750
I don't trust you anymore.

950
01:10:27.166 --> 01:10:28.625
You have to, Jef!

951
01:10:29.333 --> 01:10:32.666
There's nothing else we can do,
but to get out. Believe me!

952
01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:36.750
-Back off.
-They just came out.

953
01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:39.541
-Again, Jef?
-Back off!

954
01:10:40.958 --> 01:10:43.041
-How stupid.
-Shut your mouth.

955
01:10:44.125 --> 01:10:45.750
-What is this?
-You know...

956
01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:51.541
Okay. Get out now!

957
01:10:51.625 --> 01:10:54.250
Don't make us say our names again,
you bitch!

958
01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:57.416
No, Jef. Say your names one by one!

959
01:10:58.583 --> 01:10:59.916
Fucker!

960
01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:02.541
Jefri!

961
01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:04.500
-Gerry!
-Reihan!

962
01:11:04.583 --> 01:11:06.333
-Sim!
-Culap!

963
01:11:06.416 --> 01:11:07.875
-Jay!
-Anto!

964
01:11:07.958 --> 01:11:10.041
Get out, you motherfuckers!

965
01:11:12.041 --> 01:11:13.291
-Rangga.
-What's this?

966
01:11:13.375 --> 01:11:16.833
After you get out, open that door
from the outside. Can you do that?

967
01:11:18.791 --> 01:11:20.208
-Can you?
-Sir!

968
01:11:20.291 --> 01:11:22.416
If they took the keys,
we won't be able to get out.

969
01:11:23.416 --> 01:11:25.291
Rangga, you will open the door, right?

970
01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:33.875
-Ready?
-Let's do it.

971
01:11:49.791 --> 01:11:50.875
Don't be scared.

972
01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:15.208
Fucker.

973
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:17.625
I'll laugh if you fall.

974
01:12:18.791 --> 01:12:19.791
I hope you trip.

975
01:12:21.208 --> 01:12:22.833
What are we going to do now?

976
01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:27.291
We need to make sure they get out safely.

977
01:12:29.166 --> 01:12:30.708
They'll be safe.

978
01:12:30.791 --> 01:12:32.833
Stay away, Jef.

979
01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.375
Don't come any closer.

980
01:12:35.458 --> 01:12:36.541
Relax.

981
01:12:37.208 --> 01:12:40.708
-I'm not a liar like you, pig.
-Jef.

982
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I'm not a pig.

983
01:12:45.625 --> 01:12:46.875
I'm not a coward.

984
01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:49.250
And I'm not one to easily lose a fight!

985
01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.375
Wait until both of them get out, Jef!

986
01:12:56.458 --> 01:12:59.250
Hey, they will be safe.

987
01:13:00.083 --> 01:13:01.625
By the way, Mr. Edwin,

988
01:13:02.208 --> 01:13:05.250
if they are safe, I want you to get out

989
01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:07.208
and kiss my feet.

990
01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:16.583
What's next?

991
01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:19.666
We wait.

992
01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:38.625
Edwin.

993
01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:42.541
It's been 15 minutes.

994
01:13:44.791 --> 01:13:45.958
Maybe he forgot?

995
01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.791
Jefri.

996
01:13:53.166 --> 01:13:54.208
Jefri.

997
01:13:56.291 --> 01:13:57.291
Jef!

998
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:01.708
Jefri!

999
01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:04.208
Yes, pig?

1000
01:14:04.958 --> 01:14:06.750
Rangga and his dad haven't left!

1001
01:14:06.833 --> 01:14:08.625
Who said that? They left ages ago.

1002
01:14:08.708 --> 01:14:10.500
No, they're still here!

1003
01:14:10.583 --> 01:14:12.583
Now you come out
and let's get this over with.

1004
01:14:12.666 --> 01:14:15.250
No! I know they're still here!

1005
01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:18.416
Are you calling me a liar,
or is this another trick of yours?

1006
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.333
I know they're still here!

1007
01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:22.416
Fuck this shit.

1008
01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:25.291
Gerry! Come here!

1009
01:14:27.208 --> 01:14:28.333
Mr. Edwin!

1010
01:14:29.583 --> 01:14:33.291
You promised me, Jef!

1011
01:14:34.458 --> 01:14:35.875
Come on.

1012
01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:37.708
Just get out already.

1013
01:14:37.791 --> 01:14:40.458
Let's talk about this.

1014
01:14:40.541 --> 01:14:41.833
But only if you get out now!

1015
01:14:42.875 --> 01:14:43.750
Rangga!

1016
01:14:43.833 --> 01:14:47.333
We both know banging the door
won't do you any good.

1017
01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:52.791
Jef, he's not coming out.

1018
01:14:52.875 --> 01:14:54.916
There's no other choice.
We can't wait until tomorrow.

1019
01:14:56.166 --> 01:14:57.166
Reihan!

1020
01:14:58.208 --> 01:14:59.375
Jef, stop this.

1021
01:15:00.833 --> 01:15:02.083
Stop it, Jef.

1022
01:15:05.125 --> 01:15:07.458
-Get some gasoline.
-Where do I get gasoline?

1023
01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:09.625
From Gerry's car. Find a jerrican.

1024
01:15:09.708 --> 01:15:10.916
How about the hose?

1025
01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:14.958
Use your fucking mouth
or whatever necessary.

1026
01:15:17.416 --> 01:15:18.625
Quick!

1027
01:15:22.833 --> 01:15:24.041
What's your plan?

1028
01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:46.291
POLICE

1029
01:15:51.041 --> 01:15:52.583
Hey. What are you doing?

1030
01:15:53.583 --> 01:15:54.458
Sir.

1031
01:15:55.333 --> 01:15:56.375
This is...

1032
01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:58.875
My friend's car broke down.

1033
01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:00.375
Ran out of gas.

1034
01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:02.416
I'm taking some from this car.

1035
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.791
-Whose car is this?
-It's mine, sir.

1036
01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:06.541
Do you have the car's papers?

1037
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.750
Actually, this is my friend's car, sir.

1038
01:16:10.833 --> 01:16:12.708
Another friend of mine.

1039
01:16:13.875 --> 01:16:15.666
Then where are your friends?

1040
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:17.458
-Which one?
-Both of them.

1041
01:16:17.541 --> 01:16:20.416
The one who owns this car
and the one who's run out of gas.

1042
01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:21.791
They're at school, sir.

1043
01:16:24.083 --> 01:16:25.833
-Is this your school?
-Yes, sir.

1044
01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:28.750
Show me your friends.

1045
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:32.333
Right away, sir.

1046
01:16:33.083 --> 01:16:34.041
Unit 21.

1047
01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:36.666
Hold on. Yes, copy.

1048
01:16:37.333 --> 01:16:38.666
We need more help here.

1049
01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.625
Let's go.

1050
01:16:41.875 --> 01:16:43.208
Yes, roger that.

1051
01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.333
-Is this really your school?
-I swear.

1052
01:16:46.416 --> 01:16:49.666
If you don't believe me,
come here tomorrow. I'll be here.

1053
01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:52.333
Fine.

1054
01:16:52.416 --> 01:16:55.875
If you kids are going home,
take the south route. It's safer.

1055
01:16:55.958 --> 01:16:57.708
-Will do, sir.
-Fine.

1056
01:16:59.583 --> 01:17:00.583
Let's go.

1057
01:17:02.916 --> 01:17:05.208
If he wanted to steal,
he'd steal the car, not the gas.

1058
01:17:10.166 --> 01:17:13.000
What do you think?
Let's burn the school down.

1059
01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:14.208
Stupid.

1060
01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:16.916
If we burn it down,
then we also have to get out.

1061
01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:20.041
And there's no way for me
to make sure they're dead.

1062
01:17:20.125 --> 01:17:21.125
Idiot!

1063
01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:24.083
-So, what do we do, Jef?
-Fuck!

1064
01:17:31.666 --> 01:17:32.666
Edwin!

1065
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:35.833
I'll count to five!

1066
01:17:36.958 --> 01:17:38.416
If you don't get out,

1067
01:17:39.458 --> 01:17:41.333
I'll set Rangga's dad on fire!

1068
01:17:46.291 --> 01:17:47.125
Please, Jef!

1069
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:50.250
One!

1070
01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:52.750
Two!

1071
01:17:53.416 --> 01:17:54.625
Three!

1072
01:17:56.166 --> 01:17:57.250
Four!

1073
01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:02.708
No!

1074
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Five!

1075
01:18:21.791 --> 01:18:22.875
Out of the way!

1076
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.666
Dad!

1077
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:39.833
Dad!

1078
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:43.833
Dad...

1079
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:50.833
Dad...

1080
01:19:06.916 --> 01:19:07.791
Help!

1081
01:19:08.666 --> 01:19:10.416
Help!

1082
01:19:10.958 --> 01:19:12.250
Help!

1083
01:19:12.833 --> 01:19:14.208
Help!

1084
01:19:25.291 --> 01:19:26.875
Hey! Get him!

1085
01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:51.916
Rangga!

1086
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.541
-Rangga!
-What, fucker?

1087
01:19:53.625 --> 01:19:55.791
You can't get out!
Where do you want to go?

1088
01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:57.708
You killed my dad!

1089
01:19:57.791 --> 01:20:00.083
-We know!
-My dad is dead!

1090
01:20:00.166 --> 01:20:02.208
-Yes, we know that!
-I don't have a dad anymore!

1091
01:20:03.125 --> 01:20:05.583
-Come join us.
-To hell with you!

1092
01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:07.708
-Calm down.
-No!

1093
01:20:08.208 --> 01:20:09.916
-Calm down.
-No!

1094
01:20:15.666 --> 01:20:16.708
Fuck!

1095
01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.666
-Why did you do that, you fool?
-Shut up!

1096
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:44.625
-Why did you kill him?
-He was going to stab you!

1097
01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:47.125
Why did you do that?

1098
01:20:47.208 --> 01:20:49.125
He was going to stab you!
You want to die too?

1099
01:20:49.208 --> 01:20:50.791
Protect your loved ones...

1100
01:20:50.875 --> 01:20:52.041
Fuck!

1101
01:20:52.125 --> 01:20:57.750
The life insurance we offer
will secure your family's future.

1102
01:20:59.375 --> 01:21:00.833
He was our friend!

1103
01:21:01.791 --> 01:21:03.333
Were we supposed to let him go?

1104
01:21:03.416 --> 01:21:05.583
Did you want him to report us to the cops?

1105
01:21:05.666 --> 01:21:08.333
Insurance for a brighter future.

1106
01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:54.875
Sim, are you crying?

1107
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:57.833
Hey.

1108
01:21:59.666 --> 01:22:00.583
Are you crying?

1109
01:22:02.791 --> 01:22:03.916
Why are you crying?

1110
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.208
I just want to go home, Jef.

1111
01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:07.625
Go home?

1112
01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:10.833
Do you want to join them there?

1113
01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:19.166
I just don't want...

1114
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:21.416
I don't want anyone else to die.

1115
01:22:23.083 --> 01:22:24.541
You don't want anyone else to die?

1116
01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:27.791
Do you want to tell that
to all the people out there?

1117
01:22:28.541 --> 01:22:30.208
After this is over, what will you do?

1118
01:22:32.125 --> 01:22:34.166
Cry? Do you want to cry?

1119
01:22:34.458 --> 01:22:37.458
Just cry. Go on.

1120
01:22:38.416 --> 01:22:39.583
What a crybaby.

1121
01:22:40.458 --> 01:22:41.416
Don't cry.

1122
01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:43.708
Go on. Cry again.

1123
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.750
Is that your plan?

1124
01:22:48.333 --> 01:22:50.166
-Report us to the cops?
-No, Jef.

1125
01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:51.958
-No.
-Then what's your plan?

1126
01:22:52.041 --> 01:22:53.083
Jef.

1127
01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:55.916
What's your plan now?

1128
01:23:00.583 --> 01:23:02.333
It's not my plan.

1129
01:23:03.125 --> 01:23:04.583
It's our plan.

1130
01:23:07.333 --> 01:23:09.583
We kill everyone in there.

1131
01:23:10.041 --> 01:23:12.750
Then we throw their bodies
into the burning buildings out there!

1132
01:23:13.875 --> 01:23:15.458
No one will know who killed them.

1133
01:23:16.333 --> 01:23:17.541
You got that?

1134
01:23:17.916 --> 01:23:19.333
Okay, Jef.

1135
01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:22.541
-You got that?
-Yes, Jef.

1136
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Who else wants to cry?

1137
01:23:26.375 --> 01:23:27.500
Who else?

1138
01:23:34.166 --> 01:23:36.166
There has to be a way out of here.

1139
01:23:41.166 --> 01:23:42.500
Don't follow us, Khristo.

1140
01:23:42.916 --> 01:23:45.125
Stay near the door
so they don't suspect anything.

1141
01:23:45.208 --> 01:23:46.125
Yes.

1142
01:23:59.583 --> 01:24:02.083
Hey. Stop! Stay near the door!

1143
01:24:02.166 --> 01:24:03.791
-I want to come too!
-No.

1144
01:24:04.458 --> 01:24:08.041
Bang the door from time to time
so they won't get suspicious. Go!

1145
01:24:33.375 --> 01:24:34.833
The principal was right.

1146
01:24:36.416 --> 01:24:38.041
I'm just another problem to deal with.

1147
01:24:41.083 --> 01:24:43.000
I shouldn't have come to this school.

1148
01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:47.375
And my goal wasn't even to teach.

1149
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.333
What was it, then?

1150
01:24:57.916 --> 01:24:59.208
My sister was raped.

1151
01:25:02.166 --> 01:25:04.000
During the riots 17 years ago.

1152
01:25:06.125 --> 01:25:07.375
In front of my own eyes.

1153
01:25:09.208 --> 01:25:10.125
She got pregnant.

1154
01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:14.291
And she gave her son away.

1155
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.125
Two years ago,

1156
01:25:20.791 --> 01:25:22.000
my sister died.

1157
01:25:26.583 --> 01:25:27.958
Acute pneumonia.

1158
01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:32.750
She had looked for her son before,
and she told me

1159
01:25:32.833 --> 01:25:36.500
there's a high chance that her son
attends a high school in the east.

1160
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:39.125
Do you know his name?

1161
01:25:40.166 --> 01:25:41.458
She didn't say.

1162
01:25:45.416 --> 01:25:47.583
Today, I brought Khristo here to find out.

1163
01:25:48.916 --> 01:25:49.958
Find out what?

1164
01:25:51.166 --> 01:25:52.791
I think he's my sister's son.

1165
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:57.375
Everyone in my family drew well,
and Khristo draws well.

1166
01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:05.500
Diana, Khristo must live.

1167
01:26:05.708 --> 01:26:10.125
Hey, pig.

1168
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:16.583
Pig!

1169
01:26:40.708 --> 01:26:42.208
Do you know where this leads to?

1170
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:44.583
No.

1171
01:26:55.291 --> 01:26:57.750
Do you know where the signal scrambler is?

1172
01:26:58.958 --> 01:27:01.625
-In the security room.
-Okay.

1173
01:27:08.666 --> 01:27:11.333
When I get there, I will turn if off.
You have a phone, right?

1174
01:27:12.958 --> 01:27:15.666
-Stand by. I'll call when it's off.
-Okay.

1175
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.125
Be careful, Win.

1176
01:27:43.583 --> 01:27:44.708
Where are you going, Sim?

1177
01:27:45.708 --> 01:27:46.583
To pee.

1178
01:27:49.416 --> 01:27:50.416
I'll come with you.

1179
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:55.750
Bring that.

1180
01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:33.750
Do you guys also want to pee?

1181
01:28:43.208 --> 01:28:45.875
Don't you need to guard the gym?

1182
01:28:45.958 --> 01:28:46.833
No need.

1183
01:28:48.541 --> 01:28:50.875
-Do you also want to pee?
-Yes.

1184
01:28:51.916 --> 01:28:53.375
Why do you bring a machete to pee?

1185
01:28:53.958 --> 01:28:55.666
You haven't been circumcised, right?

1186
01:29:06.416 --> 01:29:07.458
What are you doing?

1187
01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:09.000
Taking a dump.

1188
01:29:26.583 --> 01:29:27.416
Hey!

1189
01:29:28.291 --> 01:29:29.291
Jef!

1190
01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:31.458
Jef, stop!

1191
01:29:34.125 --> 01:29:35.291
Please, Jef!

1192
01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:51.458
Why did you kill him?

1193
01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:06.125
Didn't you want to pee?

1194
01:30:18.833 --> 01:30:20.208
I don't believe it.

1195
01:30:20.958 --> 01:30:22.500
Be quiet for now.

1196
01:30:31.833 --> 01:30:32.666
Where's Sim?

1197
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.291
...in several areas in Jakarta.

1198
01:31:38.416 --> 01:31:41.541
The rioters, estimated to be
around 3,000 people,

1199
01:31:41.666 --> 01:31:44.583
are involved in unstoppable mass lootings.

1200
01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.458
The incident started earlier
this afternoon,

1201
01:31:46.541 --> 01:31:48.333
and remains uncontrollable as of now.

1202
01:31:48.416 --> 01:31:52.458
The crowds are very violent.

1203
01:31:52.541 --> 01:31:56.416
The shopping district in East Jakarta is
one of the most severely affected areas

1204
01:31:56.500 --> 01:32:00.416
where dozens of stores are being
destroyed and looted ruthlessly.

1205
01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:04.166
This situation escalated
when rioters threw

1206
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:06.750
stones and Molotov cocktails
at police cars,

1207
01:32:06.833 --> 01:32:09.708
forcing the police to withdraw.

1208
01:32:09.791 --> 01:32:13.833
Civilians were left frightened
when these events unfolded.

1209
01:32:13.958 --> 01:32:17.166
Some have evacuated themselves
to safer areas.

1210
01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:19.708
We managed to interview a witness

1211
01:32:19.791 --> 01:32:22.791
who described this situation
as "hell street."

1212
01:32:22.875 --> 01:32:25.875
-Thank you for agreeing to speak with us.
-Yes, miss.

1213
01:32:25.958 --> 01:32:28.708
Could you tell us
what has been happening here?

1214
01:32:28.833 --> 01:32:33.583
At first, there was only a small crowd.

1215
01:32:33.666 --> 01:32:35.500
They were screaming
and holding up banners.

1216
01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:40.208
By noon, they grew in size
and turned chaotic.

1217
01:32:40.833 --> 01:32:43.708
They smashed windows,
destroying all in their path.

1218
01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:46.291
Poor shop owners can only run in fear.

1219
01:32:46.375 --> 01:32:48.666
I didn't see shop owners getting hurt,

1220
01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:51.625
they were only trying to
protect their shops.

1221
01:32:51.708 --> 01:32:54.583
There were many injured and scared.

1222
01:32:56.166 --> 01:32:58.041
How many people were involved
in the riot?

1223
01:32:58.125 --> 01:32:59.583
There were countless of them.

1224
01:32:59.666 --> 01:33:03.000
If I had to guess, I'd say there were
more than 1,000 on this street alone.

1225
01:33:03.083 --> 01:33:05.708
They were fearless, as if
this had been planned before.

1226
01:33:05.833 --> 01:33:09.250
Some were carrying wood, steel pipes,
even burning bottles.

1227
01:33:09.333 --> 01:33:11.500
They were rampaging as if nothing
mattered at all.

1228
01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.625
They will attack anyone who passed by.

1229
01:33:14.708 --> 01:33:18.041
Was there any police nearby
to control the situation?

1230
01:33:18.166 --> 01:33:21.875
They came with shields
to disperse the riots.

1231
01:33:21.958 --> 01:33:24.583
But soon after,
the rioters attacked the police.

1232
01:33:24.666 --> 01:33:27.791
I saw the police getting pelted with
stones, some even fell to the ground.

1233
01:33:27.875 --> 01:33:30.375
They eventually got outnumbered
and then retreated.

1234
01:33:30.458 --> 01:33:33.041
Then what about the other civilians, sir?

1235
01:33:33.125 --> 01:33:35.583
What did they do to protect themselves?

1236
01:33:41.583 --> 01:33:42.791
Pig.

1237
01:33:45.791 --> 01:33:46.791
Edwin!

1238
01:33:50.416 --> 01:33:51.583
Edwin!

1239
01:33:54.666 --> 01:33:56.250
Edwin!

1240
01:33:56.333 --> 01:33:59.000
Why are you guys so quiet in there? Pig?

1241
01:34:01.791 --> 01:34:02.625
Miss.

1242
01:34:03.208 --> 01:34:04.250
Hey!

1243
01:34:08.416 --> 01:34:10.000
We're here, Jef.

1244
01:34:10.791 --> 01:34:12.333
I'm talking to Edwin, not you.

1245
01:34:12.916 --> 01:34:15.500
Where's my pig teacher?

1246
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:19.333
What are you guys planning to do there?

1247
01:34:19.416 --> 01:34:20.666
We're all here, Jef.

1248
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:23.833
Not you, fucker! Edwin!

1249
01:34:28.583 --> 01:34:29.750
Why are you guys so quiet?

1250
01:34:30.791 --> 01:34:32.291
Figure out how to open the door.

1251
01:34:33.875 --> 01:34:34.875
What?

1252
01:34:35.666 --> 01:34:37.333
-Use your brain, idiot.
-Jef.

1253
01:34:37.416 --> 01:34:40.708
I once saw people use a blowtorch
in the science lab.

1254
01:34:41.166 --> 01:34:42.958
Why didn't you say so earlier?

1255
01:34:43.041 --> 01:34:45.208
-Why didn't you?
-I'm sorry, Jef.

1256
01:34:45.291 --> 01:34:47.583
-I just remembered.
-Quick, get it now.

1257
01:34:48.125 --> 01:34:49.125
Anto!

1258
01:34:49.791 --> 01:34:52.708
What are you doing? Go get it!

1259
01:34:55.583 --> 01:34:56.833
Edwin!

1260
01:35:01.458 --> 01:35:02.875
Here it is, Jef!

1261
01:35:02.958 --> 01:35:05.375
-Why are you giving it to me? Do it!
-I don't know how.

1262
01:35:05.458 --> 01:35:08.250
-I'll burn your fucking face!
-I'll do it.

1263
01:35:10.083 --> 01:35:11.291
Give that to me.

1264
01:35:18.375 --> 01:35:19.791
Where is Edwin?

1265
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.125
Fuck!

1266
01:35:58.958 --> 01:35:59.958
You'll die!

1267
01:36:00.041 --> 01:36:02.000
-Fuck!
-Where did they go? Fucker!

1268
01:36:08.333 --> 01:36:10.625
Jef, look! The vent!

1269
01:36:11.708 --> 01:36:12.958
-Hey, Edwin!
-Edwin!

1270
01:36:14.125 --> 01:36:16.583
-Edwin!
-Where? Fuck! Shit!

1271
01:36:16.666 --> 01:36:18.083
We have to spread out! Quick!

1272
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:19.791
That fucker!

1273
01:36:30.625 --> 01:36:31.916
-Let's go.
-Whose blood is that?

1274
01:36:34.708 --> 01:36:36.375
We'll use the emergency exit upstairs.

1275
01:36:51.166 --> 01:36:53.375
I'm so sick of Jefri pushing us around.

1276
01:36:53.458 --> 01:36:58.166
Why don't you tell him that?
You don't have the guts, do you?

1277
01:36:58.250 --> 01:37:00.833
I mean, why is he
the proclaimed leader of the gang?

1278
01:37:00.916 --> 01:37:03.250
Can't you see that the kids
are sick of him already?

1279
01:37:03.708 --> 01:37:04.875
He's such a shithead.

1280
01:37:14.291 --> 01:37:15.708
I mean, they were close friends.

1281
01:37:15.791 --> 01:37:18.166
-You mean Sim?
-Yeah, Jefri and Sim.

1282
01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:20.208
-How could you kill your best friend?
-So what?

1283
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:22.166
That shit ain't right.

1284
01:37:23.583 --> 01:37:26.250
So what?
I think Jefri did the right thing.

1285
01:37:28.041 --> 01:37:29.166
Watch your fucking mouth.

1286
01:37:29.708 --> 01:37:31.875
-What did I say?
-Sim is also our friend.

1287
01:37:31.958 --> 01:37:34.125
-Hey, Sim was--
-That doesn't mean--

1288
01:37:34.208 --> 01:37:37.375
Well, Sim deserved it,
because he was such a pussy. A coward.

1289
01:37:37.458 --> 01:37:41.250
But that doesn't mean he deserved
to be killed by his own friend!

1290
01:37:42.208 --> 01:37:43.625
Have you thought about that?

1291
01:37:44.166 --> 01:37:46.750
He was still our friend
no matter what, shithead!

1292
01:37:47.666 --> 01:37:50.166
Talk about a pussy and a coward...

1293
01:37:50.875 --> 01:37:55.083
My dad is also a fucking coward.
He's a bigger pussy!

1294
01:37:56.208 --> 01:37:59.958
-But not like my dad!
-Fuck fathers!

1295
01:38:00.958 --> 01:38:02.041
Motherfuckers!

1296
01:38:04.708 --> 01:38:08.166
If my dad were a decent man,
I wouldn't be here at all!

1297
01:38:08.791 --> 01:38:11.750
I wouldn't be locked up
in this school! Fuck!

1298
01:38:11.833 --> 01:38:13.791
My dad is the biggest motherfucker!

1299
01:38:13.875 --> 01:38:17.375
This is the emergency exit key.
When it's safe, get out!

1300
01:38:18.666 --> 01:38:20.833
-Where are you going?
-I'll distract them.

1301
01:38:22.541 --> 01:38:24.166
When there's a signal,
call me immediately.

1302
01:38:24.250 --> 01:38:26.041
Keep the phone on silent mode.

1303
01:38:33.833 --> 01:38:36.625
You can use mine.
We'll use Miss Diana's phone.

1304
01:38:37.791 --> 01:38:39.541
Be careful, sir.

1305
01:38:39.625 --> 01:38:41.125
Who is the shittiest one?

1306
01:38:41.208 --> 01:38:44.541
-Our preys, you bitch!
-Fuck! Shit!

1307
01:38:45.125 --> 01:38:46.583
Fucker!

1308
01:38:46.666 --> 01:38:48.041
-Edwin!
-Edwin!

1309
01:38:48.916 --> 01:38:52.875
Bitch! Shit! Fucker! Fuck!

1310
01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.541
Who's that?

1311
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:03.333
-We after him?
-Mr. Fuckhead!

1312
01:39:03.416 --> 01:39:04.625
Fucker!

1313
01:39:12.375 --> 01:39:15.041
Viewers, I'm now at the heart
of the riot in Central Jakarta.

1314
01:39:15.125 --> 01:39:17.416
And it looks like the situation
is spiraling out of control.

1315
01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:18.333
Hey.

1316
01:39:18.458 --> 01:39:21.291
Thousands of rioters,
estimated over 3,000 people

1317
01:39:21.375 --> 01:39:24.291
continue to vent their anger
in violent outbursts.

1318
01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:29.041
Just a moment ago, I witnessed them
destroying public facilities.

1319
01:39:29.125 --> 01:39:32.208
Streetlights, bus stations were destroyed.

1320
01:39:32.791 --> 01:39:34.500
This hasn't gone too far yet.

1321
01:39:35.541 --> 01:39:39.500
We can still get out of this together.
Help me rescue the others. Come on.

1322
01:39:39.583 --> 01:39:41.833
-It's too late, you fucker!
-Motherfucker!

1323
01:40:03.875 --> 01:40:05.916
-Quick, To!
-Fucking teacher!

1324
01:40:13.875 --> 01:40:17.500
Anto!

1325
01:40:22.791 --> 01:40:25.166
-That's enough.
-Die, you fucker!

1326
01:40:53.208 --> 01:40:54.500
Die, bitch!

1327
01:40:57.625 --> 01:40:59.208
Fucker!

1328
01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:01.083
Die!

1329
01:41:28.333 --> 01:41:30.041
Go search for them right away.

1330
01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:40.125
Fucking pig!

1331
01:41:41.458 --> 01:41:43.250
Come here, pig!

1332
01:41:47.791 --> 01:41:50.041
I want to get out of here.
I'm not cut out for prison.

1333
01:41:50.125 --> 01:41:52.541
How can we get out anyway?
There's a riot out there.

1334
01:41:52.625 --> 01:41:57.291
If someone messes with me,
I'll tell them who my dad is.

1335
01:41:57.375 --> 01:42:00.500
Just give your dad's corruption money
to the poor, so it becomes halal.

1336
01:42:00.583 --> 01:42:05.916
He does that all the time already.
As long as he make the news.

1337
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.666
I want to be a hacker
so I can steal from the rich

1338
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:13.541
and give to the poor.
I don't want to be like my corrupt dad.

1339
01:42:15.125 --> 01:42:15.958
Fuck this shit.

1340
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:39.875
Enough.

1341
01:42:42.875 --> 01:42:43.708
Let's end this.

1342
01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:46.083
Enough.

1343
01:42:49.291 --> 01:42:51.250
Motherfucker!

1344
01:42:54.291 --> 01:42:56.291
Hold on to me! Throw your weapons away!

1345
01:42:56.375 --> 01:42:58.500
Throw it and hold on to me!

1346
01:43:01.083 --> 01:43:02.291
Pig!

1347
01:43:04.541 --> 01:43:05.500
Gerry!

1348
01:43:10.875 --> 01:43:12.416
We can leave now, miss.

1349
01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:14.625
-You need to know something about Edwin.
-What?

1350
01:43:15.375 --> 01:43:18.916
He didn't come here to teach,
but to search for his nephew.

1351
01:43:19.458 --> 01:43:20.708
Has he found him?

1352
01:43:21.208 --> 01:43:23.750
-He thinks you're his nephew.
-What?

1353
01:43:41.458 --> 01:43:43.750
I can't be his nephew, it's impossible.

1354
01:43:43.833 --> 01:43:44.958
How do you know?

1355
01:43:45.041 --> 01:43:47.375
My mom works overseas in Malaysia.
My father is Malaysian.

1356
01:43:47.458 --> 01:43:48.750
I was born there.

1357
01:43:48.833 --> 01:43:50.208
You don't know for sure, right?

1358
01:43:50.291 --> 01:43:52.541
I know for sure I'm not his nephew.

1359
01:43:54.875 --> 01:43:57.125
Unless his nephews are twins.

1360
01:43:57.708 --> 01:43:59.000
What do you mean?

1361
01:43:59.083 --> 01:44:01.458
I had an identical twin brother.

1362
01:44:01.541 --> 01:44:04.000
When my brother was ten,
he died in an accident.

1363
01:44:04.958 --> 01:44:06.708
After that, my family and I moved here.

1364
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:23.916
Enough, Jef.

1365
01:44:24.875 --> 01:44:27.041
Let's get out of here together.

1366
01:44:28.291 --> 01:44:30.166
-Come on, Jef.
-Fuck you!

1367
01:44:35.083 --> 01:44:37.541
You die! Die!

1368
01:45:09.708 --> 01:45:10.875
Lick it!

1369
01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:15.208
Lick it!

1370
01:46:20.791 --> 01:46:23.541
You disgusting fuck! Get off me!

1371
01:46:23.625 --> 01:46:25.875
-Enough, Jef!
-You disgusting fuck!

1372
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.791
Disgusting! Hey! Help!

1373
01:46:28.875 --> 01:46:30.250
-Hey!
-All of you, stop!

1374
01:46:30.333 --> 01:46:31.250
Help me.

1375
01:46:31.375 --> 01:46:32.875
We must get out now.

1376
01:46:33.250 --> 01:46:34.666
You trust me, right?

1377
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:35.708
Follow me.

1378
01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:37.916
You'll be safe and sound.

1379
01:46:38.416 --> 01:46:40.541
-Yeah? Okay? Let's go!
-Let's go.

1380
01:46:43.375 --> 01:46:45.541
Do you want to die for nothing,
or go to jail?

1381
01:46:45.625 --> 01:46:47.416
Think about your families!

1382
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.333
He's a murderer! You guys are not!

1383
01:46:50.416 --> 01:46:53.166
You still have a future! Get out, now!

1384
01:47:05.041 --> 01:47:06.625
You go first. Come on!

1385
01:47:07.041 --> 01:47:09.541
-You go first. I have to help Mr. Edwin.
-No, miss!

1386
01:47:10.041 --> 01:47:10.916
We'll get help.

1387
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.875
-But Mr. Edwin--
-No, miss!

1388
01:47:12.958 --> 01:47:15.250
If I go alone, I will get caught!

1389
01:47:15.333 --> 01:47:19.333
Please. It's dangerous, miss! Come on!

1390
01:47:22.875 --> 01:47:24.000
Let's go!

1391
01:47:30.291 --> 01:47:31.333
Help me. Hey!

1392
01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:39.875
Culap!

1393
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.250
Dotty!

1394
01:47:44.833 --> 01:47:47.000
Don't you dare leave me alone, Dotty!

1395
01:47:47.083 --> 01:47:49.208
Dot! Come here, Dotty!

1396
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:52.958
Dotty! Dot!

1397
01:47:53.041 --> 01:47:55.958
-Jefri, enough.
-Fuck you!

1398
01:48:13.375 --> 01:48:16.375
Why do you behave
like a devil's incarnate, Jef?

1399
01:48:16.458 --> 01:48:18.208
What did I do wrong?

1400
01:48:18.291 --> 01:48:21.000
What did I do?

1401
01:48:36.916 --> 01:48:41.333
What did I do wrong? Die!

1402
01:48:42.625 --> 01:48:44.250
I didn't do anything wrong!

1403
01:49:04.458 --> 01:49:05.291
Jef!

1404
01:49:08.125 --> 01:49:09.208
Jef.

1405
01:49:10.875 --> 01:49:11.875
Jefri.

1406
01:49:13.083 --> 01:49:15.791
Jef... I'm sorry.

1407
01:49:16.916 --> 01:49:18.083
I'm sorry.

1408
01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:22.041
Jef, I'm sorry.

1409
01:49:23.041 --> 01:49:23.875
Jef.

1410
01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:27.250
Jef.

1411
01:49:28.541 --> 01:49:29.375
Jef!

1412
01:49:30.375 --> 01:49:32.208
Jef!

1413
01:50:15.041 --> 01:50:21.291
In the east
the sun begins to shine brightly

1414
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:27.875
Rise up, stand up, my friends

1415
01:50:28.625 --> 01:50:34.916
Join our march in unity

1416
01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:40.333
For all the youth of Indonesia

1417
01:50:40.416 --> 01:50:41.791
You said I'm Chinese?

1418
01:50:44.208 --> 01:50:46.083
-Jef.
-Well, you're right!

1419
01:50:46.625 --> 01:50:47.916
My mom was Chinese.

1420
01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:49.708
She was gangraped.

1421
01:50:50.666 --> 01:50:52.416
-Are you happy now?
-Jef...

1422
01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:53.916
I have many fathers.

1423
01:50:54.375 --> 01:50:55.666
I'm like a pool of jizz.

1424
01:50:56.166 --> 01:50:57.583
Like garbage!

1425
01:50:58.750 --> 01:51:00.041
Are you happy now, bitch?

1426
01:51:11.458 --> 01:51:13.000
Fuck you, all!

1427
01:51:33.083 --> 01:51:35.708
-Hey! There's a Chinese here!
-A Chinese!

1428
01:51:38.458 --> 01:51:39.291
Get him!

1429
01:51:45.916 --> 01:51:47.875
Get in! Quick!

1430
01:51:49.208 --> 01:51:50.458
Get in now!

1431
01:52:26.958 --> 01:52:30.291
The situation is worsening
ever since the riot started this morning.

1432
01:52:30.375 --> 01:52:33.708
This is the worst riot ever.

1433
01:52:33.791 --> 01:52:36.833
Nobody understands
why this riot started in the first place.

1434
01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:39.000
I can only do what I can to help.

1435
01:52:39.666 --> 01:52:41.250
I'll drop you off somewhere safe.

1436
01:52:41.791 --> 01:52:43.541
Then I'll go back to save the others.

1437
01:52:49.666 --> 01:52:50.500
I'm Panca.
