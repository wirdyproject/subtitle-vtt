1
00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.208
Make sure Konco Seneng is ready.

2
00:00:58.208 --> 00:00:59.958
Konco Seneng, we're starting soon.

3
00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:01.208
Okay, miss.

4
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.291
Why say "okay"? Jeru isn't here yet.

5
00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.416
Seriously, I even told him to take
a private plane jet.

6
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.958
A plane or a private jet?

7
00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:10.500
A private plane

8
00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:11.458
that's a jet.

9
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:12.375
That's different.

10
00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:13.666
It's the same.

11
00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.041
Ever since Jeru started
going out with Bethari,

12
00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:19.791
he's been so hard to reach.

13
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:39.833
Where is he?

14
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.250
Maybe he's on his way, Rick.

15
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.750
CALLING

16
00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:41.208
It's her.

17
00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:48.000
His Highness Argo is here.

18
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:03.666
There he is! The keyboardist, Rick!

19
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.375
Aruna! The backup singer
who doubles as the manager.

20
00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:11.375
-Our keyboardist, Rick! Say hello, Rick!
-Hey, what are you doing?

21
00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.291
Planes and jets are different!

22
00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:16.166
What's the ruckus? Is your ukulele okay?

23
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.333
Forget my ukulele. What about his head?

24
00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:19.708
The band needs your ukulele, not his head.

25
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:21.000
Oh, he's Chip.

26
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.250
I'm Rontek.

27
00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:25.041
His teeth are chipped all right.

28
00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:28.375
Pick up, Thari.

29
00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:35.875
Up next, we have a band here
to give you a show.

30
00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.833
I'm sure this band is no stranger to you.

31
00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:47.541
They've performed at many events
and appeared everywhere.

32
00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:51.291
Let us all welcome…

33
00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:54.375
Konco Seneng!

34
00:03:58.208 --> 00:03:59.666
One, two, three.

35
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.166
LARA ATI STILL CARES
NATURAL DISASTER FUNDRAISING

36
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.583
Phew, I can finally breathe!

37
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:16.416
Your Highness,
if you want to go on a date,

38
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.875
don't go on the day of the ceremony.

39
00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:23.625
Aunty, Ngapem takes forever.

40
00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:27.208
What if I can't see Jeru?

41
00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:32.458
You know what His Highness Argo is like.

42
00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:36.041
Forget about it!

43
00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:40.125
What matters is I get to see
Jeru perform today.

44
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.291
I'm so happy.

45
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.291
You could at least
pick up the phone, babe.

46
00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:09.291
I was busy, babe.

47
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:11.958
There.

48
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:13.875
Here you go. All done.

49
00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:20.333
Let's go!

50
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.791
-Why is it taking so long?
-Where's the vocalist?

51
00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:40.500
Where is he?

52
00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:41.833
What's happening?

53
00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:44.708
What should we do?

54
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.916
If Jeru doesn't show up,
you take over as the vocalist.

55
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.291
Sing one of your keroncong songs.

56
00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:53.625
Hey.

57
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.208
What do you mean, "keroncong"?

58
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:58.500
We're not a keroncong band.

59
00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:00.541
We're singing Jeru's song.

60
00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:03.916
Hey! Come on, sing!

61
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.708
-Come on!
-How? Jeru isn't even here.

62
00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:09.708
-Hey, dude!
-Why aren't they singing?

63
00:06:11.208 --> 00:06:13.125
-Get off the stage!
-Yes.

64
00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:15.791
-Settle down!
-Allow me.

65
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.250
Do not let my…

66
00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:25.958
Hey! I don't speak English! Asshole!

67
00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:28.333
Hey. Please stay calm!

68
00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:29.875
Oh God!

69
00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.375
Get off the stage!

70
00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.875
Stay calm!

71
00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:52.000
Stay calm!

72
00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:53.208
Took you long enough.

73
00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:56.375
Another minute and this place
would have been Konco Seneng's grave.

74
00:06:56.458 --> 00:07:00.208
-Konco Seneng is ready to rock you all!
-All good.

75
00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:07.000
Konco Seneng!

76
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.500
Yes!

77
00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:37.875
Sing it!

78
00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:53.750
Come on, sing it!

79
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.791
I love you!

80
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.750
You can feel the difference, Yu.

81
00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:35.000
A big stage gives you
that special feeling, right?

82
00:09:35.083 --> 00:09:38.125
-Yeah. Our hard work paid off!
-Right!

83
00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:40.291
I got tired by the third song, though.

84
00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:42.916
Wahyu, we only did one song! What third?

85
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.666
-Really?
-You need to get your head checked.

86
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.291
Hey, Ru, Ndarboy called me

87
00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:50.500
and offered us a gig at a café.

88
00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:53.166
It's a good deal.
After performing, we can eat.

89
00:09:56.833 --> 00:09:59.583
Can you not bring up Ndarboy
in front of me?

90
00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:02.458
You were so cool!

91
00:10:02.541 --> 00:10:03.875
So cool!

92
00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:08.000
Are you tired?

93
00:10:08.083 --> 00:10:09.541
Thank you for supporting us.

94
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:13.916
What is it, Rick?
You wanna be like Jeru and Bethari?

95
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.333
No, he can't.

96
00:10:15.416 --> 00:10:16.500
Why not?

97
00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:17.875
He stays by her side but…

98
00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.125
Can't make her his.

99
00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:23.708
Just kidding.

100
00:10:27.458 --> 00:10:28.500
Hey, Thar…

101
00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:30.583
-Next week--
-Bethari.

102
00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:31.791
Yes?

103
00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:33.833
Did you get us featured in Solo News?

104
00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:36.166
That's right.

105
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:41.208
You're awesome! Not only did you get us
a gig, but you promoted us too.

106
00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:44.250
Guys! Say thank you.

107
00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:47.750
-Thank you, Your Highness!
-Thank you, Your Highness!

108
00:10:47.833 --> 00:10:49.416
Together, one, two, three.

109
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.916
Thank you, Your Highness!

110
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.333
My pleasure.

111
00:10:54.416 --> 00:10:55.708
The pleasure is ours.

112
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.458
-Hello, Irlas.
-Hi.

113
00:10:58.541 --> 00:10:59.541
Aruna!

114
00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.708
Irlas! How are you?

115
00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:03.750
I'm great.

116
00:11:03.833 --> 00:11:07.625
I just watched your performance.
Your band was great.

117
00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:09.041
-You did?
-Totally awesome.

118
00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:10.458
-Thank you. Alhamdulillah.
-You're welcome.

119
00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:13.958
I have an event next week.

120
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:16.500
I'd like Konco Seneng to perform there.

121
00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:17.791
Yes.

122
00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:18.958
Well?

123
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.166
-Sure, of course.
-Yeah?

124
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.750
You normally don't get paid
for gigs, right?

125
00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:25.541
-Just boxed meals?
-Yeah.

126
00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:27.833
At my event, we'll pay you for performing.

127
00:11:27.916 --> 00:11:30.250
-We'll get paid?
-Get paid?

128
00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:31.541
We'll get paid?

129
00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:35.125
But I can't pay off my debt, Nov.

130
00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.041
Why, you! But whatever.

131
00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:40.166
Irlas, if I get paid, can I at least

132
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.166
take my wife out for steak?

133
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.291
Sure, you can.

134
00:11:44.375 --> 00:11:47.250
She doesn't get steak often.

135
00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:48.291
This?

136
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.916
Is my wife a termite?

137
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.166
Your wife can eat this much, right?

138
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.250
If she could, she'd be a debus performer.

139
00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:55.041
I could.

140
00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:59.458
Well, I'll contact you later
for the details.

141
00:11:59.541 --> 00:12:00.541
-Okay.
-Okay, nice.

142
00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:03.500
-Thank you so much.
-I'll see you later.

143
00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:05.291
-Take care!
-Yeah, see you.

144
00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:08.250
Wow… getting paid to perform?

145
00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:10.958
Yes, Your Highness.

146
00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:12.541
I'll feature it in Solo News.

147
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.833
Okay.

148
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:22.875
Your Majesty.

149
00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:29.291
Her Highness Bethari
is nowhere to be seen.

150
00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.708
Did she finish the Ngapem ceremony?

151
00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:36.125
Yes. Bethari stayed until the end.

152
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:39.958
My apologies, Your Highness.

153
00:12:41.916 --> 00:12:45.041
Your friend has arrived.

154
00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:46.416
Okay.

155
00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:50.500
Well, I'll see you later, Your Majesty.

156
00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:52.208
Right.

157
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.666
Please, Your Highness.

158
00:12:57.375 --> 00:12:59.333
Where is your little sister?
Tell her to come home.

159
00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:03.083
Yes, Mother.

160
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.291
Mahen!

161
00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:11.541
Argo, Your Highness.

162
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:13.041
You don't have to be so formal.

163
00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:14.958
But we're in the Keraton palace.

164
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:16.666
Excuse me, Your Highness.

165
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.500
Right.

166
00:13:18.583 --> 00:13:19.583
How are you?

167
00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:21.041
Why did you call me?

168
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.791
It's nothing. Are you well?

169
00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:26.000
Hello?

170
00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:28.541
Oh, Irlas.

171
00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.291
What's the matter?

172
00:13:32.583 --> 00:13:34.958
His Highness Argo is with a guest.

173
00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:38.166
Pardon?

174
00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:41.500
Her Highness Bethari?

175
00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:46.416
I need money…

176
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.666
Go, go.

177
00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:05.500
Hello, you two angels.

178
00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:06.958
-Hello.
-How are you?

179
00:14:07.041 --> 00:14:09.541
-I'm okay.
-How was the gig, Aruna?

180
00:14:09.625 --> 00:14:10.791
It went well.

181
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.416
-Jeru, listen. About Ndaru…
-Rick.

182
00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:22.666
He got famous using my song.
Konco Seneng's song.

183
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.916
Ndaru came up with the idea for the song.

184
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.333
We just helped with the arrangement.

185
00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.833
But why did he claim it as his?

186
00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:39.875
I've tried to get you to talk to Ndaru,

187
00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.666
but you got upset.

188
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.708
Nov. Looks like the drama's starting.

189
00:14:45.416 --> 00:14:46.625
How about a coffee break?

190
00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:47.791
How rude!

191
00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:50.083
All you think about is coffee.

192
00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:52.958
Rick and Jeru are talking about
our band's arrangement,

193
00:14:53.041 --> 00:14:54.166
Konco Seneng's.

194
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.666
But I guess it's worth considering.

195
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.708
How about a coffee break? Wahyu is right.

196
00:14:58.416 --> 00:14:59.500
Rick?

197
00:14:59.583 --> 00:15:00.583
Go on in and make some.

198
00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.250
-Sure.
-Nice.

199
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:06.416
-Yu, what are you doing?
-Boiling some water, sir.

200
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.416
You're making your own drinks? Okay.

201
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.958
Excuse me, sir. I'll go help Wahyu.

202
00:15:11.041 --> 00:15:12.583
-Excuse me.
-Right.

203
00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:16.500
Be on time next time, Ru.

204
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.375
-Nov. You're the witness.
-Huh?

205
00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:22.500
I'm witnessing.

206
00:15:22.583 --> 00:15:25.250
They're paying us, so we must be on time.

207
00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:27.541
Be professional, no bad attitude.

208
00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:28.375
Right?

209
00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:32.291
I promise.

210
00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:33.791
I won't be late next time.

211
00:15:34.541 --> 00:15:36.666
I'll focus more on Konco Seneng.

212
00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.833
For Irlas' event, let's play keroncong

213
00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:42.500
with a touch of reggae.

214
00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:43.666
Your favorite, Rick.

215
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:44.916
-Nov.
-Yes?

216
00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:48.375
Take note of that.

217
00:15:49.458 --> 00:15:51.250
I think…

218
00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:52.625
it sounds great.

219
00:15:52.708 --> 00:15:54.208
With a touch of…

220
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:55.208
koplo music like before.

221
00:15:57.833 --> 00:15:58.833
Right?

222
00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:00.291
Who said it was koplo?

223
00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:02.375
It's keroncong reggae, not koplo.

224
00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:04.166
Yes. Reggae.

225
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.708
Bob Marley.

226
00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:09.000
The Ngapem ceremony went overtime,

227
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:12.500
so Bethari couldn't leave.

228
00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:14.291
Witnessing again, Bethari couldn't leave.

229
00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:15.916
Couldn't leave.

230
00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:19.083
Do you plan to stay in your relationship
with Bethari?

231
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.625
What do you think, Nov?

232
00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:25.791
If you want my opinion…

233
00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:27.583
You know deep down, right?

234
00:16:27.666 --> 00:16:30.250
Your relationship won't go as planned.

235
00:16:31.416 --> 00:16:32.875
So why keep it going?

236
00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:37.458
Right, Nov?

237
00:16:37.541 --> 00:16:39.041
Right.

238
00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.875
I feel you're not being professional, Ru.

239
00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:45.083
Nov.

240
00:16:45.583 --> 00:16:46.750
Hey.

241
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:49.750
Uh…

242
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.625
The water's not ready yet.

243
00:16:53.791 --> 00:16:56.458
Sit down for now, Yu.

244
00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.625
I'll take care of the water.

245
00:16:59.416 --> 00:17:00.458
Robusta!

246
00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:03.416
I'll make the coffee
with the Robusta blend!

247
00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:06.375
Yes, but…

248
00:17:09.083 --> 00:17:10.083
Don't you think so, Yu?

249
00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:11.291
Huh?

250
00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:12.666
What?

251
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.791
Jeru's been late a lot lately, right?

252
00:17:15.833 --> 00:17:17.666
Yeah, right. He's been late.

253
00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:19.791
Novian, you bastard.

254
00:17:19.875 --> 00:17:21.000
Okay.

255
00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:23.875
We've been growing Konco Seneng
since high school.

256
00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.833
Our dreams are one, right?

257
00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:30.208
What matters now is focusing
on Konco Seneng,

258
00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:33.291
so we can be more successful than Ndaru.

259
00:17:35.208 --> 00:17:36.208
Take note of that, Yu.

260
00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:41.458
I wish I wasn't here.

261
00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:46.125
Nov, where is it?

262
00:17:46.708 --> 00:17:48.291
Where's the coffee?

263
00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:50.583
Where? Did you make it?

264
00:17:51.416 --> 00:17:54.083
What? What do you mean by this?

265
00:17:54.166 --> 00:17:55.875
Here comes the tea.

266
00:17:57.125 --> 00:17:58.958
This is what you wanted, right?

267
00:18:01.666 --> 00:18:03.958
Why is everyone so quiet?

268
00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.541
Were you talking behind my back?

269
00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:07.166
-Yes.
-No.

270
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.541
-No.
-Yes.

271
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.083
Aunty Yeni.

272
00:18:18.208 --> 00:18:21.041
Anyways. Novian, take her home.

273
00:18:21.125 --> 00:18:23.625
Yes, boss! Ready, ready, ready.

274
00:18:23.708 --> 00:18:25.250
All right, Nov.

275
00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:28.833
Your Highness, I'd appreciate it
if you could help.

276
00:18:28.916 --> 00:18:30.750
I'll keep you posted.

277
00:18:30.833 --> 00:18:32.083
Thank you.

278
00:18:32.166 --> 00:18:33.583
You're welcome.

279
00:18:36.833 --> 00:18:38.208
We're here.

280
00:18:38.291 --> 00:18:40.583
Must be nice to have a house
like a palace.

281
00:18:40.666 --> 00:18:42.291
It is a palace.

282
00:18:42.375 --> 00:18:43.333
Here.

283
00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:48.166
What? No, I'm good.

284
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.916
Good evening, Your Highness.

285
00:18:53.708 --> 00:18:56.958
Miss, 50.000 isn't enough.

286
00:18:57.041 --> 00:18:59.916
We didn't stick to the route on the map

287
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.666
and ended up using more fuel.

288
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.625
Which means, this amount won't cut it.

289
00:19:05.708 --> 00:19:06.541
So, well…

290
00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:08.416
The red bill. Nice!

291
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.291
Thank you, Your Highness. Excuse me.

292
00:19:16.208 --> 00:19:18.500
Goodness… Your Highness?

293
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.166
Uncle Mahen?

294
00:19:21.166 --> 00:19:22.583
You've grown up.

295
00:19:23.208 --> 00:19:24.416
You're studying in Jakarta, right?

296
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.541
I graduated, Uncle.

297
00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:28.833
Are you still in the music industry?

298
00:19:28.916 --> 00:19:31.166
That's how I make money.

299
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.583
Why? Do you want to be a star?

300
00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:40.708
Well then, I'll see you around.

301
00:19:52.375 --> 00:19:54.000
Where have you been, Bethari?

302
00:19:56.583 --> 00:20:00.416
After the Ngapem ceremony,
I went to a friend's place.

303
00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:04.666
You've lived in Jakarta from when you were
in elementary school through to college.

304
00:20:05.666 --> 00:20:07.625
You have friends in Solo?

305
00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:08.875
A lot of them.

306
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:12.000
I'm going inside, Your Highness.

307
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.291
Pardon me, Your Highness.

308
00:20:38.541 --> 00:20:41.666
Jeru is back.
Thanks for keeping me company.

309
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.666
-See you, ma'am.
-Take care.

310
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.708
Sure.

311
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.250
-Hello, Dafa.
-Hello, Jeru.

312
00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:49.625
Take care, Lis.

313
00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:51.166
Assalamu alaikum.

314
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.041
Waalaikumsalam.

315
00:20:55.708 --> 00:20:57.791
Shall we go home now, princess?

316
00:20:57.875 --> 00:21:00.291
I thought your show ended
in the afternoon.

317
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.500
Aw, did you miss your handsome son?

318
00:21:05.541 --> 00:21:08.791
I was just hanging out at the base, Mom.

319
00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:12.250
With the group or with Her Highness?

320
00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:13.833
I heard about it.

321
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.625
After graduating last year,

322
00:21:17.708 --> 00:21:19.250
Her Highness Bethari came back to Solo.

323
00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:20.125
Right?

324
00:21:21.083 --> 00:21:22.125
Is that so, Mom?

325
00:21:22.208 --> 00:21:25.208
Reigniting old flames, eh?

326
00:21:25.291 --> 00:21:28.041
Oh please, Mom.

327
00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:30.250
Old flames? Extinguish them!

328
00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:34.166
So someone's going out of their way
to bring the fire back?

329
00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:38.125
Hey.

330
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:39.958
Back in the day,

331
00:21:41.208 --> 00:21:43.791
when your late father
worked at the Keraton palace,

332
00:21:44.875 --> 00:21:46.541
he often took you with him

333
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.500
to meet Her Highness Bethari.

334
00:21:50.666 --> 00:21:52.416
Both of you had a love of music

335
00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:54.625
and would sing together.

336
00:21:55.916 --> 00:21:58.083
That was in middle school, Mom.

337
00:22:00.083 --> 00:22:02.958
If there was any love,
it was probably just monkey love.

338
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.875
That was in the past.

339
00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.875
But if you two meet now,

340
00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:11.250
will it become a gorilla love?

341
00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:13.250
-Gorilla versus King Kong.
-Right.

342
00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.291
King Kong is huge, you know.

343
00:22:16.916 --> 00:22:18.000
Okay.

344
00:22:18.083 --> 00:22:19.916
Let's go. Wait, let me take this.

345
00:22:29.458 --> 00:22:30.500
Ru.

346
00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:32.541
Just keep in mind,

347
00:22:33.416 --> 00:22:36.625
Her Highness Bethari is of royal blood,

348
00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:40.791
while your dad was just a sweeper.

349
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:45.416
Don't worry, Mom.
Bethari and I aren't together.

350
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.541
Really?

351
00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:48.208
Don't be jealous, Mom.

352
00:22:48.291 --> 00:22:50.958
You're the only one in my heart, Mom.

353
00:22:52.416 --> 00:22:53.958
Okay. Let's go home.

354
00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:56.958
Let's go. I'm beat. And sleepy.

355
00:22:57.041 --> 00:23:00.333
Me too. You came too late.

356
00:23:00.875 --> 00:23:03.000
I'm ready. Let's go.

357
00:23:05.958 --> 00:23:09.750
KERATON BATIK SHOP

358
00:24:01.666 --> 00:24:03.083
Wait, pause.

359
00:24:04.458 --> 00:24:07.166
It's a bit off. How about making it koplo?

360
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.750
To make the audience feel more alive.

361
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.291
Like that.

362
00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:21.333
Jeru's agreed that we'll play keroncong
and reggae at Irlas' event

363
00:24:21.416 --> 00:24:23.000
instead of koplo.

364
00:24:23.083 --> 00:24:25.750
Hold it, Rick. Your sense of music
needs tuning.

365
00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:32.041
Koplo makes the audience and the vibe
more alive and hyped.

366
00:24:34.666 --> 00:24:36.083
Right, Yu? Koplo?

367
00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:37.166
Yeah. Let's do koplo, Rick.

368
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:38.916
Is Jeru the leader of this band?

369
00:24:39.541 --> 00:24:40.416
Huh?

370
00:24:44.833 --> 00:24:46.291
-Let's do reggae, Nov.
-Yeah.

371
00:24:48.666 --> 00:24:49.708
Hello, sir.

372
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.583
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

373
00:24:51.666 --> 00:24:53.250
Going wayang puppeteering?

374
00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:54.333
No.

375
00:24:54.416 --> 00:24:55.416
Going rock climbing.

376
00:24:58.666 --> 00:24:59.458
Rock climbing?

377
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:01.416
Sir, let me help you with that.

378
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.458
-Let's help him.
-Thank you.

379
00:25:03.541 --> 00:25:05.208
-Let's go.
-I'll put this here.

380
00:25:06.041 --> 00:25:07.541
We'll help him with his rock climbing.

381
00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:11.291
Rock climbing…

382
00:25:20.125 --> 00:25:24.583
Wahyu, all I can do is wayang.

383
00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:29.041
You, on the other hand,
are balancing your band and work.

384
00:25:29.125 --> 00:25:31.916
Yeah, but I'm only an office boy, sir.

385
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.666
That's still a job. You're fine.

386
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:38.625
Don't be like me,
wasting away with wayang and music.

387
00:25:38.708 --> 00:25:40.000
I'm a nobody.

388
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.875
All I'm saying is,

389
00:25:44.416 --> 00:25:45.875
that boy is smart, right?

390
00:25:45.958 --> 00:25:46.958
Yes, sir.

391
00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:48.458
He's a clever boy.

392
00:25:48.541 --> 00:25:52.625
He could apply to be a civil servant
and get accepted for sure.

393
00:25:52.708 --> 00:25:57.166
But what happens to those who choose
music? They become nobodies.

394
00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.166
Do you want to keep living like that?

395
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.583
Come on, let's finish this, guys.

396
00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:02.916
Wait, sir.

397
00:26:03.583 --> 00:26:04.958
Dam, what are you doing?

398
00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:06.375
You've only been giving orders.

399
00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:08.250
You're just standing there.

400
00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:10.083
-What are you doing?
-Answer him.

401
00:26:12.125 --> 00:26:13.541
I don't understand Javanese.

402
00:26:14.625 --> 00:26:17.125
Don't yell at him. He's not even Javanese.

403
00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:18.958
-Let's go.
-He looks Diengnese.

404
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:20.041
Sorry, sir.

405
00:26:20.125 --> 00:26:21.750
-Okay.
-Let's get going.

406
00:26:21.833 --> 00:26:23.166
Yes, sir.

407
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.625
All done.

408
00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:28.125
Yu.

409
00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:29.750
What?

410
00:26:29.833 --> 00:26:32.500
Was he talking about us or Rick?

411
00:26:33.666 --> 00:26:35.500
He can't be talking about us.

412
00:26:38.125 --> 00:26:39.625
But it kinda feels like he was.

413
00:26:42.583 --> 00:26:44.041
We're committed to music.

414
00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:49.250
I hope he's safe.

415
00:26:53.583 --> 00:26:57.083
All parents want
the best for their kids, Rick.

416
00:27:00.416 --> 00:27:02.541
What are you saying?

417
00:27:02.625 --> 00:27:06.333
Your dad allowed Konco Seneng
to rehearse here

418
00:27:06.416 --> 00:27:08.000
and set up a base here.

419
00:27:08.083 --> 00:27:12.791
That means that deep down,
he wishes for you to succeed in music.

420
00:27:12.875 --> 00:27:15.916
If he truly wants the best for me,
if he supports me,

421
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.791
he should show it,

422
00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:19.125
not set a deadline.

423
00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:22.208
"If you don't succeed in music
after a year,

424
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:23.583
quit doing music!"

425
00:27:23.666 --> 00:27:26.250
"Apply for a position in the civil service
or some other government job!"

426
00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:30.458
I might as well apply for the FBI,
the CIA, or even Mossad!

427
00:27:31.708 --> 00:27:33.166
I hope he'll do well.

428
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.958
Yeah, he brought everything.

429
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:38.500
-Aruna, Rick, were you chatting?
-Keep going.

430
00:27:38.583 --> 00:27:41.375
Stuck in the talking stage,
never getting together.

431
00:27:41.875 --> 00:27:44.333
It's basically this, Yu.

432
00:27:44.416 --> 00:27:46.000
Never had it,

433
00:27:46.083 --> 00:27:48.875
but had to let go.

434
00:27:57.625 --> 00:27:58.708
Where are you, Ru?

435
00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:05.916
You call this your leader?

436
00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:08.083
All he does is arrive late

437
00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:09.208
or not show up at all.

438
00:28:10.083 --> 00:28:12.083
Rick! Our rehearsal!

439
00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:14.291
Do it yourselves!

440
00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:22.666
YOU'RE HAPPY, I'M HAPPY
EVERYONE'S HAPPY

441
00:28:24.083 --> 00:28:25.708
Are you going to play in your band?

442
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:28.250
No, Ndar. Why would I?

443
00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:30.583
Are you playing in a band?

444
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.791
Don't say that, okay?

445
00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:35.958
-Okay.
-High five.

446
00:28:36.416 --> 00:28:40.166
-Nice!
-All good. She won't snitch.

447
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.250
Mom! Dad is going to play in a band!

448
00:28:42.333 --> 00:28:43.333
Blabbermouth!

449
00:28:43.416 --> 00:28:45.291
-What was that?
-Um, Ndar…

450
00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:47.000
What do you mean?

451
00:28:47.083 --> 00:28:48.875
-Catfish.
-Ukulele…

452
00:28:49.583 --> 00:28:50.958
Ouch! It's catfish.

453
00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:52.291
I threw away the rotten catfish.

454
00:28:52.375 --> 00:28:54.958
-Who would eat rotten catfish?
-Right.

455
00:28:55.041 --> 00:28:56.500
Where are you going?

456
00:28:57.291 --> 00:28:58.958
To attend a funeral.

457
00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:00.458
-A friend's--
-A friend's dad is…

458
00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:01.875
-Dead?
-Yes, died.

459
00:29:01.958 --> 00:29:03.875
-Whose dad?
-Slamet's dad.

460
00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:05.208
It's getting far…

461
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:06.750
His house is far.

462
00:29:06.833 --> 00:29:09.208
-Getting far from the world.
-The world.

463
00:29:09.291 --> 00:29:10.833
-His soul.
-Right.

464
00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:13.083
-And…
-Down the alley…

465
00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:14.333
His house is down in the alley.

466
00:29:14.416 --> 00:29:16.833
His house is in an alley,
and he choked on a ukulele.

467
00:29:17.708 --> 00:29:19.250
-Choked on a catfish.
-Yeah, catfish.

468
00:29:19.333 --> 00:29:21.250
-Liar!
-He died of choking.

469
00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:23.125
I'm going now, dear.
I'll bring back three boxed meals.

470
00:29:23.208 --> 00:29:24.083
No, five!

471
00:29:24.166 --> 00:29:26.416
Huh? Five?

472
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.708
-You'll get three, right?
-Yeah.

473
00:29:27.791 --> 00:29:29.083
-And he'll get three?
-Yeah.

474
00:29:29.166 --> 00:29:30.875
Ask for two of his. That's five.

475
00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:34.041
Bring back five or else!

476
00:29:34.125 --> 00:29:35.708
If you don't bring five,

477
00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:36.958
you can sleep outside.

478
00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:38.458
I refuse to sleep next to you!

479
00:29:39.125 --> 00:29:41.750
Then who will sleep next to you, Ndar?

480
00:29:43.333 --> 00:29:44.208
I can.

481
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:46.750
What do you mean? Huh?

482
00:29:46.833 --> 00:29:49.083
-Hey, let's go, Nov.
-What's happened?

483
00:29:49.166 --> 00:29:52.208
-It's going far away. It really is!
-What do you mean?

484
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:54.166
-Come on!
-Hop on.

485
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.000
Let's go, Nov. Or else we won't catch up.

486
00:29:57.083 --> 00:29:58.541
-Assalamu alaikum.
-Waalaikumsalam.

487
00:29:59.041 --> 00:30:00.416
I hope you're not lying.

488
00:30:00.958 --> 00:30:02.250
Mom, can someone die

489
00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:04.000
from choking on a catfish?

490
00:30:04.833 --> 00:30:06.666
Yes, if your dad doesn't come home
with five boxed meals.

491
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:07.875
Come inside.

492
00:30:11.458 --> 00:30:12.416
Hey…

493
00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:17.291
Thari, why not accept Uncle Mahen's offer?

494
00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:20.375
You have a great voice.

495
00:30:20.958 --> 00:30:22.000
I'm good.

496
00:30:22.083 --> 00:30:23.750
I want you to be a star, Ru.

497
00:30:26.541 --> 00:30:29.875
Nov, your ukulele smells like trash.

498
00:30:31.125 --> 00:30:33.666
-It smells.
-But we're getting paid. Let's go.

499
00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:38.041
-Hello, guys!
-Hello!

500
00:30:39.125 --> 00:30:40.708
You all good?

501
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.250
What's that smell?

502
00:30:48.416 --> 00:30:50.000
Yeah, something smells.

503
00:30:54.875 --> 00:30:56.916
Guys, let's get ready.

504
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.416
That band's finishing soon.
After that, it's our turn.

505
00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:03.708
Remember, go all out. Better than ever.

506
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:07.750
Today is the first time
Konco Seneng is getting paid for a gig.

507
00:31:09.166 --> 00:31:10.333
Yay!

508
00:31:10.416 --> 00:31:12.458
-We're getting paid!
-Yes!

509
00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:16.333
What's that smell?

510
00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:20.833
What smell?

511
00:31:20.916 --> 00:31:21.625
"What smell"?

512
00:31:27.083 --> 00:31:28.166
Yeah.

513
00:31:29.041 --> 00:31:30.541
I wonder.

514
00:31:31.791 --> 00:31:35.041
Enough about that. Time to go all out!

515
00:31:35.125 --> 00:31:38.583
-Come on!
-Let's go! Get ready.

516
00:31:38.666 --> 00:31:41.583
-We get paid!
-We get paid!

517
00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:44.333
Come on. Let's do a group cheer.

518
00:31:44.416 --> 00:31:47.583
Guys, let's do a group cheer.

519
00:31:47.666 --> 00:31:52.458
Because tonight, we get paid, paid, paid!

520
00:31:52.541 --> 00:31:57.875
Konco Seneng… You're happy,
I'm happy, everyone's happy!

521
00:31:57.958 --> 00:31:59.416
Go all out!

522
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.666
Aruna. Wait a minute.

523
00:32:04.125 --> 00:32:05.666
Konco Seneng's performance is canceled.

524
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.250
Huh?

525
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.375
What do you mean, Irlas?

526
00:32:09.458 --> 00:32:10.916
What are you saying?

527
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.375
You won't be performing.

528
00:32:12.458 --> 00:32:14.041
Asshole! I'll show you!

529
00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:16.458
-Wait, Rick!
-Calm down.

530
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:19.083
Easy there. This wasn't my decision.

531
00:32:19.166 --> 00:32:20.583
It was the sponsor's.

532
00:32:20.666 --> 00:32:23.250
They don't want Konco Seneng
performing at my event.

533
00:32:24.333 --> 00:32:26.125
That's all, guys. I'm sorry.

534
00:32:26.208 --> 00:32:28.583
I hope we can work together again.

535
00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:38.041
-What?
-It means we're not performing.

536
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:43.625
-Is that hard to understand?
-Bernadi.

537
00:32:43.708 --> 00:32:45.541
Sir! Mr. Bernadi!

538
00:32:45.625 --> 00:32:47.666
Thar! Thari! Where are you going?

539
00:32:51.166 --> 00:32:52.250
Bernadi!

540
00:33:03.041 --> 00:33:05.250
About our performance being canceled…

541
00:33:06.583 --> 00:33:08.833
Bethari and I…

542
00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:12.000
are sorry.

543
00:33:13.208 --> 00:33:18.583
It wasn't Irlas or the sponsor
who canceled it.

544
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.833
It was

545
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.208
Uncle Argo.

546
00:33:25.916 --> 00:33:27.250
Bethari's uncle.

547
00:33:31.125 --> 00:33:33.000
Why would your uncle do that?

548
00:33:37.583 --> 00:33:38.583
Oh, I know.

549
00:33:38.666 --> 00:33:41.041
Because he's against you dating Jeru!

550
00:33:41.125 --> 00:33:45.375
Rick, let's solve this problem.
Don't just walk away.

551
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:47.583
How?

552
00:33:47.666 --> 00:33:49.250
I told you before,

553
00:33:49.333 --> 00:33:50.833
don't date Bethari!

554
00:33:50.916 --> 00:33:52.375
It's a forbidden relationship!

555
00:33:53.375 --> 00:33:54.666
Rick!

556
00:33:57.791 --> 00:33:59.916
We should find a solution together.

557
00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:04.833
What are you hoping to get
from dating Bethari?

558
00:34:06.833 --> 00:34:08.041
You'll get nothing, Ru.

559
00:34:08.833 --> 00:34:10.541
Your mom doesn't approve,

560
00:34:11.291 --> 00:34:13.083
and Bethari's family approves even less!

561
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:16.666
But Rick, let's not forget,

562
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.583
Bethari's done a lot for our band.

563
00:34:19.833 --> 00:34:24.208
Getting us gigs,
promoting us in Solo News.

564
00:34:24.291 --> 00:34:26.291
That's helped our band a lot, Rick.

565
00:34:28.208 --> 00:34:30.708
Okay, Bethari helps us with gigs.

566
00:34:31.458 --> 00:34:34.583
She does that so you get to slack off!

567
00:34:36.208 --> 00:34:39.625
You're always late! How many times
have you shown up late for gigs?

568
00:34:39.708 --> 00:34:41.416
You always do koplo!

569
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.333
You never want to do keroncong!

570
00:34:43.416 --> 00:34:45.041
We were about to perform keroncong, Rick.

571
00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:47.208
It was canceled! We didn't perform!

572
00:34:50.416 --> 00:34:51.458
Rick.

573
00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.541
Rick.

574
00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:10.166
I do want to be a huge celebrity. A star.

575
00:35:14.208 --> 00:35:18.291
But what I want even more is

576
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
to see you become a star.

577
00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:28.375
Once you're successful…

578
00:35:30.166 --> 00:35:31.625
and famous…

579
00:35:34.875 --> 00:35:36.833
no one will care about

580
00:35:38.875 --> 00:35:40.416
our differences.

581
00:35:51.041 --> 00:35:52.208
Do you think…

582
00:35:55.208 --> 00:35:56.458
Do you think Rick is right?

583
00:35:58.083 --> 00:35:59.625
What do you mean?

584
00:35:59.708 --> 00:36:01.791
Should we break up, Ru?

585
00:36:02.625 --> 00:36:04.916
No, Thari. No.

586
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.666
We knew what we were getting into

587
00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:09.750
when we started dating, didn't we?

588
00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:20.500
Pardon me, Your Highness.

589
00:36:26.916 --> 00:36:31.083
This is unfair.
Konco Seneng isn't just Jeru.

590
00:36:31.916 --> 00:36:33.416
Still, Jeru is there, right?

591
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.916
Jeru is only one part of it,
Your Highness.

592
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.708
You didn't just hurt one person,

593
00:36:39.791 --> 00:36:41.416
you hurt a lot of people.

594
00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:43.875
With all due respect, Your Highness,

595
00:36:44.958 --> 00:36:46.666
I don't care.

596
00:36:47.875 --> 00:36:51.083
I have been entrusted by His Majesty
to manage the Keraton palace.

597
00:36:52.208 --> 00:36:56.000
Anyone who brings shame to the palace
will face the consequences.

598
00:36:58.791 --> 00:37:00.458
Royal blood to royal blood.

599
00:37:01.375 --> 00:37:03.166
That's such outdated thinking,
Your Highness.

600
00:37:03.958 --> 00:37:05.291
It's no longer relevant.

601
00:37:07.458 --> 00:37:08.541
So?

602
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
You, as the daughter of His Majesty,

603
00:37:11.083 --> 00:37:14.500
want to marry the son
of the lowliest servant?

604
00:37:22.541 --> 00:37:23.625
Your Highness.

605
00:37:24.458 --> 00:37:27.916
From now on,
you shall not leave the palace

606
00:37:28.458 --> 00:37:31.625
unless there's a valid reason.

607
00:39:32.666 --> 00:39:34.083
Mother.

608
00:39:37.791 --> 00:39:42.458
You should listen to His Highness Argo.

609
00:39:43.708 --> 00:39:48.333
His Majesty trusts
His Highness Argo more than me.

610
00:40:15.166 --> 00:40:17.000
Hang in there, sweetie.

611
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:35.625
Okay.

612
00:40:37.333 --> 00:40:39.375
Please don't let it bother you.

613
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.166
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Assalamu alaikum.

614
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.916
Let me help.

615
00:40:49.791 --> 00:40:53.541
Mom, the parang and kawung motifs
aren't available yet.

616
00:40:54.208 --> 00:40:56.083
-Ru.
-Yes, Mom?

617
00:41:13.125 --> 00:41:14.458
Why did you lie to me?

618
00:41:16.666 --> 00:41:18.000
Lie about what?

619
00:41:21.083 --> 00:41:23.458
Are you seeing Her Highness Bethari?

620
00:41:27.875 --> 00:41:30.083
Do you know who she is?

621
00:41:32.625 --> 00:41:33.916
Do you know who you are?

622
00:41:38.416 --> 00:41:39.750
Talk to me, Ru.

623
00:41:41.083 --> 00:41:42.500
Don't lie to me.

624
00:41:47.833 --> 00:41:50.291
Times have changed, Mom.

625
00:41:51.916 --> 00:41:56.083
Royals can marry commoners, Mom.

626
00:41:58.125 --> 00:42:00.541
The royals

627
00:42:01.916 --> 00:42:04.416
who marry non-royals

628
00:42:05.833 --> 00:42:08.375
do so because
their social standing is equal.

629
00:42:10.583 --> 00:42:15.166
Your father, a mere palace sweeper,

630
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:19.583
will never be on the same level
as His Majesty.

631
00:42:21.958 --> 00:42:24.833
If you still consider me your mother…

632
00:42:28.125 --> 00:42:29.916
break up with Her Highness Bethari.

633
00:42:32.625 --> 00:42:34.750
Stay away from her.

634
00:43:13.083 --> 00:43:14.916
Who's your crush, Rick?

635
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.666
Who is it?

636
00:43:18.708 --> 00:43:20.916
What? No one.

637
00:43:22.041 --> 00:43:23.041
At least for now.

638
00:43:24.791 --> 00:43:26.625
That's my new song.

639
00:43:27.416 --> 00:43:28.250
It's nice.

640
00:43:33.166 --> 00:43:35.125
But a new song is pointless.

641
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:39.375
You know that Jeru and I
never agree on anything.

642
00:43:40.583 --> 00:43:41.750
Let it go.

643
00:43:41.833 --> 00:43:45.375
The fight happened yesterday.
Stop dragging it on.

644
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:50.041
Remember how long you've been friends.

645
00:43:50.125 --> 00:43:51.291
Since high school, right?

646
00:43:51.375 --> 00:43:55.000
Then came Novian, Wahyu,

647
00:43:55.083 --> 00:43:57.125
and the other bandmates.

648
00:43:57.583 --> 00:43:59.708
Then you met me.

649
00:43:59.791 --> 00:44:01.291
And now we're in Konco Seneng together.

650
00:44:01.375 --> 00:44:04.833
If you keep arguing,
when will you succeed?

651
00:44:07.125 --> 00:44:08.291
Besides,

652
00:44:08.375 --> 00:44:11.833
this is just your egos clashing, Rick.

653
00:44:22.791 --> 00:44:24.000
It's hot.

654
00:44:24.708 --> 00:44:25.708
It's hot.

655
00:44:25.791 --> 00:44:27.833
-You can keep it cool, right?
-It's scorching hot.

656
00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:32.333
I mean, keep your cool for Konco Seneng.

657
00:44:37.583 --> 00:44:39.791
-Fine.
-Really?

658
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:44.208
If you're calm, there's something
I want to say, Rick.

659
00:44:53.625 --> 00:44:55.500
I also need to tell you something, Na.

660
00:44:55.583 --> 00:44:57.041
Let's talk tomorrow.

661
00:44:57.125 --> 00:44:59.458
We'll both talk.

662
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:03.291
How did your song go, Rick?

663
00:45:07.125 --> 00:45:08.583
That's too high. What note was that?

664
00:45:08.666 --> 00:45:10.458
It's E. You like singing at E, right?

665
00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:11.708
Make it C.

666
00:46:13.416 --> 00:46:15.583
FLOWER SHOP

667
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.875
I wonder what Aruna will say today.

668
00:46:58.541 --> 00:47:00.250
I think she's going to confess to me.

669
00:47:02.625 --> 00:47:04.291
How does she usually speak?

670
00:47:12.041 --> 00:47:14.625
"Rick, I like you."

671
00:47:15.083 --> 00:47:17.875
Na, we've known each other for so long.

672
00:47:19.041 --> 00:47:22.208
To be honest,

673
00:47:22.708 --> 00:47:24.791
I've been secretly in love with you.

674
00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:26.833
I got you these flowers,

675
00:47:27.291 --> 00:47:29.375
and I want you to accept them.

676
00:48:50.125 --> 00:48:51.291
Why are you all dressed up?

677
00:48:51.875 --> 00:48:53.291
Usually, you give off bad-boy vibes.

678
00:48:53.791 --> 00:48:55.875
Wait here for a sec.

679
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:32.875
Aren't you gonna talk?

680
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:34.833
I'm about to.

681
00:49:37.416 --> 00:49:39.375
Did you have to dress up?

682
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.125
This is how I should talk to you, Rick.

683
00:49:44.083 --> 00:49:46.833
What do you think? Is my outfit okay?

684
00:49:46.916 --> 00:49:49.625
How's my hair? Do I look good in this?

685
00:49:51.083 --> 00:49:53.291
Do you think it suits me?

686
00:49:53.375 --> 00:49:54.708
You…

687
00:49:55.166 --> 00:49:56.291
look different.

688
00:49:56.916 --> 00:49:58.250
You

689
00:49:58.833 --> 00:49:59.583
look beautiful, Na.

690
00:49:59.666 --> 00:50:03.291
Alhamdulillah, now I feel confident.

691
00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:04.416
Okay, let's go!

692
00:50:04.916 --> 00:50:06.000
What about the talk?

693
00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:09.500
I just did.

694
00:50:09.583 --> 00:50:12.625
I wanted to ask for your opinion
about my outfit.

695
00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:15.000
I'm about to take the fit and proper test
to be a lecturer.

696
00:50:16.916 --> 00:50:18.916
Do you have to dress up
this nicely for it?

697
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.791
You see,

698
00:50:20.875 --> 00:50:25.708
the examiner is one of my high school's
most handsome seniors.

699
00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:30.291
He gives off this "Nathan Tjoe-A-On" vibe.

700
00:50:30.791 --> 00:50:32.125
The football player?

701
00:50:32.208 --> 00:50:33.166
No.

702
00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:34.583
The devil's drum player.

703
00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:36.625
Come on, let's go.

704
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:42.000
Oh, weren't you going to say
something too?

705
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:47.375
What do you think of my outfit?

706
00:50:48.041 --> 00:50:50.750
You… look cool.

707
00:50:51.291 --> 00:50:52.708
It's not like your usual style.

708
00:50:54.916 --> 00:50:55.958
Let me see.

709
00:50:58.791 --> 00:51:00.375
Are those flowers? For whom?

710
00:51:05.875 --> 00:51:08.166
-My dad asked me to buy some.
-Your dad?

711
00:51:09.458 --> 00:51:12.791
Your dad is popular even at his age.

712
00:51:13.333 --> 00:51:16.666
Meanwhile, his young son is always single.

713
00:51:17.583 --> 00:51:20.375
Let's get going, Rick!
I don't want to be late!

714
00:51:29.875 --> 00:51:31.083
Aruna.

715
00:51:31.166 --> 00:51:33.166
Tidar. How did I do?

716
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:34.416
You were great.

717
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:35.916
Seriously?

718
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.916
Let's hope the other examiners
agree with my evaluation.

719
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.250
Thank you so much.

720
00:51:42.041 --> 00:51:44.625
You should definitely become
a lecturer here,

721
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:47.791
even if it's just as a substitute.

722
00:51:47.875 --> 00:51:49.791
-Well, take care.
-Okay.

723
00:51:57.958 --> 00:51:59.166
Hey, Rick.

724
00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.916
Hey. You're done?

725
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.583
Alhamdulillah. I trust that

726
00:52:04.666 --> 00:52:07.083
Tidar can help me become a lecturer.

727
00:52:08.083 --> 00:52:09.750
Thank you, Tidar.

728
00:52:15.583 --> 00:52:16.375
Let's go.

729
00:52:17.041 --> 00:52:18.083
Let's go.

730
00:53:28.833 --> 00:53:31.291
Why is it a song about separation?

731
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:35.541
No, babe. We won't be separated.

732
00:53:37.583 --> 00:53:39.375
I'm so bored here.

733
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:41.875
I can't go out.

734
00:53:42.625 --> 00:53:44.000
I'm under surveillance.

735
00:53:44.083 --> 00:53:45.583
If I want to go out,

736
00:53:46.375 --> 00:53:48.291
I need a valid reason.

737
00:53:49.458 --> 00:53:51.083
But once you're a star,

738
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:53.916
it'll be a different story.

739
00:53:55.166 --> 00:53:59.666
Thari. Uncle Mahen offered you
the chance to be a star,

740
00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:02.166
but you declined, right?

741
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:06.250
Do you think Uncle Mahen
could help Konco Seneng?

742
00:54:07.375 --> 00:54:08.958
Be our producer,

743
00:54:09.041 --> 00:54:10.250
help us record an album,

744
00:54:10.333 --> 00:54:12.375
and help us make a music video.

745
00:54:12.458 --> 00:54:14.250
We'd be famous in no time.

746
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:18.875
But how do I get out to see Uncle Mahen?

747
00:54:25.208 --> 00:54:27.208
Since His Majesty's party is approaching,

748
00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:30.541
please gather all the servants
in the hallway.

749
00:54:30.625 --> 00:54:31.958
Yes, Your Highness.

750
00:54:32.041 --> 00:54:33.083
Ri!

751
00:54:39.333 --> 00:54:41.458
Where are you going?

752
00:54:41.541 --> 00:54:43.166
I hope you have a good reason for this.

753
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:46.416
If it's about Jeru,
you won't be going out.

754
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.291
But it's important, sister.

755
00:54:49.125 --> 00:54:51.250
Konco Seneng could make it big.

756
00:54:57.125 --> 00:54:58.750
Aunty. Aunty Yeni.

757
00:55:00.583 --> 00:55:03.083
Your Highness.

758
00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:04.458
Your command, Your Highness?

759
00:55:26.541 --> 00:55:27.583
Sir.

760
00:55:30.333 --> 00:55:31.458
Hello.

761
00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.458
There it is!

762
00:55:55.666 --> 00:55:59.750
-Uncle Mahen! I'm coming!
-Uncle Mahen! I'm coming!

763
00:56:21.166 --> 00:56:23.083
Why don't you be the singer instead?

764
00:56:23.833 --> 00:56:26.291
According to His Highness Argo,

765
00:56:27.375 --> 00:56:30.291
members of the royal family
are not meant to be celebrities.

766
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:36.166
But I believe Konco Seneng
will become popular!

767
00:56:38.083 --> 00:56:39.666
Okay. Listen.

768
00:56:40.791 --> 00:56:42.750
Make two new songs

769
00:56:42.833 --> 00:56:45.833
that haven't been released in any form,

770
00:56:45.916 --> 00:56:47.333
and then send them to me.

771
00:56:47.416 --> 00:56:50.375
If they're good, we can work together.

772
00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.041
-Yes, Uncle.
-Yes, Uncle.

773
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.416
No way! It's just another false hope.

774
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:07.458
Uncle Mahen reassured Bethari and me

775
00:57:07.541 --> 00:57:10.666
that if the song was good enough,
he'd help produce it.

776
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:13.750
Konco Seneng will rise to fame.

777
00:57:15.333 --> 00:57:17.166
It involves Bethari, doesn't it?

778
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:19.541
It'll be another scam like before!

779
00:57:19.625 --> 00:57:21.041
Rick.

780
00:57:21.125 --> 00:57:21.875
Rick!

781
00:57:23.375 --> 00:57:24.625
What are you saying?

782
00:57:24.708 --> 00:57:26.250
You're late to practice
because of Bethari!

783
00:57:26.708 --> 00:57:28.416
You're late for gigs because of her!

784
00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.500
Why was our show canceled?

785
00:57:30.583 --> 00:57:31.875
Because of her uncle, Ru!

786
00:57:32.625 --> 00:57:35.666
Now a new opportunity has come up,
but it will end the same.

787
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:36.791
It won't happen!

788
00:57:37.416 --> 00:57:38.791
Uncle Mahen okayed it.

789
00:57:38.875 --> 00:57:40.291
Who's going to hold us back?

790
00:57:40.375 --> 00:57:42.125
I don't know, anyone!

791
00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:43.083
Rick.

792
00:57:43.708 --> 00:57:46.916
Bethari and I have tried
to convince everyone.

793
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.291
Nothing can stop us, Rick.

794
00:57:50.375 --> 00:57:53.833
Konco Seneng will be
Uncle Mahen's pride and joy.

795
00:57:56.041 --> 00:57:57.166
Fine.

796
00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:00.500
Konco Seneng, each member
will submit a new song.

797
00:58:00.583 --> 00:58:02.250
Okay.

798
00:58:02.333 --> 00:58:04.333
We'll pick the best two

799
00:58:05.083 --> 00:58:07.041
and arrange them together as a team.

800
00:58:07.125 --> 00:58:08.583
Okay.

801
00:58:08.666 --> 00:58:12.458
One song will be koplo,
and the other one will be keroncong.

802
00:58:17.625 --> 00:58:18.458
Keroncong?

803
00:58:27.708 --> 00:58:29.708
-For real, Ru?
-I'm serious, Rick.

804
00:58:34.125 --> 00:58:35.958
Okay. I trust you.

805
00:58:36.458 --> 00:58:39.541
I hope this leads to our success.

806
00:58:49.791 --> 00:58:50.958
They're arm in arm

807
00:58:51.041 --> 00:58:52.208
just like Teletubbies.

808
00:58:52.791 --> 00:58:53.750
I can do it too.

809
00:58:53.833 --> 00:58:56.166
Don't get chummy.

810
00:58:56.250 --> 00:59:00.458
Since I'm not famous yet,
I can be all chummy.

811
00:59:00.541 --> 00:59:02.541
But if you become famous, so will I.

812
00:59:02.625 --> 00:59:03.458
How?

813
00:59:03.541 --> 00:59:05.041
We're in the same band.

814
00:59:05.125 --> 00:59:06.541
Right.

815
00:59:08.958 --> 00:59:12.041
Once you're famous,
get endorsements from Wak Penyok.

816
00:59:13.083 --> 00:59:14.291
Wak Brewok.

817
00:59:14.375 --> 00:59:18.750
That's enough. Remember to
send me your new songs.

818
00:59:18.833 --> 00:59:19.958
And don't forget

819
00:59:20.708 --> 00:59:23.541
to pitch in for the recording fund.

820
00:59:23.625 --> 00:59:24.750
Gotcha!

821
00:59:25.541 --> 00:59:28.083
Hey, your phone is buzzing.

822
00:59:28.166 --> 00:59:29.458
Your phone.

823
00:59:32.833 --> 00:59:34.583
-Who is it?
-It's Indar, my wife.

824
00:59:34.666 --> 00:59:35.958
Hang up!

825
00:59:36.041 --> 00:59:36.750
Hang up my wife?

826
00:59:36.833 --> 00:59:38.166
No! Hang up your phone!

827
00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:40.416
If I hang up on her, I'm as good as dead.

828
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:42.083
You want me to die?

829
00:59:42.166 --> 00:59:42.875
Yeah!

830
00:59:42.958 --> 00:59:44.916
If I die, who will take care of Indar?

831
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.583
-I can.
-Oh, you want this?

832
00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:49.333
No, no. Just answer it then.

833
00:59:49.958 --> 00:59:51.750
-Hello.
-Hey, over here.

834
00:59:51.833 --> 00:59:53.416
I panicked.

835
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.875
What a clown.

836
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:58.708
Hello, my darling angel.

837
00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:02.750
Hearing you say "darling" makes me
want to kick you. Where are you?

838
01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.583
I'm at the bike taxi base.

839
01:00:05.666 --> 01:00:06.958
Mister, honk, honk!

840
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:16.333
-You hear that?
-Stop lying!

841
01:00:16.416 --> 01:00:17.791
Video call me right now!

842
01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:24.375
I'm out of data…

843
01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:27.458
Liar! I just bought you some!

844
01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.583
-Video call me right now!
-Okay, okay.

845
01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:34.916
See?

846
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.291
Show me around.

847
01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:37.625
Look.

848
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:41.791
See?

849
01:00:42.916 --> 01:00:44.250
Make it quick!

850
01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:47.291
You don't trust your own husband?

851
01:00:48.791 --> 01:00:50.166
Keep honking.

852
01:00:51.583 --> 01:00:52.583
Look.

853
01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:56.666
You jerk!

854
01:00:57.166 --> 01:01:00.333
Why are you still in a band?
Can you even give me 2.5 million?

855
01:01:00.416 --> 01:01:02.250
What? 2.5 million?

856
01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:04.208
Bella, your daughter,

857
01:01:05.041 --> 01:01:07.666
needs 2.5 million
to enroll in kindergarten!

858
01:01:08.583 --> 01:01:12.708
Yes, dear. I'll come home
with 2.5 million.

859
01:01:12.791 --> 01:01:16.666
If you don't come back with 2.5 million,

860
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.708
you're sleeping outside for a month.

861
01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:29.666
What will you do?

862
01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:39.500
It's not like I'm begging.

863
01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:40.875
Of course not.

864
01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:47.333
Seventy.

865
01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:49.708
This is from Anang.

866
01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:51.833
And Rahmed.

867
01:01:55.583 --> 01:01:57.291
And the change from buying toothpaste.

868
01:01:58.416 --> 01:02:01.791
Even if you only have gums,
you're the best.

869
01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:07.000
Nov, I have to admit…

870
01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:08.416
What?

871
01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:10.791
The band may be temporary,

872
01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.250
but brotherhood lasts forever, Nov.

873
01:02:14.791 --> 01:02:16.583
God!

874
01:02:17.083 --> 01:02:19.416
This is for our brotherhood.

875
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.583
Look at this! A red bill!

876
01:02:21.666 --> 01:02:22.625
Yes, a red bill.

877
01:02:23.083 --> 01:02:24.291
But give me the change.

878
01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:28.208
Sure, we're brothers.
But there's gotta be something in return.

879
01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:29.875
I'll cover the rest.

880
01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:32.416
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

881
01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:37.166
But remember, you all must work hard

882
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.291
to raise money for the recording.

883
01:02:39.375 --> 01:02:41.375
I promise you. Now what?

884
01:02:42.166 --> 01:02:44.000
This bill is ripped. Can I get a new one?

885
01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:49.291
-Ru.
-Yes, Mom?

886
01:02:49.375 --> 01:02:50.458
Jeru.

887
01:02:51.291 --> 01:02:54.500
Are you using your entire paycheck
for the recording?

888
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.208
Wish me luck, Mom.

889
01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:59.500
I always wish for your success
every night, Ru.

890
01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:00.333
Thank you.

891
01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:02.208
-I'm off, Mom. Assalamu alaikum.
-Take care.

892
01:03:02.291 --> 01:03:03.125
Good luck.

893
01:03:03.208 --> 01:03:05.916
-Yeah. Assalamu alaikum.
-Waalaikumsalam.

894
01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.708
So heavy.

895
01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:12.416
Gosh.

896
01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:24.083
Working this late, Wahyu?

897
01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:25.416
Here, for you.

898
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.416
Sir, I'm sorry.

899
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:32.625
I can't accept something
that's not related to my work, sir.

900
01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:34.250
Just take it.

901
01:03:35.666 --> 01:03:36.791
Thank you, sir.

902
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:41.916
A mixed-genre concept
will attract millions of viewers.

903
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.541
But I believe we can be
more successful than Ndaru.

904
01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:47.666
We just gotta focus.

905
01:03:48.166 --> 01:03:52.166
We just need to decide
between koplo or keroncong.

906
01:04:55.583 --> 01:04:58.750
See? Konco Seneng will be just like them.

907
01:05:00.208 --> 01:05:03.083
Everyone! Please welcome, Konco Seneng!

908
01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:05.458
Konco Seneng!

909
01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:07.291
Why do you keep staring up like that?

910
01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:09.208
I'm looking at my career, Nov.

911
01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:11.458
I see.

912
01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:12.791
Me too. Look.

913
01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:14.458
Why are you looking down?

914
01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:16.166
I'm looking at our competitors.

915
01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:19.625
-Get ready, guys.
-Right.

916
01:05:19.708 --> 01:05:22.041
Potential successful people.

917
01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:25.458
For our future.

918
01:05:49.833 --> 01:05:50.708
Well, Uncle?

919
01:05:50.791 --> 01:05:54.833
Which one's better,
the first or the second one?

920
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:05.500
I don't think any of them
have a chance of going viral.

921
01:06:11.583 --> 01:06:12.458
Uncle.

922
01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:15.958
Listen to this one.

923
01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:17.958
It's our backup song.

924
01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:21.041
I'm not interested in taking risks.

925
01:06:24.083 --> 01:06:25.250
I'm sorry, everyone.

926
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.458
I've got a meeting at city hall.

927
01:06:30.958 --> 01:06:33.208
Uncle. Uncle Mahen!

928
01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:35.208
Uncle.

929
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:36.916
Uncle.

930
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.333
With your experience
working at a record label,

931
01:06:39.416 --> 01:06:42.416
surely you can recognize a good song.

932
01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:45.583
Both of Konco Seneng's songs
are great, Uncle.

933
01:06:47.625 --> 01:06:49.416
That's not the issue, Bethari.

934
01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:55.166
The reason I came to the palace that day

935
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:57.375
was to ask your uncle for a favor.

936
01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:00.958
My label is on the verge of collapse.

937
01:07:01.708 --> 01:07:03.458
None of my musicians are succeeding.

938
01:07:05.083 --> 01:07:09.208
Your uncle, Argo, agreed to help me
avoid bankruptcy on one condition.

939
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:12.583
That I don't become
Konco Seneng's producer.

940
01:07:29.333 --> 01:07:31.333
Rick. Rick!

941
01:07:31.416 --> 01:07:32.708
I didn't see this coming, Rick.

942
01:07:36.166 --> 01:07:37.791
What do you mean, Ru?

943
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.416
"Nothing can stop us."

944
01:07:40.958 --> 01:07:43.333
"Konco Seneng will be
Uncle Mahen's pride and joy."

945
01:07:43.416 --> 01:07:45.500
So who's the liar here? You or Mahen?

946
01:07:47.625 --> 01:07:48.666
Rick.

947
01:07:49.291 --> 01:07:50.333
You planned this, right?

948
01:07:50.416 --> 01:07:52.000
You and Bethari planned this

949
01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:55.291
to make us believe you were amazing
and to make you our leader!

950
01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:57.291
-Of course we didn't.
-Rick, calm down.

951
01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:00.250
You acted all high and mighty with Bethari
offering opportunities,

952
01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:01.250
but look at us!

953
01:08:01.333 --> 01:08:02.833
-Bethari…
-You gave us false hope!

954
01:08:05.041 --> 01:08:07.541
Bethari has done a lot for Konco Seneng.

955
01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:08.875
Done what?

956
01:08:08.958 --> 01:08:10.791
Has Konco Seneng made it?

957
01:08:10.875 --> 01:08:12.333
No, Ru!

958
01:08:12.416 --> 01:08:13.750
I'm still struggling!

959
01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:16.291
Everyone was already imagining
being happy, Ru!

960
01:08:16.833 --> 01:08:18.708
Novian was imagining success!

961
01:08:18.791 --> 01:08:21.375
He imagined his wife not scolding him
when he came home!

962
01:08:21.458 --> 01:08:23.208
Wahyu imagined paying his debts!

963
01:08:23.291 --> 01:08:24.375
And I!

964
01:08:24.458 --> 01:08:27.458
I imagined proving to my dad
that I could succeed through music!

965
01:08:27.541 --> 01:08:28.500
You bastard!

966
01:08:28.583 --> 01:08:30.375
Rick, calm down.

967
01:08:30.458 --> 01:08:32.041
You want to lead the band?

968
01:08:32.125 --> 01:08:34.166
A leader leads by example!

969
01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:35.166
What are you?

970
01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:38.750
You have a bachelor's degree,
but you only help your mom sell batik!

971
01:08:40.958 --> 01:08:42.000
Rick.

972
01:08:43.083 --> 01:08:44.375
I'm still better than you.

973
01:08:45.541 --> 01:08:46.791
What about you?

974
01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:51.500
Every time I meet your dad,
he just complains.

975
01:08:52.708 --> 01:08:54.583
He wants you to get a job

976
01:08:54.666 --> 01:08:56.625
and work like your friends.

977
01:08:57.291 --> 01:08:58.333
But you…

978
01:08:59.416 --> 01:09:03.583
You're an adult, yet you're still
depending on your parents.

979
01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:04.833
Don't act so proud.

980
01:09:05.916 --> 01:09:09.583
You bastard! It's you who acts proud!

981
01:09:09.666 --> 01:09:11.583
I've told you a thousand times.

982
01:09:12.208 --> 01:09:14.833
Konco Seneng could ask Ndarboy for help!

983
01:09:14.916 --> 01:09:18.041
But you won't because of your goddamn ego!

984
01:09:18.125 --> 01:09:21.583
This band doesn't bring happiness,
it makes us go nuts!

985
01:09:21.666 --> 01:09:23.250
-Asshole!
-Rick.

986
01:09:24.708 --> 01:09:25.750
Calm down, Rick.

987
01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.208
Don't you dare butt in!

988
01:09:32.291 --> 01:09:34.333
Konco Seneng has been going downhill
ever since Jeru began dating you!

989
01:09:35.375 --> 01:09:37.708
Don't yell at her. It's inappropriate.

990
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:38.958
Inappropriate?

991
01:09:39.666 --> 01:09:42.541
Your relationship with Bethari is toxic!
Toxic for Konco Seneng!

992
01:09:42.625 --> 01:09:45.125
-Fuck off!
-Jeru!

993
01:09:45.583 --> 01:09:49.041
So full of yourself! Acting like a thug!
You think I'm scared?

994
01:09:50.041 --> 01:09:52.375
-Rick!
-Rick!

995
01:09:52.458 --> 01:09:53.500
-Enough.
-Enough.

996
01:09:53.583 --> 01:09:57.041
-Stop!
-That's enough.

997
01:09:57.125 --> 01:09:59.000
Rick. Calm down.

998
01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:03.750
You're the arrogant one!
Everyone has to do things your way!

999
01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:05.125
-Rick…
-Bastard!

1000
01:10:06.916 --> 01:10:08.583
I'm leaving Konco Seneng.

1001
01:10:09.791 --> 01:10:11.333
We might as well disband it!

1002
01:10:31.166 --> 01:10:35.750
The palace generously took in
your husband as a sweeper.

1003
01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:39.458
After he passed away,

1004
01:10:40.166 --> 01:10:43.583
you were entrusted
with the palace's batik shop

1005
01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.958
so you could make a living

1006
01:10:47.708 --> 01:10:50.000
and send Jeru to college.

1007
01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:59.000
And now you repay His Majesty's generosity
by shaming the palace?!

1008
01:10:59.083 --> 01:11:00.500
No, Your Highness.

1009
01:11:01.375 --> 01:11:02.500
I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness.

1010
01:11:11.833 --> 01:11:13.833
Your uncle isn't fair, Thari.

1011
01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:16.958
He's unfair.

1012
01:11:20.875 --> 01:11:22.208
This relationship…

1013
01:11:24.458 --> 01:11:25.958
can't go on anymore.

1014
01:11:30.875 --> 01:11:32.125
Let's break up, Ru.

1015
01:11:37.666 --> 01:11:38.750
What?

1016
01:11:41.625 --> 01:11:43.333
So that His Highness Argo

1017
01:11:44.708 --> 01:11:46.291
will leave you alone.

1018
01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:49.666
So he'll leave Konco Seneng alone.

1019
01:11:57.583 --> 01:11:59.416
Konco Seneng has disbanded, Thari.

1020
01:12:01.333 --> 01:12:02.416
What now?

1021
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.500
I've lost Konco Seneng.

1022
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:09.625
I've lost my best friend.

1023
01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:17.041
I don't want to lose you too, Thari.

1024
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.875
It's all my fault, Ru.

1025
01:12:23.291 --> 01:12:25.000
It's all my fault.

1026
01:12:38.958 --> 01:12:42.541
Why are you still seeing
Her Highness Bethari?

1027
01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:47.958
Well…

1028
01:12:48.875 --> 01:12:50.250
I don't know, Mom.

1029
01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:53.875
For love, Mom.

1030
01:12:54.875 --> 01:12:56.625
But you both know

1031
01:12:57.625 --> 01:12:59.208
that your love is different.

1032
01:13:01.125 --> 01:13:02.416
If I could choose,

1033
01:13:04.791 --> 01:13:07.250
I'd love to be a king's child, Mom.

1034
01:13:10.375 --> 01:13:13.333
But love is love.

1035
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:17.666
It doesn't discriminate between
royal blood or common blood.

1036
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:20.541
A king's child or a servant's.

1037
01:13:21.625 --> 01:13:23.333
That's what we're fighting for.

1038
01:13:26.625 --> 01:13:27.875
I know for sure…

1039
01:13:30.416 --> 01:13:32.500
that I have a wise mother

1040
01:13:34.125 --> 01:13:36.416
who always supports her son's choices,

1041
01:13:37.208 --> 01:13:41.125
as long as they are right
and responsible, Mom.

1042
01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:49.083
Just like how you supported me
in pursuing music…

1043
01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:58.250
and didn't push me to find a job
relevant to my degree.

1044
01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:01.958
But, Mom,

1045
01:14:03.416 --> 01:14:05.333
I am really sorry.

1046
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:11.625
I'm going to stay in my relationship
with Bethari.

1047
01:14:31.916 --> 01:14:33.541
Okay then, it's fine…

1048
01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:37.875
if that's the choice you've made.

1049
01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:46.583
Starting tomorrow,
we'll sell batik door to door

1050
01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:48.875
or at the market.

1051
01:14:50.666 --> 01:14:51.833
What about this shop?

1052
01:14:54.125 --> 01:14:56.791
I will return this batik shop
to the palace.

1053
01:14:58.333 --> 01:14:59.541
We did wrong.

1054
01:15:02.041 --> 01:15:04.500
We couldn't repay their generosity.

1055
01:15:07.166 --> 01:15:08.833
But we have our dignity.

1056
01:15:12.083 --> 01:15:14.500
I don't mind losing the batik shop.

1057
01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:24.166
But we still have the right
to live our own lives.

1058
01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:26.708
Mom.

1059
01:15:37.083 --> 01:15:39.375
Your struggle will not be in vain, Mom.

1060
01:15:48.166 --> 01:15:49.916
Here you are, Your Highness.

1061
01:15:50.666 --> 01:15:52.625
RECEIPT BOOK

1062
01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.208
Thank you, Your Highness,

1063
01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:05.208
for letting me provide for my family
through the batik shop.

1064
01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:07.916
And Jeru?

1065
01:16:08.666 --> 01:16:10.458
My apologies, Your Highness.

1066
01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:15.375
Jeru's decision is entirely up to him.

1067
01:16:17.416 --> 01:16:18.791
I beg your forgiveness.

1068
01:16:51.458 --> 01:16:52.625
Did you do it?

1069
01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:54.708
Yes, dear.

1070
01:16:56.416 --> 01:16:57.708
Fight for it.

1071
01:16:58.833 --> 01:17:01.125
Yes, Mom. I'll go call her.

1072
01:17:15.333 --> 01:17:16.500
Hello, Thari.

1073
01:17:16.583 --> 01:17:19.375
This number no longer belongs to Bethari.

1074
01:17:37.416 --> 01:17:38.875
Sorry, you're not allowed to enter.

1075
01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:40.750
Why? This is the Keraton, a tourist spot.

1076
01:17:40.833 --> 01:17:41.708
-Yes, sir.
-They can enter.

1077
01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:43.083
No entry for you, Jeru.

1078
01:17:43.166 --> 01:17:44.625
I just want to see Her Highness Bethari.

1079
01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:46.791
-You can't.
-This is the palace. Don't make a scene!

1080
01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:48.250
You're the ones making a scene!

1081
01:17:48.333 --> 01:17:50.708
-I just want to go in!
-You can't!

1082
01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:52.750
-Sir!
-Bethari!

1083
01:17:52.833 --> 01:17:54.583
Mind your conduct, sir!

1084
01:17:54.666 --> 01:17:56.375
-Bethari!
-Stop, sir!

1085
01:17:56.458 --> 01:17:57.333
Bethari!

1086
01:17:57.416 --> 01:17:58.125
Forget it!

1087
01:17:58.208 --> 01:17:59.666
Bethari!

1088
01:18:00.958 --> 01:18:02.666
Bethari!

1089
01:18:05.125 --> 01:18:06.791
Watch your mouth, Jeru!

1090
01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:09.666
This is the palace. There are rules!

1091
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:11.125
I want to see Bethari.

1092
01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:13.041
Her Highness Bethari!

1093
01:18:13.666 --> 01:18:15.291
She is His Majesty's daughter,

1094
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:17.291
not the child of a palace sweeper!

1095
01:18:18.916 --> 01:18:20.041
Jeru!

1096
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Bethari has left Solo.

1097
01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:31.791
Where is she?

1098
01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:32.916
Jeru.

1099
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.333
I'm asking you
to stop looking for Bethari.

1100
01:18:36.416 --> 01:18:39.833
There will be no more ties
between you and Bethari.

1101
01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:41.416
If you keep insisting,

1102
01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:44.208
you know who's coming for you.

1103
01:19:20.666 --> 01:19:22.916
DANCE WITH NDARBOY

1104
01:19:43.625 --> 01:19:45.416
Stop the engine.

1105
01:20:07.833 --> 01:20:09.750
Coming home this late! Band again?

1106
01:20:09.833 --> 01:20:12.250
Ndar, if it was that,
I'd have brought the ukulele.

1107
01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:14.083
Maybe you borrowed one!
You're lying, aren't you?

1108
01:20:14.166 --> 01:20:17.291
Let's not make a scene.
The neighbors can hear us.

1109
01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:18.416
Ndar.

1110
01:20:26.208 --> 01:20:27.416
Be a busker for all I care!

1111
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.416
Ndar.

1112
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.500
What head of the family
can't afford school for his kid?

1113
01:20:30.583 --> 01:20:33.125
You owe money just for kindergarten!
Imagine how primary school will be!

1114
01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:34.791
Being in a band doesn't make money!

1115
01:20:34.875 --> 01:20:37.875
Ndar, I'm also working.

1116
01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:39.000
I don't care!

1117
01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:45.041
Idiot. What are you doing?

1118
01:20:45.125 --> 01:20:46.750
Your keys are with me.

1119
01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:48.583
Oh.

1120
01:20:58.083 --> 01:20:59.708
People only see what's on the surface,
right, Yu?

1121
01:21:00.458 --> 01:21:01.500
Yeah.

1122
01:21:26.958 --> 01:21:28.000
Wahyu.

1123
01:21:28.458 --> 01:21:29.541
Let it go.

1124
01:21:31.833 --> 01:21:34.125
Farewell, dreams of my youth.

1125
01:21:34.208 --> 01:21:35.583
Farewell, music.

1126
01:21:37.041 --> 01:21:38.000
CHANGE ACCOUNT

1127
01:21:38.083 --> 01:21:39.166
YES, NO

1128
01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:41.958
I thought Konco Seneng would make it,

1129
01:21:43.125 --> 01:21:44.500
but it didn't.

1130
01:21:46.583 --> 01:21:49.083
I should just return to selling on TokTok.

1131
01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:59.708
No one's here today?

1132
01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:01.791
Konco Seneng has disbanded.

1133
01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:06.833
The band couldn't make
everyone happy anymore.

1134
01:22:07.333 --> 01:22:09.000
It drove people mad instead.

1135
01:22:10.958 --> 01:22:13.458
Music cost me everything, Mom.

1136
01:22:14.625 --> 01:22:18.250
I lost the one I love, my best friend,

1137
01:22:19.541 --> 01:22:21.416
and the batik shop.

1138
01:22:23.291 --> 01:22:24.666
I have a surprise for you.

1139
01:22:25.958 --> 01:22:27.208
Open your eyes!

1140
01:22:28.041 --> 01:22:29.083
Blow it.

1141
01:22:30.583 --> 01:22:31.625
Wow.

1142
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:34.791
Perfect pitch.

1143
01:22:35.333 --> 01:22:36.708
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

1144
01:22:46.166 --> 01:22:47.166
Dad.

1145
01:22:48.291 --> 01:22:49.250
I give up.

1146
01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:11.916
Rikolo.

1147
01:23:13.125 --> 01:23:14.958
The interview's today?

1148
01:23:15.041 --> 01:23:16.083
Yes, Dad.

1149
01:23:17.458 --> 01:23:19.416
You passed the written test,

1150
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:22.208
so the interview should be a breeze.

1151
01:23:23.625 --> 01:23:24.791
Rikolo.

1152
01:23:25.708 --> 01:23:27.875
You're smart.

1153
01:23:28.791 --> 01:23:31.416
You have a bright future ahead of you.

1154
01:23:33.458 --> 01:23:34.291
Wish me luck, Dad.

1155
01:23:34.375 --> 01:23:36.166
-Yes. Take care.
-Yes.

1156
01:24:03.666 --> 01:24:04.666
Yes.

1157
01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:04.916
Thank you so much, Tidar,

1158
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.375
for your help in getting me hired
to teach here.

1159
01:25:08.458 --> 01:25:10.500
Okay. Let's go to the dean's office now.

1160
01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:14.125
Um, wait. Let me introduce you to…

1161
01:25:14.208 --> 01:25:15.166
To who?

1162
01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:16.291
Rick!

1163
01:25:19.333 --> 01:25:20.958
He said he was coming to pick me up.

1164
01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.208
Who's Rick? Your boyfriend?

1165
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:26.541
Not yet.

1166
01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:56.041
Hey, what happened?

1167
01:25:56.125 --> 01:26:01.416
What is happening here?

1168
01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.041
Is he okay?

1169
01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:08.208
Is he going to be okay?

1170
01:27:26.125 --> 01:27:31.125
Rikolo, Ru. Rikolo.

1171
01:27:32.458 --> 01:27:35.666
His mother isn't here anymore, Ru.

1172
01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:41.166
Rikolo is the only hope I have left.

1173
01:28:24.416 --> 01:28:25.458
Rick.

1174
01:28:29.208 --> 01:28:30.750
Please don't go.

1175
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.291
Get well soon, Rick.

1176
01:28:41.125 --> 01:28:44.166
I'll do whatever it takes
for Konco Seneng, Rick.

1177
01:29:02.958 --> 01:29:04.625
DANCE WITH NDARBOY

1178
01:29:05.333 --> 01:29:09.791
No, not like this. We need to slide it.

1179
01:29:12.583 --> 01:29:13.416
Okay.

1180
01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:15.291
Ndaru.

1181
01:29:20.625 --> 01:29:21.666
Jeru?

1182
01:29:28.875 --> 01:29:30.750
What happened? Come here.

1183
01:29:30.833 --> 01:29:32.083
I made a mistake.

1184
01:29:33.333 --> 01:29:34.791
I never forgot.

1185
01:29:36.041 --> 01:29:38.125
I haven't ever forgotten
about Konco Seneng.

1186
01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:40.458
You know,

1187
01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:42.166
I reach out to Rick sometimes.

1188
01:29:42.666 --> 01:29:44.208
I've done it several times.

1189
01:29:44.291 --> 01:29:47.541
I ask how you're doing,
and how everyone is.

1190
01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:49.875
But Rick always told me…

1191
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:53.333
that you were still mad at me.

1192
01:29:55.791 --> 01:29:57.333
Rick had an accident, Ru.

1193
01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:01.333
Are you serious? How is he doing?

1194
01:30:04.375 --> 01:30:05.958
Critical.

1195
01:30:06.041 --> 01:30:07.791
Rick, you poor guy.

1196
01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:09.625
I need a favor, Ru.

1197
01:30:10.583 --> 01:30:12.541
Help Konco Seneng succeed.

1198
01:30:23.041 --> 01:30:24.083
Rick.

1199
01:30:25.125 --> 01:30:27.583
I've finally overcome my ego, Rick.

1200
01:30:29.125 --> 01:30:31.125
I met Ndaru yesterday.

1201
01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:35.708
Everything you dreamed of

1202
01:30:37.541 --> 01:30:38.875
will come true, Rick.

1203
01:30:45.833 --> 01:30:46.750
Rick.

1204
01:30:47.166 --> 01:30:49.083
Rick. What's wrong?

1205
01:30:50.125 --> 01:30:53.250
Rick! What's happening?

1206
01:30:56.083 --> 01:30:59.500
Nurse! Doctor! Help!

1207
01:30:59.583 --> 01:31:01.208
Rick! Nurse.

1208
01:31:01.291 --> 01:31:02.541
Please wait outside, sir.

1209
01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:03.666
What about my friend?

1210
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:05.583
Please move, sir.
The doctor will handle it.

1211
01:31:05.666 --> 01:31:06.750
Rick!

1212
01:31:06.833 --> 01:31:08.208
Rick!

1213
01:31:09.916 --> 01:31:10.791
Rick!

1214
01:31:17.125 --> 01:31:18.416
It's critical, Doctor.

1215
01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:20.666
-No pulse detected. CPR, now.
-Right.

1216
01:32:12.208 --> 01:32:13.416
Hello.

1217
01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:15.958
Hello, Doc.

1218
01:32:16.041 --> 01:32:17.291
-Sir.
-Doc.

1219
01:32:19.375 --> 01:32:22.750
We're ready to accept what's meant to be

1220
01:32:23.958 --> 01:32:26.291
if this is how things must go, Doc.

1221
01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:27.083
Sir.

1222
01:32:27.166 --> 01:32:29.666
We're ready to accept any sad news.

1223
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:31.083
Gentlemen…

1224
01:32:31.166 --> 01:32:33.166
There will be no sad news.

1225
01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:35.416
Rick has regained consciousness.

1226
01:32:38.666 --> 01:32:40.333
-Are you serious, Doc?
-Yes.

1227
01:32:41.208 --> 01:32:43.541
Alhamdulillah, Doc!

1228
01:32:43.625 --> 01:32:46.958
Alhamdulillah. Thank you, Doctor.

1229
01:32:47.041 --> 01:32:49.291
You're welcome.

1230
01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:50.958
Novian.

1231
01:32:53.916 --> 01:32:57.541
Visits are allowed,
but only for two people.

1232
01:32:57.625 --> 01:32:58.750
Please.

1233
01:32:58.833 --> 01:33:01.583
Alhamdulillah, Ya Allah.

1234
01:33:01.666 --> 01:33:02.875
Let's go in.

1235
01:33:04.041 --> 01:33:08.083
Jeru, you should go. Jeru and Aruna.

1236
01:33:09.333 --> 01:33:10.500
Go!

1237
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.291
Come on.

1238
01:33:13.375 --> 01:33:14.958
Alhamdulillah.

1239
01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:19.541
Rick is out of the critical phase,

1240
01:33:19.625 --> 01:33:21.625
but he must continue resting for now.

1241
01:33:21.708 --> 01:33:23.708
-Thank you, Doc.
-Thank you.

1242
01:33:28.458 --> 01:33:30.416
-Thanks, Doc.
-You're welcome.

1243
01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:31.416
Rick.

1244
01:33:36.625 --> 01:33:37.666
Aruna.

1245
01:33:39.375 --> 01:33:42.500
I just… had a dream.

1246
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.458
Konco Seneng…

1247
01:33:47.958 --> 01:33:49.375
was performing…

1248
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.500
on a huge stage…

1249
01:33:59.875 --> 01:34:04.666
alongside top campursari stars.

1250
01:34:07.833 --> 01:34:09.250
It was a blast.

1251
01:34:27.333 --> 01:34:29.000
Aunty. Aunty Yeni.

1252
01:34:29.083 --> 01:34:30.875
Aunty.

1253
01:34:31.333 --> 01:34:33.375
You know where Bethari is, right?

1254
01:34:35.083 --> 01:34:36.208
Aunty.

1255
01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:42.291
Huh?

1256
01:34:43.333 --> 01:34:46.041
Sister, why are you here?

1257
01:34:46.125 --> 01:34:48.250
Aunty Yeni is busy.

1258
01:34:53.375 --> 01:34:57.166
Right. She also mentioned

1259
01:34:57.250 --> 01:34:58.500
that Jeru came here.

1260
01:35:00.166 --> 01:35:02.416
What did she tell him?

1261
01:35:03.541 --> 01:35:05.708
She couldn't say anything.

1262
01:35:06.791 --> 01:35:08.291
You know how it is.

1263
01:35:08.375 --> 01:35:11.583
She's scared of His Highness Argo.

1264
01:35:18.083 --> 01:35:19.458
-Make it happen.
-Of course.

1265
01:35:19.541 --> 01:35:21.166
-It will be huge.
-Huge, huge.

1266
01:35:21.250 --> 01:35:24.583
Hey. Konco Seneng.

1267
01:35:24.666 --> 01:35:27.958
These guys are Novian, Wahyu, and Rick.

1268
01:35:28.041 --> 01:35:31.500
I will be their producer, Uncle.

1269
01:35:32.291 --> 01:35:35.208
Wait. Why do you all look so pale?

1270
01:35:35.291 --> 01:35:37.041
You all came by motorcycle?

1271
01:35:37.125 --> 01:35:38.833
Your band uses motorcycles?

1272
01:35:38.916 --> 01:35:41.375
So humble. They're humble people.

1273
01:35:41.458 --> 01:35:44.083
It's not really about being humble.

1274
01:35:44.166 --> 01:35:45.333
All we have are motorcycles.

1275
01:35:45.416 --> 01:35:46.833
What do you call that, Yu?

1276
01:35:47.333 --> 01:35:50.041
-Modest?
-Not modest. It's…

1277
01:35:51.208 --> 01:35:52.333
-Broke.
-Yeah.

1278
01:35:53.458 --> 01:35:56.083
No worries. You can buy a car
when you hit it big.

1279
01:35:56.166 --> 01:35:58.083
-Amen.
-Amen.

1280
01:35:58.166 --> 01:35:59.125
Uncle Mahen. How are you?

1281
01:35:59.208 --> 01:36:00.750
I'm good. How are you?

1282
01:36:00.833 --> 01:36:01.791
We're fine.

1283
01:36:01.875 --> 01:36:04.166
Wait, you know each other?

1284
01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:07.791
Yeah, I'm glad to see you guys
working with Ndarboy.

1285
01:36:07.875 --> 01:36:10.208
To be honest, your songs are great.

1286
01:36:10.291 --> 01:36:11.625
But, well…

1287
01:36:11.708 --> 01:36:12.833
We get it, Uncle.

1288
01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.166
We know what happened.

1289
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:18.875
Ndaru.

1290
01:36:18.958 --> 01:36:21.416
Thank you for helping Konco Seneng.

1291
01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:22.750
Hold on.

1292
01:36:23.666 --> 01:36:25.666
Don't thank me.

1293
01:36:26.333 --> 01:36:29.041
Thank Jeru.

1294
01:36:29.458 --> 01:36:32.791
After waiting so long,
Jeru finally came to me the other day.

1295
01:36:32.875 --> 01:36:35.583
We're on good terms now.

1296
01:36:35.666 --> 01:36:37.291
In any case,

1297
01:36:37.375 --> 01:36:40.333
I'm ready to be the producer
for Konco Seneng.

1298
01:36:43.666 --> 01:36:47.041
Hey. It was nicely done.

1299
01:36:47.125 --> 01:36:49.458
WHOLESALE AND RETAIL BATIK SHOP

1300
01:36:52.583 --> 01:36:54.583
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

1301
01:36:55.208 --> 01:36:57.291
Can I pay with this kiris?

1302
01:36:58.083 --> 01:36:59.166
What kiris?

1303
01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:00.500
You bumpkin.

1304
01:37:00.583 --> 01:37:01.833
It's called Kuris.

1305
01:37:02.291 --> 01:37:04.500
-You mean Qris?
-Right.

1306
01:37:04.583 --> 01:37:06.333
-Yes, we accept Qris.
-See?

1307
01:37:06.833 --> 01:37:09.166
My phone's dead. Let me use yours.

1308
01:37:09.250 --> 01:37:10.500
Jeez!

1309
01:37:10.583 --> 01:37:11.541
Bumpkin and broke?

1310
01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:12.541
Pick a struggle.

1311
01:37:12.625 --> 01:37:14.666
Gosh, you're so mean.

1312
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:16.416
Can you?

1313
01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:20.500
It's done.

1314
01:37:20.583 --> 01:37:23.708
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1315
01:37:26.375 --> 01:37:27.541
What are you looking for, mister?

1316
01:37:48.208 --> 01:37:50.000
I was being too harsh to you,

1317
01:37:50.958 --> 01:37:52.791
saying you only sold batik.

1318
01:37:56.916 --> 01:37:58.541
You are better than me.

1319
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:04.958
I'm still living off my parents.

1320
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:17.291
Jeru.

1321
01:38:18.625 --> 01:38:20.666
I'm here to ask you for a favor.

1322
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:24.250
Come back to Konco Seneng.

1323
01:38:24.958 --> 01:38:26.208
Be my vocalist again.

1324
01:38:27.958 --> 01:38:29.875
I'm okay with not being the lead singer.

1325
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.708
I can stick to playing the keyboard.

1326
01:38:35.416 --> 01:38:37.208
The important thing is that you come back.

1327
01:38:39.375 --> 01:38:40.375
Please come back.

1328
01:38:47.625 --> 01:38:48.708
Do you know?

1329
01:38:52.125 --> 01:38:54.000
We're better off as friends.

1330
01:38:54.875 --> 01:38:56.458
Best friends for life, Rick.

1331
01:38:59.958 --> 01:39:01.291
But Konco Seneng…

1332
01:39:02.416 --> 01:39:05.625
Konco Seneng won't go far with me in it.

1333
01:39:11.250 --> 01:39:12.583
Trust me, Rick.

1334
01:39:15.333 --> 01:39:16.583
You will succeed

1335
01:39:17.083 --> 01:39:18.541
as the lead vocalist of Konco Seneng.

1336
01:39:20.875 --> 01:39:22.583
I wish you'd come back.

1337
01:39:23.583 --> 01:39:24.833
Come back to Konco Seneng.

1338
01:39:27.625 --> 01:39:28.666
Please, Ru.

1339
01:39:37.041 --> 01:39:39.500
I'll take care of the budget

1340
01:39:39.583 --> 01:39:42.458
for the first YouTube shoot with Ndarboy.

1341
01:39:42.916 --> 01:39:44.333
It has to go viral, Mahen.

1342
01:39:45.333 --> 01:39:47.500
If you want it to go viral,

1343
01:39:47.583 --> 01:39:49.500
the first episodes should feature

1344
01:39:49.583 --> 01:39:52.000
Happy Asmara, Gilga Sahid…

1345
01:39:52.083 --> 01:39:53.500
Yes, that's fine.

1346
01:39:54.125 --> 01:39:55.416
That's even better.

1347
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.125
I'll have the budget ready.

1348
01:40:03.875 --> 01:40:05.416
Your Highness,
I forgot where the restroom is.

1349
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.041
Go straight and turn left at the pavilion.

1350
01:40:10.125 --> 01:40:11.375
-Excuse me for a bit.
-Okay.

1351
01:40:15.208 --> 01:40:16.375
Your Highness.

1352
01:40:26.375 --> 01:40:27.416
Your Highness.

1353
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:29.833
I'd like to apologize.

1354
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:32.416
I should have taken the risk back then

1355
01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:35.750
and not let His Highness Argo
control the shares.

1356
01:40:35.833 --> 01:40:38.458
I should have stepped up and been
the producer for Konco Seneng.

1357
01:40:40.583 --> 01:40:41.708
Your Highness,

1358
01:40:42.875 --> 01:40:44.583
as my apology,

1359
01:40:44.666 --> 01:40:46.375
I'd like to be your producer.

1360
01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:49.333
-Me?
-Yes.

1361
01:40:51.583 --> 01:40:52.708
I'd love to.

1362
01:40:53.833 --> 01:40:55.416
But…

1363
01:40:56.291 --> 01:40:57.750
it's impossible.

1364
01:40:57.833 --> 01:40:59.291
I'm not allowed to leave the palace.

1365
01:40:59.375 --> 01:41:02.166
Don't worry, Your Highness.
I'll take care of it.

1366
01:41:35.791 --> 01:41:36.666
Jeru!

1367
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.041
Bethari!

1368
01:41:56.375 --> 01:42:00.000
Thari, where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

1369
01:42:06.708 --> 01:42:07.916
Yes, I know.

1370
01:42:08.625 --> 01:42:11.666
Aunty Yeni was afraid to go against
His Highness Argo.

1371
01:42:12.875 --> 01:42:16.458
She couldn't say that
I was still at the Keraton.

1372
01:42:25.875 --> 01:42:26.958
Oh?

1373
01:42:27.041 --> 01:42:28.875
You ran into each other already.

1374
01:42:31.625 --> 01:42:32.666
Bethari.

1375
01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:36.333
This project isn't just my apology to you,

1376
01:42:37.958 --> 01:42:39.333
but also to Jeru.

1377
01:42:41.875 --> 01:42:44.041
I want to make you two into a duo.

1378
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.333
What about Uncle Argo?

1379
01:42:49.416 --> 01:42:51.583
I'll handle him.

1380
01:42:52.125 --> 01:42:56.208
I hope your duet can boost
the Keraton palace's reputation.

1381
01:42:59.416 --> 01:43:01.833
Let's do this. Come on.

1382
01:43:19.166 --> 01:43:21.125
You ungrateful bastard!

1383
01:43:21.666 --> 01:43:24.791
You begged me to help your failing label,

1384
01:43:24.875 --> 01:43:26.750
and now that I've helped, you do this?

1385
01:43:28.291 --> 01:43:29.416
Uncle Argo.

1386
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.416
I am not talking to you!

1387
01:43:32.125 --> 01:43:34.333
That sweeper's son is out of line!

1388
01:43:34.416 --> 01:43:37.083
Who gave Bethari permission to leave,
Your Highness?

1389
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.750
I did, Your Highness.

1390
01:43:42.458 --> 01:43:45.958
I asked Mahen to take Bethari
out of the Keraton palace.

1391
01:43:46.791 --> 01:43:51.208
What you did to my little sister,
Bethari, is unacceptable.

1392
01:43:51.291 --> 01:43:54.833
Just because His Majesty
puts his trust in you,

1393
01:43:54.916 --> 01:43:56.291
you misuse that power.

1394
01:43:56.375 --> 01:44:00.791
Your Highness, everything I've done is
for the honor of the Keraton palace!

1395
01:44:00.875 --> 01:44:04.250
This will only bring shame to the palace,
Your Highness.

1396
01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:09.708
I'm sure that if His Majesty finds out,

1397
01:44:09.791 --> 01:44:12.666
he will be very disappointed in you.

1398
01:44:15.333 --> 01:44:19.541
Your standing
as His Majesty's trusted aide

1399
01:44:21.041 --> 01:44:22.458
will be over.

1400
01:44:40.291 --> 01:44:43.916
NDARBOY PRODUCER
FOR KONCO SENENG'S FIRST SINGLE!

1401
01:44:45.041 --> 01:44:47.000
JE-THAR GOES VIRAL

1402
01:44:47.083 --> 01:44:49.208
JE-THAR DUET CAPTIVATES
INDONESIAN MUSIC LISTENERS

1403
01:44:50.541 --> 01:44:52.958
Guys! We'll perform in Taiwan next week!

1404
01:44:53.041 --> 01:44:54.708
KONCO SENENG TO PERFORM IN TAIWAN
SAVE THE DATE!

1405
01:44:54.791 --> 01:44:57.958
I always believed that
Konco Seneng would make it big.

1406
01:44:58.041 --> 01:45:00.583
But success takes effort.

1407
01:45:00.666 --> 01:45:04.250
It's not as easy as
flipping an elephant's foot.

1408
01:45:04.333 --> 01:45:06.000
Obviously.

1409
01:45:06.708 --> 01:45:07.958
You dummy.

1410
01:45:12.708 --> 01:45:14.291
That's enough.

1411
01:45:17.583 --> 01:45:20.333
Wait, what? So you're dating?

1412
01:45:20.416 --> 01:45:21.500
You're officially dating?

1413
01:45:21.583 --> 01:45:22.750
Not yet.

1414
01:45:22.833 --> 01:45:24.791
Oh, not yet?

1415
01:45:24.875 --> 01:45:25.875
Okay, fine.

1416
01:45:25.958 --> 01:45:27.458
Wait, Na.

1417
01:45:27.541 --> 01:45:29.333
We are dating.

1418
01:45:29.416 --> 01:45:32.000
Geez!

1419
01:47:28.291 --> 01:47:31.708
Konco Seneng!

1420
01:47:33.125 --> 01:47:37.333
-Konco Seneng!
-Konco Seneng!

1421
01:47:38.541 --> 01:47:39.500
Jeru!

1422
01:47:39.583 --> 01:47:41.125
Rick!

1423
01:47:41.208 --> 01:47:43.458
Novian! Konco Senang!

1424
01:47:43.541 --> 01:47:45.833
Wahyu!

1425
01:47:46.708 --> 01:47:48.291
Novian!

1426
01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:52.916
Bethari!

1427
01:48:08.083 --> 01:48:09.875
Thank you, Mom.

1428
01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.500
Dad! Come forward!

1429
01:48:22.583 --> 01:48:23.708
Me?

1430
01:48:42.250 --> 01:48:44.083
I'm proud of you, son.

1431
01:49:24.458 --> 01:49:25.875
Indar! Bella!

1432
01:50:18.333 --> 01:50:19.708
Konco Seneng!

1433
01:50:19.791 --> 01:50:21.875
Konco Seneng!

1434
01:50:21.958 --> 01:50:25.625
KONCO SENENG AND JE-THAR CONCERT
