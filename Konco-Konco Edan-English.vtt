1
00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:07.041
This place is so scary.

2
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.483
Still a long way to go?

3
00:00:10.632 --> 00:00:11.608
Almost there.

4
00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:26.559
Good morning to all of you.

5
00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:28.517
For those of you
who just join us...

6
00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:30.583
...don't forget
to tap your screens.

7
00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:33.478
Let me repeat this for you...

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.392
...2,5 grams of gold
is in display case number one.

9
00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:42.601
I will give you a bonus of
one gram of gold for all of you.

10
00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.059
But only if you buy five.

11
00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:47.958
"I've bought the one
in display case number three."

12
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.101
Okay, David!

13
00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:51.892
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

14
00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:53.517
Come on, who else will buy?

15
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:56.150
Pay the item immediately.
What are you waiting for?

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.333
Is your salary deducted again?

17
00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:02.583
When will you save money?

18
00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:06.983
Dad wants the Innova
as the dowry.

19
00:01:08.217 --> 00:01:11.220
Would you accept a set
of gardening tools as the dowry?

20
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:11.983
No!

21
00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:15.358
Just ask for your part
of the inheritance.

22
00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:17.233
A part of this
jewelry store is yours.

23
00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:19.225
This again.

24
00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:22.067
Don't let The General know that
you're courting during work.

25
00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:24.916
Hey, take it slow!

26
00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:26.726
I'm his grandson.

27
00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:29.567
As long as he's not here,
I'm the one in charge.

28
00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:32.093
Manager. Right?

29
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.280
Is he behind me?

30
00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:40.775
I'm at your disposal, General!

31
00:01:42.823 --> 00:01:44.073
Hurry!

32
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.250
Met, don't be a slug.

33
00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:49.858
Chop chop.

34
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.541
Lift it!

35
00:01:57.935 --> 00:01:58.976
Come on, lift it!

36
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.351
- Bolay!
- Yes, General!

37
00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:04.583
- Make me a coffee.
- Yes, Sir!

38
00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:07.433
- Kubil.
- Yes, General.

39
00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:08.833
- Five more times.
- Yes, Sir!

40
00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:10.934
Mamet, lift it!

41
00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:12.559
It's heavy, General.

42
00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:14.226
Of course
a tractor's tire is heavy.

43
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.726
What's light is a cracker.

44
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.400
Yes, Sir.

45
00:02:17.632 --> 00:02:18.983
Mamet, finish the task!

46
00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:27.642
This is lighter
than a man's responsibility.

47
00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:29.916
Got it?
How would you be a husband then?

48
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.166
How would you be a father?

49
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:36.666
Don't embarrass me
as your grandfather.

50
00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:38.916
Why can't you lift that?

51
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:41.041
Just be a tree then.

52
00:02:44.082 --> 00:02:45.434
- Lay. Bil.
- Yes.

53
00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:47.017
- Yes.
- Help him.

54
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.650
Yes, General! We would never
leave a friend, General!

55
00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.830
Come on, you can do it.
Just a little more.

56
00:02:58.317 --> 00:03:00.351
It hurts only in your mind.

57
00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:02.119
Come on, you can do it.

58
00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:03.875
Shut your mouth!

59
00:03:07.774 --> 00:03:10.750
KONCO-KONCO EDAN

60
00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:19.916
Mangku Boys!

61
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:21.584
Yes, General!

62
00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.358
Last month's salary.

63
00:03:25.984 --> 00:03:29.151
I'm deducting it for electricity
and water bill.

64
00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:31.116
For your room's rent fee.

65
00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:33.000
And for food.

66
00:03:33.748 --> 00:03:36.437
Deducting it from Mamet
for giving the wrong price.

67
00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:40.108
It was a 900k bracelet,
but you priced it at 800k.

68
00:03:41.296 --> 00:03:42.654
You incurred a loss, stupid.

69
00:03:49.222 --> 00:03:53.031
I promise not to be stupid.
I'm a nobody.

70
00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:56.066
I'm only a speck of dust.

71
00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:09.623
I'm dying.

72
00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:11.837
Barbaric grandfather!

73
00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:13.279
Jerk!

74
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.542
How can he do this
to his own grandson?

75
00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:21.317
Yes. Just be grateful that
your grandpa is still alive.

76
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.636
Hey, I'm better off alone.

77
00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:26.983
If my parents didn't get into an accident.
I wouldn't live with him.

78
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:28.775
I hate it!

79
00:04:34.227 --> 00:04:34.775
Hello?

80
00:04:35.623 --> 00:04:36.192
Yes, Sir?

81
00:04:38.352 --> 00:04:39.108
Yes.

82
00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:43.915
No, Sir. Rena is not my wife.

83
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:45.543
She's my girlfriend.

84
00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:47.559
Well, formerly. My ex.

85
00:04:47.643 --> 00:04:51.733
So, one day,
she told me to send her a PAP.

86
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.458
PAP means a selfie photo, Sir.

87
00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:59.041
She told me to take a selfie
with my ID card. So, I did it.

88
00:05:00.248 --> 00:05:01.915
I wasn't suspicious at all
at first.

89
00:05:02.504 --> 00:05:06.275
It turns out that
she borrowed money with my data.

90
00:05:10.388 --> 00:05:10.775
What?

91
00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:12.817
I have to pay it back
in a week?

92
00:05:13.373 --> 00:05:15.331
Why am I the one who should
take responsibility for this?

93
00:05:16.344 --> 00:05:18.011
Hello, Sir? Sir?

94
00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:23.500
Oh, dear!
What should I do, Met?

95
00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:25.783
Who cares?
It's your ex.

96
00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:27.235
I want to take a shower.

97
00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:29.609
Bil.

98
00:05:30.756 --> 00:05:31.692
I'm sleepy.

99
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.108
Oh, God! How can nobody care
about their own friend?

100
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:39.192
Mangku Boys!

101
00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:40.400
Yes, General!

102
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.650
- A vacation?
- Yes, to Labuan Bajo.

103
00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:44.941
On what occasion?

104
00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:46.317
Ouch!

105
00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:49.871
A vacation, Met!

106
00:05:50.754 --> 00:05:53.546
- You still ask about it?
- No, General.

107
00:05:53.998 --> 00:05:56.831
General, permission to speak.
When will we go, General?

108
00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:57.897
- Next week.
- Yes, Sir.

109
00:05:58.333 --> 00:05:59.150
Permission to speak, General.

110
00:06:00.164 --> 00:06:02.080
If you deduct it
from our salary...

111
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:03.733
...we won't have any money then.

112
00:06:06.458 --> 00:06:07.483
I won't deduct it.

113
00:06:08.214 --> 00:06:10.506
I'm paying for everything.

114
00:06:11.208 --> 00:06:12.958
- Seriously, General?
- Do you accept it?

115
00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:14.341
Yes, General!

116
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.726
Are we vacationing
or moving here?

117
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.791
Asking me?!

118
00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:31.601
- Grab a taxi here!
- Move!

119
00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:32.726
- Please.
- Grab a taxi here.

120
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.934
We have a big van for our taxi.

121
00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.142
Need a taxi?

122
00:06:39.167 --> 00:06:40.817
It can fit a lot of people.
Just check it out first.

123
00:06:40.842 --> 00:06:44.397
We can negotiate the price later.
We have a big van.

124
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.400
- Is this the car?
- That's right.

125
00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:48.317
We can negotiate
the price later.

126
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.725
- Mangku Boys!
- Yes, General!

127
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.291
- Lay, hurry up!
- Next time, okay?

128
00:06:54.666 --> 00:06:57.309
- Taxi!
- Grab a taxi here!

129
00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:58.916
This is our car.

130
00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:06.275
Cheap old man.

131
00:07:06.604 --> 00:07:09.226
He doesn't even want to rent a proper car
although he's rich.

132
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.395
That's the thing.
He has a lot of jewelry stores.

133
00:07:11.694 --> 00:07:14.944
Vacation? Who rides
a pickup truck for vacation?

134
00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:17.729
He's your grandfather.

135
00:07:18.683 --> 00:07:20.275
Why don't you say that
to his face?

136
00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:23.983
Say it to his face, quick.
Stop sulking.

137
00:07:25.207 --> 00:07:29.500
Why do we ride this? Nobody
go on a vacation with this.

138
00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:31.925
We're still on vacation,
but this isn't ideal.

139
00:07:40.446 --> 00:07:41.672
What a nice hotel.

140
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.101
- Let's go in.
- Welcome, Sir.

141
00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:44.858
- Thank you.
- This is a real vacation.

142
00:07:45.178 --> 00:07:46.886
I don't mind riding a truck
for this.

143
00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:50.791
Hello, Herman!

144
00:07:52.145 --> 00:07:53.946
Long time no see!

145
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:57.892
- Your family's well?
- They're well.

146
00:07:57.989 --> 00:07:59.031
Thank God.

147
00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:02.392
You look chubbier.
Watch your belly.

148
00:08:02.522 --> 00:08:03.564
Yes, Sir.

149
00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:08.310
Be patient, honey.
Stop being mad.

150
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.601
No!
I'm not giving you permission.

151
00:08:10.704 --> 00:08:12.579
What should I do then?

152
00:08:12.961 --> 00:08:14.736
I'm already here, honey.

153
00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:17.268
I don't care!
You should protest.

154
00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:19.559
Tell him you don't want to,
that you want to go home.

155
00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:20.750
O... Okay.

156
00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:22.892
Are you not my future husband?

157
00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:25.267
- I... I am.
- You should be assertive then!

158
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:26.392
Yes, honey.

159
00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:27.851
Just say what I say.

160
00:08:27.875 --> 00:08:29.684
- "I don't want to!"
- I don't want to!

161
00:08:29.708 --> 00:08:31.642
- "No way!"
- No way!

162
00:08:31.666 --> 00:08:33.809
- "Don't feel entitled!"
- Don't feel entitled!

163
00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:36.267
- "Don't be a dictator!"
- Don't be a dictator!

164
00:08:36.337 --> 00:08:37.837
"You old fart."

165
00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:39.449
You old fart!

166
00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:42.150
Met?

167
00:08:43.247 --> 00:08:44.622
Why aren't you answering me?

168
00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:46.625
Honey, I have to go.

169
00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:48.500
- It's an expensive call.
- I'm not done yet.

170
00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:50.101
I'll call you later, okay?

171
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:51.567
- Mamet!
- Bye.

172
00:08:55.199 --> 00:08:56.908
We're not gonna
be long here in Bajo.

173
00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:01.517
We're going to Larantuka
by land tomorrow.

174
00:09:02.465 --> 00:09:04.882
From Larantuka,
we're going to cross to Kupang.

175
00:09:05.774 --> 00:09:07.649
From Kupang to Atambua.

176
00:09:08.372 --> 00:09:12.108
And then we're going
to cross to Timor Leste.

177
00:09:13.346 --> 00:09:15.138
Timor Leste is another country.

178
00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:17.435
That's why...

179
00:09:21.791 --> 00:09:22.400
Here.

180
00:09:23.776 --> 00:09:25.151
- Permission to speak, General!
- Yes.

181
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.142
Aren't we on a vacation?

182
00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:28.358
Yes, vacation.

183
00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:30.483
But with a mission.

184
00:09:31.386 --> 00:09:34.150
Permission to speak, General!
What mission?

185
00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:37.309
I will tell you later.

186
00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:37.900
Yes, Sir!

187
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:39.525
This is your room key.

188
00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:44.483
Your hotel is next door.

189
00:09:45.458 --> 00:09:48.250
- Go!
- Yes, General!

190
00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:53.858
Lay.

191
00:09:56.324 --> 00:09:58.449
I've told you
about your grandfather.

192
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.270
That old fart is cheap.

193
00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:02.608
I should've stayed at home.

194
00:10:03.125 --> 00:10:04.375
I'm chill.

195
00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:07.666
I bet The General will ask me
to accompany him in his room.

196
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:10.392
I'm his grandson,
but he cares about you more.

197
00:10:10.455 --> 00:10:12.955
It's because you
can't sell yourself.

198
00:10:14.192 --> 00:10:15.651
Why are you holding on to me?

199
00:10:15.854 --> 00:10:18.646
I'm ready to sleep with you
on the bed.

200
00:10:18.935 --> 00:10:20.727
Why are you scared here?

201
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.684
You're not when you're tortured
by The General.

202
00:10:22.708 --> 00:10:24.309
- No way. Let me go.
- Yes, Sir.

203
00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:26.184
- Let me go, Bill.
- I'm ready to sleep together.

204
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:28.583
- Stop it. Just get some rest.
- Okay, rest.

205
00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:31.184
- Let me go.
- I'm ready to sleep together.

206
00:10:31.208 --> 00:10:32.125
I don't want to.

207
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.517
It's still daytime.

208
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:35.733
Think about later tonight.

209
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:37.802
You will sleep with someone else

210
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:41.072
- We're close to each other.
- The room is big.

211
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.791
Let me go.
I don't want to.

212
00:10:44.164 --> 00:10:47.414
What is this? So noisy.

213
00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:48.892
Embarrassing to our neighbor.

214
00:10:49.095 --> 00:10:51.150
- Yes, embarrassing.
- He's right, Bil. Stop it.

215
00:10:53.833 --> 00:10:55.184
Remind The General
to have dinner.

216
00:10:55.208 --> 00:10:56.583
Right. I'm starving.

217
00:10:58.214 --> 00:11:01.339
General, it's Mamet here.
Permission to come in.

218
00:11:02.735 --> 00:11:04.318
General?

219
00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.916
- Bil!
- General!

220
00:11:09.186 --> 00:11:10.728
General!

221
00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:14.083
General! Oh my God!

222
00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:16.250
Lay! Bil! Ambulance!

223
00:11:17.166 --> 00:11:19.184
Help!

224
00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:20.476
Hurry, Lay!

225
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.208
General!

226
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.517
How is the General doing?

227
00:11:31.541 --> 00:11:32.851
How is my grandfather doing?

228
00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:35.192
We've tried our best.

229
00:11:35.416 --> 00:11:37.108
He had a heart attack.

230
00:11:37.553 --> 00:11:39.553
Sorry, but we couldn't save him.

231
00:11:40.068 --> 00:11:42.900
- Are you serious, Doc?
- You're lying, aren't you?

232
00:11:44.583 --> 00:11:45.483
Doctor!

233
00:11:45.652 --> 00:11:47.693
General!

234
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.125
Why are you leaving us?

235
00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:54.958
Grandfather,
why are you leaving us?

236
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.309
This is lighter
than a man's responsibility.

237
00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:02.108
Got it?

238
00:12:03.388 --> 00:12:04.733
How would you be a husband then?

239
00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:07.542
How would you be a father?

240
00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:11.958
MORGUE.

241
00:12:14.916 --> 00:12:20.083
Sir, I've changed his clothes
as you requested.

242
00:12:20.416 --> 00:12:23.726
- These are his belongings.
- Thank you.

243
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.934
You're welcome.
This is his death certificate...

244
00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.226
...and the letter of permission
for his transport to Jakarta.

245
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.726
We've embalmed the body,
it'll last up to a week.

246
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.726
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

247
00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:38.792
Okay.

248
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.309
General!

249
00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:42.547
General!

250
00:12:43.458 --> 00:12:45.083
General!

251
00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:48.083
Why are you dying on us?

252
00:12:51.192 --> 00:12:54.151
Why did you have a heart attack?

253
00:12:55.721 --> 00:12:58.109
Adelina Bia Carascalao.

254
00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.567
They call her Bia.

255
00:13:00.666 --> 00:13:01.708
Pretty, isn't she?

256
00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:03.583
She is, General.

257
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:07.375
My first wife.

258
00:13:09.304 --> 00:13:11.317
Before I met your grandmother.

259
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:16.208
I was deployed to Timor Timur
for Seroja Operation.

260
00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:17.942
We got married in secret.

261
00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:21.625
When my company
got pulled back to Jakarta...

262
00:13:22.303 --> 00:13:23.553
...she couldn't come with me.

263
00:13:24.458 --> 00:13:27.142
I had searched for her
for three years...

264
00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:28.900
...but I couldn't find her.
I had given up.

265
00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:32.983
Two weeks ago, I got information
about her whereabouts.

266
00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:37.192
So, I won't come home
until I find her.

267
00:13:37.573 --> 00:13:39.573
And what about
the jewelry store?

268
00:13:43.936 --> 00:13:47.853
You've been wishing me dead,
right? To get the store?

269
00:13:50.415 --> 00:13:52.790
Sorry, General,
it's not like that.

270
00:13:53.105 --> 00:13:58.775
Before I knew she was alive,
I had made my first will.

271
00:13:59.225 --> 00:14:02.434
If I die, the jewelry store
will be sold...

272
00:14:03.794 --> 00:14:06.169
...and the money
will be fully donated...

273
00:14:06.303 --> 00:14:08.761
...to orphans.

274
00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:12.587
Three days ago...

275
00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:16.500
...I made my second will.

276
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:22.110
I wrote that the store
will be transferred...

277
00:14:23.287 --> 00:14:24.495
...to Mangku Boys.

278
00:14:25.755 --> 00:14:27.547
Our names are in here.

279
00:14:28.748 --> 00:14:33.665
If I meet her,
I will tear the first will...

280
00:14:34.166 --> 00:14:35.666
...and the second
will will be in effect.

281
00:14:36.416 --> 00:14:38.692
We're rich.
We're rich all of a sudden.

282
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:40.442
But...

283
00:14:41.361 --> 00:14:43.069
...we have to meet her.

284
00:14:44.297 --> 00:14:46.047
If not, well...

285
00:14:46.666 --> 00:14:47.358
...all...

286
00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:50.125
...will be back
to how it used to be.

287
00:14:50.706 --> 00:14:52.290
And the first will
will be in effect.

288
00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.809
We're only taking you
to the woman's address, right?

289
00:14:54.833 --> 00:14:55.317
Yes.

290
00:14:56.309 --> 00:14:58.142
After that,
we'll go our separate ways.

291
00:15:01.304 --> 00:15:03.721
Yes, General!
I'll let the others know.

292
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:05.525
Do it.

293
00:15:06.082 --> 00:15:09.225
But we have to take
The General to Bia...

294
00:15:09.349 --> 00:15:10.767
...in order for the
first will to be torn...

295
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:12.184
...and the second one in effect.

296
00:15:12.241 --> 00:15:13.324
Hey, stupid.

297
00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:15.517
The General is dead.

298
00:15:15.594 --> 00:15:17.650
We only have to tear
the first will. Right?

299
00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:21.125
Read this.
We bury The General here.

300
00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:23.517
We only have to
bring the will to Jakarta.

301
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:24.684
You're right.

302
00:15:24.708 --> 00:15:26.351
No more 50 push-ups
every morning.

303
00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:27.892
No more crawling
under barbed wire.

304
00:15:27.916 --> 00:15:29.017
No more lifting tires.

305
00:15:29.041 --> 00:15:30.583
No more running
around the field.

306
00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:33.500
No! We need
to take The General to Bia.

307
00:15:38.113 --> 00:15:38.817
Move!

308
00:15:40.666 --> 00:15:43.035
Hey, you fake soldier.
Where are you going?

309
00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.226
The mission isn't done yet.

310
00:15:44.304 --> 00:15:46.596
I know you love The General.

311
00:15:46.875 --> 00:15:49.351
You can love,
but don't be stupid.

312
00:15:49.375 --> 00:15:50.275
- Where's the letter?
- No.

313
00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:53.093
If you're not coming, fine.
Move.

314
00:15:55.416 --> 00:15:57.226
Take care of him.
I want no part of this.

315
00:15:57.303 --> 00:15:58.594
He's so stubborn.

316
00:16:00.574 --> 00:16:01.615
Bil...

317
00:16:02.067 --> 00:16:02.442
Bil...

318
00:16:03.502 --> 00:16:05.041
Bil, hey!

319
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:06.906
Do you hear me?

320
00:16:07.125 --> 00:16:08.483
I'm his grandson,
but I don't think about it.

321
00:16:09.026 --> 00:16:10.685
You're no one to him,
so why do you complicate things?

322
00:16:10.937 --> 00:16:12.687
I am no one to The General.

323
00:16:14.316 --> 00:16:15.983
But he saved me.

324
00:16:18.763 --> 00:16:21.471
Since my mother died,
I didn't know what to do.

325
00:16:22.239 --> 00:16:22.983
I didn't know where to live.

326
00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.701
He also encouraged me
to enlist in the military.

327
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.442
Although I failed.

328
00:16:31.067 --> 00:16:32.942
- Because I'm...
- Colorblind.

329
00:16:33.344 --> 00:16:37.469
Yes, but still,
I owe my life to him.

330
00:16:40.292 --> 00:16:42.292
Yeah, I know, Bil.

331
00:16:42.783 --> 00:16:44.733
That's why I thought
what's so hard about taking him?

332
00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:47.067
We have the address.

333
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.150
We have the money.

334
00:16:49.858 --> 00:16:50.608
We have it, right?

335
00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:52.959
Well, The General's money.

336
00:16:53.506 --> 00:16:55.006
He must have some in his wallet.

337
00:16:55.484 --> 00:16:57.276
So, what else do we need?

338
00:17:01.916 --> 00:17:05.125
IF YOU DON'T PAY,
I'LL MAKE THIS PUBLIC.

339
00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.680
Hey, after I think about it,
let's just take him.

340
00:17:12.676 --> 00:17:16.384
The jewelry store will be ours
afterward, right?

341
00:17:17.726 --> 00:17:19.726
I need to repay my debt quickly.

342
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.790
What do you say? Deal?

343
00:17:23.225 --> 00:17:24.266
- Deal.
- Deal.

344
00:17:26.466 --> 00:17:29.049
But how do we take him?

345
00:17:32.416 --> 00:17:34.767
HEARSE.

346
00:17:34.791 --> 00:17:38.192
From Labuan Bajo,
we'll go towards Ende.

347
00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:42.125
From Ende,
we'll cross the sea to Kupang.

348
00:17:43.074 --> 00:17:45.760
From Kupang,
we'll go to Atambua.

349
00:17:46.151 --> 00:17:48.859
It'll be a three-night journey.

350
00:17:49.165 --> 00:17:51.808
Hang on, aren't we supposed
to pass through Tarantula?

351
00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:53.377
You're wrong, Met.

352
00:17:54.041 --> 00:17:56.392
What's its name?
Ah, Marantika!

353
00:17:56.416 --> 00:17:57.601
Not that.

354
00:17:57.625 --> 00:17:58.809
Larantuka?

355
00:17:58.879 --> 00:18:00.650
That's right.

356
00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:03.942
No. No can do.
We're not passing through there.

357
00:18:04.131 --> 00:18:05.714
- We're going through Ende.
- No.

358
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.476
The General said we had
to pass through Larantuka.

359
00:18:08.606 --> 00:18:10.689
Hey, it'll be further.

360
00:18:11.208 --> 00:18:13.858
If you want to,
I'll take you through Ende.

361
00:18:14.081 --> 00:18:17.692
It's fine if you don't want to.
We'll part ways. Up to you.

362
00:18:20.435 --> 00:18:23.352
- Okay, agree.
- We agree. Yes, Ma'am.

363
00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:29.791
That means the jewelry store
is inherited to you?

364
00:18:30.007 --> 00:18:33.025
- Y... Yes. But...
- Okay then.

365
00:18:33.083 --> 00:18:36.101
Just take him there quickly...

366
00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:38.476
...so the store
will be yours immediately. Okay?

367
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.767
So we can marry immediately.

368
00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:40.833
But, hang on, Met.

369
00:18:41.666 --> 00:18:43.291
After we get married...

370
00:18:43.924 --> 00:18:46.221
...register the store under my name.

371
00:18:48.886 --> 00:18:50.136
Report, General!

372
00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:52.256
We're ready to continue
the mission!

373
00:18:53.235 --> 00:18:54.441
We're going to take you to Bia!

374
00:18:55.818 --> 00:18:56.901
We're going to do it!

375
00:19:00.208 --> 00:19:01.250
Do you need help?

376
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:02.791
No.

377
00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:06.775
What's that?

378
00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:09.025
It's a journal book.

379
00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:12.458
"25 before 25."

380
00:19:13.406 --> 00:19:14.448
What does it mean?

381
00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:18.833
I have to have 25 girlfriends
before I turn 25.

382
00:19:19.601 --> 00:19:22.810
Next month, I'll turn 25.

383
00:19:23.105 --> 00:19:24.317
But I still miss one girlfriend.

384
00:19:25.346 --> 00:19:26.358
Is that necessary?

385
00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:27.733
It is.

386
00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.916
By the way, are you single?

387
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:32.150
I'm a widow.

388
00:19:33.278 --> 00:19:38.112
For me, a widow is an angel
ignored by a man's foolishness.

389
00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:40.517
This is what I don't like...

390
00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:42.500
...from the misogynistic
nature of men.

391
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:44.150
If you...

392
00:19:45.625 --> 00:19:46.400
Mangku Boys!

393
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.525
Yes, General!

394
00:19:50.326 --> 00:19:51.868
Half-arm line!

395
00:19:53.307 --> 00:19:54.233
Stand tall!

396
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.691
Let's have a moment of silence.

397
00:20:02.313 --> 00:20:04.396
Finished.

398
00:20:38.907 --> 00:20:41.948
Key, how come you became a widow
at such a young age?

399
00:20:42.094 --> 00:20:43.678
What happened?

400
00:20:43.969 --> 00:20:45.678
I got tricked by a man.

401
00:20:46.009 --> 00:20:47.218
A woman as beautiful as you?

402
00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:51.976
- Did he cheat on you?
- No.

403
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.650
He had a child
from another woman?

404
00:20:54.331 --> 00:20:57.067
- No.
- Did he take your money?

405
00:21:01.274 --> 00:21:03.358
What's going on?
Did we hit something?

406
00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:06.059
There was a know-it-all piglet
crossing the road.

407
00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:08.525
That's why we shouldn't be
a know-it-all pig...

408
00:21:08.708 --> 00:21:10.567
...if we don't want
to get hit and die.

409
00:21:10.929 --> 00:21:12.929
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

410
00:21:22.658 --> 00:21:23.699
Slowly!

411
00:21:26.833 --> 00:21:28.541
Ouch!

412
00:21:33.033 --> 00:21:34.491
Can't you drive slowly?

413
00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:37.033
Hey, you crazy!

414
00:21:45.833 --> 00:21:48.166
This is how the road is
in Flores.

415
00:21:49.916 --> 00:21:52.041
Are you good?
You're good.

416
00:21:52.583 --> 00:21:56.666
Bil, don't throw up here.
You'll make me nauseous too.

417
00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:04.323
Oh dear!

418
00:22:05.116 --> 00:22:05.816
Let it out, Bil.

419
00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:09.476
Stop it, Bil.
You make me nauseous too.

420
00:22:09.526 --> 00:22:11.191
She drives brutally.

421
00:22:11.666 --> 00:22:12.692
My head hurts.

422
00:22:12.944 --> 00:22:13.803
Let it all out, Bil.

423
00:22:17.245 --> 00:22:19.120
- You're good now?
- Good?

424
00:22:20.062 --> 00:22:21.567
- Let me massage you.
- My stomach hurts.

425
00:22:23.645 --> 00:22:26.603
But we need to hurry,
we still have a long way to go.

426
00:22:27.607 --> 00:22:28.774
Be patient.

427
00:22:30.006 --> 00:22:30.608
Hurry up.

428
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.067
Massage him so it all comes out.

429
00:22:33.482 --> 00:22:35.441
Don't keep anything in.

430
00:22:35.727 --> 00:22:36.316
Let it all out.

431
00:22:49.395 --> 00:22:50.520
Oh dear.

432
00:22:56.657 --> 00:22:59.816
You ate well, but why does
your fart smell bad?

433
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.317
It smells so bad.

434
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.358
It stinks!

435
00:23:05.388 --> 00:23:06.430
Oh dear, Key.

436
00:23:07.213 --> 00:23:08.588
Drive safely.

437
00:23:08.942 --> 00:23:09.692
Oh no.

438
00:23:16.739 --> 00:23:19.364
- Do you need help?
- Do you need to ask?

439
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.267
Just help her if you want
to instead of only asking.

440
00:23:22.291 --> 00:23:23.458
Alright, alright.

441
00:23:27.277 --> 00:23:29.485
Sorry. I can't help.

442
00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:38.416
Here he is.

443
00:23:39.927 --> 00:23:41.093
Are you really done, Bil?

444
00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:43.109
So we won't have to stop again.

445
00:23:43.973 --> 00:23:45.390
This is really bad.

446
00:23:46.477 --> 00:23:47.942
If Kubil isn't well yet...

447
00:23:48.541 --> 00:23:50.500
...let's find somewhere to stay
around here.

448
00:23:51.583 --> 00:23:52.233
What do you say?

449
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:54.583
- Okay.
- Okay.

450
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.608
Help me.

451
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:11.591
Okay.

452
00:24:13.261 --> 00:24:14.303
Let's go.

453
00:24:14.541 --> 00:24:15.583
Alright.

454
00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:20.129
Okay, thank you.

455
00:24:20.806 --> 00:24:22.515
Here, our room key.

456
00:24:24.594 --> 00:24:26.094
Does he even know where it is?

457
00:24:26.208 --> 00:24:28.083
I bet he wants
to go to the toilet.

458
00:24:28.738 --> 00:24:30.988
Here. I've booked you a room.

459
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:32.333
The three of us
will be in one room.

460
00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:33.892
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

461
00:24:33.916 --> 00:24:35.375
I'm gonna look for fresh air.

462
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:37.875
I don't want to be in the room,
with Kubil's smell.

463
00:24:38.554 --> 00:24:39.941
Okay, I'm going
to get some rest.

464
00:24:48.067 --> 00:24:50.067
What a nice ambiance.

465
00:24:52.513 --> 00:24:54.513
I just need a female
company here.

466
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.250
Can I ask for your help?

467
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:01.650
Miss, Let me know first
if you're going to talk.

468
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:03.108
Don't just talk suddenly.

469
00:25:03.583 --> 00:25:05.291
I want to ask for your help.

470
00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:10.567
What help do you need?

471
00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:13.041
Help me get home.

472
00:25:13.436 --> 00:25:17.270
Home is where the heart is.

473
00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:22.233
Where's your home?

474
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.150
Kelimutu.

475
00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:27.309
- I'd love to take you home.
- You promise?

476
00:25:27.333 --> 00:25:32.000
Yes. A man's promise
is the only thing he has.

477
00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:39.583
But I'm afraid my friends
will protest.

478
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.858
What should I do then?

479
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.666
We better have a nice chat...

480
00:25:46.916 --> 00:25:47.817
Miss?

481
00:25:48.083 --> 00:25:48.858
Oh dear.

482
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.525
Miss?

483
00:25:52.436 --> 00:25:53.811
So scary.

484
00:25:54.812 --> 00:25:55.937
Hey, what's wrong?

485
00:25:56.338 --> 00:25:57.234
Such a horror!

486
00:25:57.708 --> 00:25:59.458
A girl asked me
to take her home.

487
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.916
But when I turned,
she disappeared.

488
00:26:02.539 --> 00:26:04.622
I bet you were obscene,
that was why she left.

489
00:26:04.846 --> 00:26:07.471
I haven't done anything,
she just disappeared.

490
00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:08.983
Scary!

491
00:26:11.033 --> 00:26:13.533
Bil, have you stopped pooping?

492
00:26:14.207 --> 00:26:15.308
All good.

493
00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:16.483
I need to go to the toilet.

494
00:26:17.458 --> 00:26:19.392
Don't get sick again
while I'm inside.

495
00:26:19.482 --> 00:26:21.192
Yeah, yeah. Move.

496
00:26:26.846 --> 00:26:27.775
Oh dear.

497
00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:33.125
Oh no.

498
00:26:35.651 --> 00:26:37.609
Lay! Take turns!

499
00:26:37.958 --> 00:26:42.750
See? I was just in,
I told you just now.

500
00:26:43.356 --> 00:26:44.647
It's almost out.

501
00:26:44.833 --> 00:26:46.851
Be patient.
I'm not done yet.

502
00:26:46.875 --> 00:26:47.916
Hold it.

503
00:26:48.208 --> 00:26:49.559
How do I hold it?

504
00:26:49.583 --> 00:26:52.291
Find another toilet!
Stop bothering me!

505
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:54.083
Oh dear.

506
00:26:59.607 --> 00:27:00.941
Madam, Sir...

507
00:27:02.375 --> 00:27:03.625
...may I use your toilet?

508
00:27:11.616 --> 00:27:12.658
Madam...

509
00:27:22.274 --> 00:27:23.774
It's broken.

510
00:27:24.345 --> 00:27:25.428
Shitty hotel!

511
00:27:26.031 --> 00:27:28.156
And I have a big ass.

512
00:27:44.186 --> 00:27:46.311
Key? Is that you?

513
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.080
Ghost!

514
00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:11.750
Take me home!

515
00:28:13.333 --> 00:28:15.250
There's a ghost here!

516
00:28:16.041 --> 00:28:18.500
Ghost?
What are you talking about?

517
00:28:18.724 --> 00:28:19.700
You're a demon.

518
00:28:19.725 --> 00:28:21.541
I'm serious.
There's a ghost.

519
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.851
Let's just leave
and sleep in the van.

520
00:28:24.875 --> 00:28:25.976
What are you talking about?

521
00:28:26.033 --> 00:28:27.074
Ghost!

522
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.308
What is this?

523
00:28:32.333 --> 00:28:33.375
See?

524
00:28:33.666 --> 00:28:35.517
In...
In the ba...

525
00:28:35.687 --> 00:28:37.021
- Battlefield?
- No.

526
00:28:37.166 --> 00:28:39.142
- In the ba...
- Backwater?

527
00:28:39.166 --> 00:28:41.559
No.
There's a ghost in the bathroom.

528
00:28:41.741 --> 00:28:44.050
See? There was also a ghost
in our bathroom!

529
00:28:44.075 --> 00:28:46.392
Stop it!
You two are demons!

530
00:28:46.416 --> 00:28:47.767
Enough. I'm going to sleep.

531
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:50.041
Enough with this ghost nonsense.

532
00:29:05.547 --> 00:29:07.964
Key!

533
00:29:08.583 --> 00:29:12.767
Hey! What's with all this noise?
What's going on?

534
00:29:12.791 --> 00:29:14.625
There's a ghost.

535
00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:15.775
What ghost?

536
00:29:16.128 --> 00:29:17.461
A ghost in our room.

537
00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:19.442
- Let us sleep here.
- No.

538
00:29:20.041 --> 00:29:21.750
I don't want to sleep with you.

539
00:29:22.833 --> 00:29:24.767
- Leave.
- Key!

540
00:29:24.791 --> 00:29:27.083
Key!

541
00:29:28.958 --> 00:29:31.333
Take me home.

542
00:29:31.763 --> 00:29:34.596
Take me home.

543
00:29:42.333 --> 00:29:44.250
Ghost!

544
00:29:44.708 --> 00:29:45.958
- Ghost!
- See?

545
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.809
Take me home!

546
00:29:49.833 --> 00:29:53.976
Take me home!

547
00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.208
Take me home!

548
00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:03.601
A ghost won't come out
during the day, right?

549
00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:05.267
You shouldn't be flirtatious
with girls.

550
00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:07.750
- She doesn't follow us, right?
- I don't think so.

551
00:30:17.677 --> 00:30:18.885
Let's leave.

552
00:30:24.051 --> 00:30:26.093
Is she still there?

553
00:30:30.019 --> 00:30:31.025
She is.

554
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.517
This is your fault, Lay.

555
00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:34.518
Your doing again, Lay.

556
00:30:34.542 --> 00:30:35.958
It's always my fault.

557
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.708
Hey, what's wrong?
Something in your eyes?

558
00:30:40.583 --> 00:30:43.583
Those were Morse codes.
The General taught them to us.

559
00:30:44.311 --> 00:30:46.145
For us to send
messages in secret.

560
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.615
Why do you have to send messages
in secret?

561
00:30:50.083 --> 00:30:51.060
Ghost!

562
00:30:51.264 --> 00:30:53.107
Nobody sends secret messages.

563
00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.017
- Right?
- No one.

564
00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:55.333
I'm no ghost.

565
00:30:56.768 --> 00:30:58.393
I was human.

566
00:30:58.712 --> 00:31:00.462
I died in curiosity.

567
00:31:01.416 --> 00:31:03.750
And then I got a human employer.

568
00:31:06.375 --> 00:31:07.666
They look after me.

569
00:31:08.859 --> 00:31:10.859
No one asked that.

570
00:31:11.666 --> 00:31:13.833
My employer died in the hotel.

571
00:31:19.104 --> 00:31:21.437
That's why I have to go home.

572
00:31:27.693 --> 00:31:33.943
Hey, can you not move around
while you're talking?

573
00:32:08.185 --> 00:32:10.852
This is the gate to my house.

574
00:32:11.708 --> 00:32:12.233
Let's go in.

575
00:32:14.997 --> 00:32:16.080
It's huge.

576
00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:19.358
Met.

577
00:32:20.208 --> 00:32:21.250
It's dark.

578
00:32:21.916 --> 00:32:23.809
So scary.

579
00:32:23.833 --> 00:32:25.333
Why are you holding on to me?

580
00:32:28.227 --> 00:32:30.144
Agnes, is it still far?

581
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:32.291
Not far ahead.

582
00:32:33.375 --> 00:32:36.125
Not far ahead. Be patient.

583
00:32:36.708 --> 00:32:37.750
What are you doing?

584
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.041
I want to be here.

585
00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:42.083
No! I want to be here.

586
00:32:42.424 --> 00:32:43.525
I want to be in the middle.

587
00:32:43.583 --> 00:32:44.625
Shut up!

588
00:32:45.074 --> 00:32:46.283
I'm scared.

589
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:50.270
So scary.

590
00:32:54.742 --> 00:32:56.617
It's Freddy, my friend.

591
00:32:57.283 --> 00:32:58.449
His house is near.

592
00:32:59.353 --> 00:33:01.228
Never mind him.
Let's go on.

593
00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:03.191
Are you sure Freddy's fine?

594
00:33:07.796 --> 00:33:09.421
Nes, still a long way to go?

595
00:33:10.511 --> 00:33:11.678
It's near.

596
00:33:17.166 --> 00:33:18.208
What, Bil?

597
00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:20.083
Stop being scared!

598
00:33:20.958 --> 00:33:22.791
- There were hands.
- This is my position.

599
00:33:31.312 --> 00:33:32.496
Did you poke my butt?

600
00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:34.125
What? Not me!

601
00:33:34.791 --> 00:33:36.958
Not me! My hands were here.

602
00:33:37.642 --> 00:33:38.566
Maybe it was a tree branch.

603
00:33:50.234 --> 00:33:52.776
Hi, Granny.

604
00:33:57.026 --> 00:34:02.776
When we reach Granny's house,
it means we're close.

605
00:34:04.103 --> 00:34:06.728
- Let's go on.
- Hurry up.

606
00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:13.275
Let's go, Bil.

607
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.125
You think you're the only one
who is scared? Me too!

608
00:34:28.098 --> 00:34:28.817
Here.

609
00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:31.163
Is that your house?

610
00:34:34.387 --> 00:34:37.095
So, we've done our part, right?

611
00:34:38.833 --> 00:34:40.708
Stop following us around, okay?

612
00:34:41.283 --> 00:34:42.991
Okay. Thanks.

613
00:34:43.374 --> 00:34:45.141
Okay, then. Let's go.

614
00:34:45.205 --> 00:34:46.289
Hang on.

615
00:34:46.666 --> 00:34:48.666
- What else?
- Let's take a breather.

616
00:34:49.833 --> 00:34:50.875
Just one minute.

617
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:55.083
Mamet, don't you want to talk
to your grandfather?

618
00:34:55.985 --> 00:34:57.110
What do you mean by talk?

619
00:34:57.467 --> 00:34:59.192
It's him who
actually wants to talk.

620
00:34:59.958 --> 00:35:01.517
He wanted me
to send you a message.

621
00:35:01.741 --> 00:35:03.158
Where is The General?

622
00:35:03.767 --> 00:35:06.267
We're in the middle of the woods.
Don't joke around like that.

623
00:35:06.666 --> 00:35:07.708
I'm serious.

624
00:35:11.291 --> 00:35:13.083
It's him
who actually wants to talk.

625
00:35:14.159 --> 00:35:16.326
But he's unlike me yet.

626
00:35:16.889 --> 00:35:18.139
He's not curious yet.

627
00:35:18.375 --> 00:35:20.976
If you fail to take
him to his wife...

628
00:35:21.026 --> 00:35:22.901
...he might be the same as me.

629
00:35:23.291 --> 00:35:25.108
How do you know
we're taking him to his wife?

630
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:27.708
I talked to him
a lot in the car.

631
00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.567
- You want to talk to him?
- What if I don't want to?

632
00:35:32.666 --> 00:35:34.416
He said you have to agree.

633
00:35:37.375 --> 00:35:39.750
Key, let me borrow your body.

634
00:35:42.125 --> 00:35:42.733
Key?

635
00:35:43.202 --> 00:35:43.956
What's wrong with Key?

636
00:35:45.932 --> 00:35:47.724
- Mangku Boys.
- Yes, General!

637
00:35:51.083 --> 00:35:54.517
Bil, my feet can't move.

638
00:35:54.542 --> 00:35:57.126
Bolay, Kubil, follow me.

639
00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.358
Yes, General!

640
00:36:08.805 --> 00:36:11.055
Lay, Bil.

641
00:36:12.108 --> 00:36:13.892
Come here. Don't be lazy.

642
00:36:13.916 --> 00:36:15.166
- Yes, General!
- Yes, General!

643
00:36:21.249 --> 00:36:23.016
It's easy for you because
you don't have to breathe.

644
00:36:23.199 --> 00:36:24.358
You don't need
to catch your breath.

645
00:36:25.333 --> 00:36:27.833
It's different for us.

646
00:36:31.743 --> 00:36:33.535
- Lay.
- Yes, General.

647
00:36:34.621 --> 00:36:36.538
When I see you now...

648
00:36:37.721 --> 00:36:39.359
...it reminds me
of me back then.

649
00:36:41.045 --> 00:36:43.170
I was...

650
00:36:46.857 --> 00:36:49.857
...a soldier,
I was manly.

651
00:36:51.138 --> 00:36:52.846
In and out of villages.

652
00:36:54.192 --> 00:36:55.901
I met village girls.

653
00:36:57.061 --> 00:36:58.395
Ready to be my girlfriends.

654
00:37:01.734 --> 00:37:02.525
Well...

655
00:37:06.054 --> 00:37:08.763
It was fun in the beginning.

656
00:37:09.083 --> 00:37:09.817
Fun.

657
00:37:11.583 --> 00:37:12.400
But...

658
00:37:13.583 --> 00:37:17.625
...one day you need
to harbor your heart.

659
00:37:18.875 --> 00:37:21.041
You can't keep on doing that.

660
00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:28.458
Stop it.
What else are you looking for?

661
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.166
Find one woman
to accompany you...

662
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.916
...in your last moments
in this world.

663
00:37:40.769 --> 00:37:42.060
Don't be like me.

664
00:37:43.462 --> 00:37:46.754
Regretting the past.

665
00:37:47.873 --> 00:37:48.565
Got it?

666
00:37:49.916 --> 00:37:50.958
Yes, General.

667
00:37:52.665 --> 00:37:54.575
- Bil.
- Yes, General.

668
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.275
My apoligies.

669
00:37:58.583 --> 00:38:02.275
Don't be discouraged
for not being in the military.

670
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.375
And it's not your fault...

671
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.108
...that you're color blind.

672
00:38:10.026 --> 00:38:12.692
You're more of a soldier...

673
00:38:13.422 --> 00:38:15.797
...than many soldiers
that I know of.

674
00:38:17.004 --> 00:38:17.942
The important thing is...

675
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.041
...what you feel inside.

676
00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:22.192
Yes?

677
00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:27.208
Your mother
is proud of you already.

678
00:38:27.967 --> 00:38:29.717
Yes, General.
Permission to speak, General.

679
00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:31.896
How do you know that, General?

680
00:38:32.757 --> 00:38:33.798
I met her.

681
00:38:34.715 --> 00:38:36.923
She told me herself.
She said...

682
00:38:37.631 --> 00:38:39.464
...whatever profession
you have...

683
00:38:41.041 --> 00:38:45.750
...she will support you
and pray for you.

684
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:49.083
From up there.

685
00:38:50.786 --> 00:38:53.911
Yes, General.
Send her my love.

686
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.108
Yes.

687
00:38:57.277 --> 00:38:58.094
Now...

688
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:02.802
...I just need
to talk to Mamet.

689
00:39:06.583 --> 00:39:08.166
My grandson...

690
00:39:09.916 --> 00:39:12.000
...isn't as strong as you.

691
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.247
He had lost a lot.

692
00:39:18.304 --> 00:39:21.179
His parents.

693
00:39:21.756 --> 00:39:22.983
And now, me.

694
00:39:25.375 --> 00:39:27.692
You're the only ones he has.

695
00:39:30.541 --> 00:39:33.291
Don't let him lose you, okay?

696
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.415
Take care of him, Lay, Bil.

697
00:39:37.929 --> 00:39:39.608
Yes, General. Will do.

698
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:41.817
Okay.

699
00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.774
Take me to Bia...

700
00:39:46.125 --> 00:39:48.375
...so I can rest in peace.

701
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:49.692
Of course, General.

702
00:39:51.541 --> 00:39:53.250
We will always
remember your message.

703
00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:58.916
Forgive me, General,
if I made mistakes.

704
00:40:01.346 --> 00:40:03.346
Thank you for all you've done.

705
00:40:03.625 --> 00:40:04.666
Thank you, General.

706
00:40:05.875 --> 00:40:06.567
Thank you.

707
00:40:07.625 --> 00:40:10.458
Hey! What are you doing?

708
00:40:11.745 --> 00:40:13.015
How dare you!

709
00:40:13.208 --> 00:40:13.900
Watch out!

710
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:22.600
Disgusting.

711
00:40:23.221 --> 00:40:24.638
- Key!
- Hey!

712
00:40:24.833 --> 00:40:25.650
It's not like that, Key.

713
00:40:26.666 --> 00:40:28.500
You were possessed
by The General.

714
00:40:30.276 --> 00:40:31.317
Why would I lie?

715
00:40:32.138 --> 00:40:34.346
If you don't believe me,
just ask Kubil.

716
00:40:35.554 --> 00:40:36.234
I'm honest, right, Bil?

717
00:40:36.866 --> 00:40:37.908
He's honest.

718
00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:41.041
- Met?
- I don't know. I passed out.

719
00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:45.434
Never mind.
Let's go back to the van now.

720
00:40:45.458 --> 00:40:47.208
- We're going back to Ende.
- Hang on.

721
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:48.983
Look.

722
00:40:49.666 --> 00:40:51.500
The GPS told us
to go through Larantuka.

723
00:40:52.109 --> 00:40:53.651
Going through Ende means
we're going around.

724
00:40:54.458 --> 00:40:56.101
Just go through Larantuka.

725
00:40:56.165 --> 00:40:58.123
We have agreed
to go through Ende, right?

726
00:40:58.333 --> 00:40:58.900
Right.

727
00:40:59.582 --> 00:41:01.100
But if it's closer
through Larantuka...

728
00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:02.226
...we better go through it.

729
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.517
We have to ride a boat
to Ende, right?

730
00:41:03.541 --> 00:41:06.267
We have to wait. Too long.
Just go through Larantuka.

731
00:41:06.291 --> 00:41:08.101
The General's original plan
was through Larantuka.

732
00:41:08.144 --> 00:41:11.144
The ones who agree through
Larantuka, raise your hands.

733
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:16.270
Whatever you want.

734
00:41:22.986 --> 00:41:25.569
What else do you want?
We took you home already.

735
00:41:26.471 --> 00:41:28.221
I owe you.

736
00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:31.583
If you need my help someday...

737
00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:32.862
...just call me.

738
00:41:33.166 --> 00:41:36.208
If we're not separated by water,
I will come.

739
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.166
And you won't need
to take me home.

740
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.525
Because I can go by myself now.

741
00:41:42.791 --> 00:41:44.809
Thank you.

742
00:41:44.833 --> 00:41:45.934
Let's go.

743
00:41:45.958 --> 00:41:48.500
- Excuse me.
- Have a peaceful rest.

744
00:42:05.526 --> 00:42:06.567
I've put in the order.

745
00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:09.958
- While we wait, we'll swim.
- Okay, let's go.

746
00:42:13.366 --> 00:42:14.234
You're not going to swim?

747
00:42:14.651 --> 00:42:16.192
No. I don't want to tan my skin.

748
00:42:17.317 --> 00:42:18.275
You suck.

749
00:42:20.375 --> 00:42:22.083
Why are you scared
of being tanned?

750
00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:24.166
It's sexy.

751
00:42:24.458 --> 00:42:26.541
I'm also scared of sharks too.

752
00:42:27.833 --> 00:42:29.875
No sharks here on this beach.

753
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:31.416
But we have a crocodile there.

754
00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:34.166
That suits him.

755
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:35.791
Watch out.

756
00:42:39.375 --> 00:42:40.833
I wish I was taking Yayuk here.

757
00:42:41.553 --> 00:42:42.900
I'll go back here
for my honeymoon.

758
00:42:44.158 --> 00:42:46.574
Yayuk? Your girlfriend?

759
00:42:46.943 --> 00:42:48.693
My future wife.

760
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:52.691
Look here. Beautiful, isn't she?

761
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.875
This is my love.
My future wife.

762
00:42:58.589 --> 00:43:00.422
- Let me see.
- Pretty, isn't she?

763
00:43:01.012 --> 00:43:03.720
Oh dear. She wears
such thick makeup here.

764
00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:07.101
Was she going to a party
in this photo?

765
00:43:07.125 --> 00:43:09.708
No. She's that pretty every day.

766
00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.928
Oh, she goes to a party
every day.

767
00:43:14.234 --> 00:43:16.776
No. She's even beautiful
when she goes to a party.

768
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.060
It's unusual for Bolay
to message me.

769
00:43:36.346 --> 00:43:38.179
Mamet!

770
00:43:39.666 --> 00:43:41.309
You!

771
00:43:41.333 --> 00:43:45.250
Mamet!

772
00:43:49.969 --> 00:43:53.303
Pick your life partner wisely.

773
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:55.442
Don't be like me.

774
00:43:57.618 --> 00:44:00.858
I only found out later that my
then-husband had a bad profession.

775
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.625
What was his profession?

776
00:44:03.291 --> 00:44:04.750
I cannot tell you.

777
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.642
But I didn't like his job.

778
00:44:08.706 --> 00:44:10.165
Jon, beat him?

779
00:44:10.416 --> 00:44:11.458
Come on.

780
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.541
There are still people.
Be patient. Not the time yet.

781
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.291
- Yes, Boss.
- Yes, Boss.

782
00:44:16.685 --> 00:44:20.727
I asked him to find another job,
but he was angry.

783
00:44:21.644 --> 00:44:23.935
He hit me. He cursed at me.

784
00:44:27.032 --> 00:44:29.157
Although it's easy
to make him scared.

785
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:32.974
How?

786
00:44:33.708 --> 00:44:35.041
Just show him a cockroach.

787
00:44:35.685 --> 00:44:36.810
He must be scared.

788
00:44:39.894 --> 00:44:41.102
So why didn't you do it?

789
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:42.791
Hey, Key!

790
00:44:43.402 --> 00:44:46.277
I found a starfish!
Nice!

791
00:44:47.187 --> 00:44:48.229
Come here.

792
00:44:49.708 --> 00:44:52.101
Hey! No...

793
00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:53.375
That's a sea urchin!

794
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:55.976
- Sea urchin?
- Throw it away!

795
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.458
- Throw it away!
- Help! Be patient, Bil.

796
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:04.726
Throw it away!

797
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:08.625
- Lay down.
- Be patient, Bil.

798
00:45:09.083 --> 00:45:10.375
Help!

799
00:45:11.671 --> 00:45:13.004
- Key, help him.
- What should we do?

800
00:45:13.875 --> 00:45:17.392
- Hit him with something.
- What thing?

801
00:45:17.416 --> 00:45:19.291
- With our feet.
- Yes.

802
00:45:21.271 --> 00:45:23.271
Enough. It hurts.

803
00:45:24.458 --> 00:45:25.666
- That's it?
- That's it?

804
00:45:26.875 --> 00:45:28.351
Pee on him...

805
00:45:28.375 --> 00:45:29.708
- No way!
- ...to neutralize the toxin.

806
00:45:30.208 --> 00:45:31.375
Let's pee on him.

807
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:33.125
- Be patient, Bil.
- Be patient, Bil!

808
00:45:37.625 --> 00:45:39.642
- Stinky!
- Oh no!

809
00:45:39.666 --> 00:45:42.666
- It got to my feet.
- The wind blows hard.

810
00:45:45.942 --> 00:45:47.776
- I don't have anymore.
- So stinky.

811
00:45:49.083 --> 00:45:51.916
- Key, what should we do?
- Help us.

812
00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:53.625
What should we do?

813
00:45:53.867 --> 00:45:54.600
Wait.

814
00:45:54.625 --> 00:45:57.125
Hurry, Key. Be patient, Bil.
Calm down.

815
00:45:58.353 --> 00:45:59.395
Help him.

816
00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:01.351
Which part
touched the sea urchin?

817
00:46:01.375 --> 00:46:03.333
His hand!

818
00:46:10.333 --> 00:46:13.000
- Is it healed yet?
- Wrong hand!

819
00:46:13.416 --> 00:46:14.517
Wrong hand.

820
00:46:14.541 --> 00:46:20.767
- Key, help Kubil.
- For Kubil.

821
00:46:20.791 --> 00:46:21.833
Okay.

822
00:46:22.041 --> 00:46:25.541
- Be patient.
- Be patient.

823
00:46:26.171 --> 00:46:27.421
Hurry up, Key!

824
00:46:27.875 --> 00:46:29.000
In a second.

825
00:46:29.875 --> 00:46:30.916
Here.

826
00:46:31.083 --> 00:46:32.726
Whoa!

827
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:33.851
Don't comment.

828
00:46:33.875 --> 00:46:35.375
Quick, open it.

829
00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:37.976
- Bil, be patient.
- Hang on.

830
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.375
Hang on.

831
00:46:39.666 --> 00:46:41.125
Hang on.

832
00:46:42.125 --> 00:46:43.166
Nice.

833
00:46:52.381 --> 00:46:54.672
Quick, it's late.

834
00:46:55.174 --> 00:46:56.650
Why did you hold
a sea urchin anyway?

835
00:46:56.708 --> 00:46:57.692
That's what happens.

836
00:47:00.458 --> 00:47:03.416
I told you
you can't run from me.

837
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.309
- Oh no.
- Hey! Who are you?

838
00:47:06.333 --> 00:47:08.601
Don't interfere.
Go into the van.

839
00:47:08.645 --> 00:47:10.936
Hey! Don't mess with them.

840
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.916
You don't mess with us.

841
00:47:16.041 --> 00:47:17.238
- Take care of them.
- Yes, Boss.

842
00:47:20.797 --> 00:47:22.089
Key, honey, come on.

843
00:47:30.048 --> 00:47:30.859
What should we do?

844
00:47:31.772 --> 00:47:33.316
The General's body
will take too long to bury.

845
00:47:34.076 --> 00:47:38.191
He can be a curious spirit
like Agnes.

846
00:47:42.922 --> 00:47:44.650
What if we ask for Agnes's help?

847
00:47:45.625 --> 00:47:47.000
Did you call me?

848
00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:50.375
Shut up!

849
00:48:00.125 --> 00:48:01.250
Nes?

850
00:48:01.929 --> 00:48:04.388
Nes?

851
00:48:11.449 --> 00:48:14.741
Nes, help us.
But don't scare us.

852
00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.166
What, Met?

853
00:48:18.541 --> 00:48:20.250
I told you not to scare us.

854
00:48:22.011 --> 00:48:24.594
So, what's your idea?

855
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:28.458
I don't know.
But we want your help.

856
00:48:29.208 --> 00:48:31.101
Right, find an idea, Nes.

857
00:48:31.126 --> 00:48:33.025
Right, Nes.
It's up to you.

858
00:48:33.291 --> 00:48:34.608
But free us from our bind first.

859
00:48:48.708 --> 00:48:51.916
Why are you touching
my genitalia?

860
00:48:57.916 --> 00:49:00.457
Why are you touching
my genitalia?

861
00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:03.291
What's wrong with you two?

862
00:49:04.887 --> 00:49:08.096
Why are you touching it again?

863
00:49:10.479 --> 00:49:12.562
You're touching it again!

864
00:49:15.541 --> 00:49:17.250
You're crushing mine!

865
00:49:20.541 --> 00:49:22.500
Let's go.

866
00:49:26.708 --> 00:49:28.000
Oh dear, Boss.

867
00:49:33.625 --> 00:49:34.708
It hurts, Boss!

868
00:49:36.375 --> 00:49:37.809
Let's just go through Larantuka.

869
00:49:37.833 --> 00:49:38.916
Yes, Key. Hurry.

870
00:49:43.166 --> 00:49:45.166
Cockroach!

871
00:49:45.644 --> 00:49:47.810
Cockroach!

872
00:49:55.847 --> 00:50:00.184
Bye, Agnes! Thank you!
Take care!

873
00:50:00.208 --> 00:50:02.559
Have a long life.
Bye!

874
00:50:02.623 --> 00:50:04.623
Bye!

875
00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:07.333
It's Agnes, not us.

876
00:50:09.833 --> 00:50:11.166
It was crazy!

877
00:50:12.408 --> 00:50:13.949
They were squeezing genitalias!

878
00:50:14.875 --> 00:50:16.125
They were crushed.

879
00:50:17.875 --> 00:50:20.934
Agnes played them hard.
You're cool for that idea.

880
00:50:20.958 --> 00:50:23.958
It's because Kubil was talking
about The General's body.

881
00:50:24.164 --> 00:50:25.998
Met, your phone.

882
00:50:26.344 --> 00:50:28.303
Right. Thanks, Key.

883
00:50:29.131 --> 00:50:31.422
Hang on, I'm going to charge it.
No battery.

884
00:50:31.791 --> 00:50:33.101
Love slave.

885
00:50:33.125 --> 00:50:34.666
You're just envy,
you single guys.

886
00:50:39.823 --> 00:50:41.407
Let's just make a video.

887
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.982
You just don't
stop making videos.

888
00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:55.500
56 missed calls?

889
00:50:56.331 --> 00:50:57.373
I'm dead.

890
00:51:02.985 --> 00:51:04.775
Sorry, honey.
I didn't realize you called.

891
00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:08.166
Where have you been?
I've been calling you.

892
00:51:09.165 --> 00:51:11.858
My phone fell in the car.
And then battery dead.

893
00:51:12.207 --> 00:51:14.808
And we were captivated
by three thugs.

894
00:51:14.833 --> 00:51:16.434
It was so scary.

895
00:51:16.459 --> 00:51:19.001
Lies! You cheater!

896
00:51:19.179 --> 00:51:22.429
What?
What's with this accusation?

897
00:51:22.708 --> 00:51:24.567
You're still making excuses?

898
00:51:25.701 --> 00:51:27.951
I want us to break up.

899
00:51:28.625 --> 00:51:30.317
Our engagement
and our marriage is off.

900
00:51:30.583 --> 00:51:33.025
What? Honey,
why are you suddenly like this?

901
00:51:33.166 --> 00:51:34.650
I have the proof, Met.

902
00:51:35.083 --> 00:51:36.476
Just see it yourself
in my message.

903
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.400
Don't make excuses anymore.

904
00:51:38.026 --> 00:51:39.067
Honey?

905
00:51:42.416 --> 00:51:43.601
What is this?

906
00:51:43.625 --> 00:51:45.726
HOW COULD YOU?

907
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:46.791
Wait.

908
00:51:47.685 --> 00:51:48.727
But this is...

909
00:51:53.269 --> 00:51:54.108
Hey, you bastard!

910
00:51:54.708 --> 00:51:56.333
You sent a photo
to my girlfriend, didn't you?

911
00:51:58.656 --> 00:52:00.781
Hey, this photo...

912
00:52:02.416 --> 00:52:04.642
Calm down.
Let me explain it to her.

913
00:52:04.666 --> 00:52:05.942
I'm only joking.

914
00:52:06.207 --> 00:52:08.808
You only make trouble.
You're a useless friend!

915
00:52:08.833 --> 00:52:10.000
Calm down.

916
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:11.525
Don't you know what you did?

917
00:52:11.875 --> 00:52:13.666
She broke up with me
because of you!

918
00:52:14.396 --> 00:52:16.896
I know, Met.
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

919
00:52:17.166 --> 00:52:19.392
And now I'm not gonna
get married. You bastard!

920
00:52:19.416 --> 00:52:21.000
Calm down, Met.

921
00:52:22.432 --> 00:52:23.515
Calm down.

922
00:52:23.916 --> 00:52:25.442
Met, sorry!

923
00:52:25.583 --> 00:52:27.567
Hold up.

924
00:52:27.728 --> 00:52:28.692
Let me talk to him.

925
00:52:39.566 --> 00:52:40.504
Calm down.

926
00:52:41.631 --> 00:52:42.922
I have no calmness left.

927
00:52:43.958 --> 00:52:45.583
His joke broke us up.

928
00:52:46.919 --> 00:52:48.169
I was going to get married.

929
00:52:49.359 --> 00:52:50.776
I was just talking to Key.

930
00:52:51.783 --> 00:52:53.033
I didn't do anything.

931
00:52:53.563 --> 00:52:56.101
You didn't do anything.
You were gonna get married.

932
00:52:56.125 --> 00:52:57.192
You have to calm down.

933
00:53:01.208 --> 00:53:02.833
Empty, Boss!
Maybe they're there!

934
00:53:10.374 --> 00:53:13.600
Met! I know you're still mad.
But...

935
00:53:13.625 --> 00:53:17.541
- Hide! Andre is here.
- Come on! Quick!

936
00:53:17.915 --> 00:53:19.475
Bastards! Get them!

937
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:20.541
Okay, Boss!

938
00:53:20.916 --> 00:53:23.375
Hey! Thieves!

939
00:53:24.132 --> 00:53:25.174
Quick!

940
00:53:27.165 --> 00:53:29.516
Bastard! Thieves!

941
00:53:29.567 --> 00:53:30.942
Hurry!

942
00:53:31.578 --> 00:53:32.619
Here!

943
00:53:37.791 --> 00:53:39.500
We give up.

944
00:53:43.592 --> 00:53:44.902
- Bring them here.
- We give up.

945
00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.271
Quick!

946
00:54:07.666 --> 00:54:09.583
Lay, call Agnes again.

947
00:54:11.783 --> 00:54:12.525
We can't.

948
00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:15.400
We're on the waters.

949
00:54:16.969 --> 00:54:20.678
We can't call her
if we had left the land.

950
00:54:21.047 --> 00:54:22.567
Try using your dark magic again.

951
00:54:23.541 --> 00:54:26.184
- I'll shoot you!
- Don't.

952
00:54:26.208 --> 00:54:27.567
You don't need to use a gun.

953
00:54:28.013 --> 00:54:29.638
We're not gonna use any magic.

954
00:54:34.208 --> 00:54:36.750
I heard you're going to go
to Timor Leste...

955
00:54:37.291 --> 00:54:38.541
...to take that coffin.

956
00:54:39.416 --> 00:54:39.942
We are.

957
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:41.833
That's right.

958
00:54:42.208 --> 00:54:45.666
We're going there together then.

959
00:54:46.234 --> 00:54:47.150
Are you crazy?

960
00:54:50.533 --> 00:54:51.775
Certainly.

961
00:54:54.083 --> 00:54:55.900
That's why you like me, right?

962
00:55:01.166 --> 00:55:03.708
- Jon, ready our things.
- Yes, Boss.

963
00:55:17.458 --> 00:55:17.983
Andre.

964
00:55:20.675 --> 00:55:22.316
You can't get through
immigration.

965
00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:24.976
You'll get arrested.

966
00:55:25.059 --> 00:55:26.709
It's my business
as long as we can pass.

967
00:55:27.239 --> 00:55:29.515
If anyone tries anything funny,
we'll kill them all!

968
00:55:36.504 --> 00:55:38.212
What should we do?

969
00:55:38.937 --> 00:55:41.233
Crying for help?

970
00:55:42.041 --> 00:55:42.525
Idiot.

971
00:55:43.042 --> 00:55:45.083
We'll be shot to death.

972
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:46.851
The guards are military.

973
00:55:46.875 --> 00:55:48.142
They'll understand Morse code.

974
00:55:48.166 --> 00:55:50.017
Let's send SOS with Morse code.

975
00:55:50.041 --> 00:55:51.067
SOS looks good.

976
00:55:51.369 --> 00:55:53.203
Hey! Why are you
blinking non-stop?

977
00:55:55.136 --> 00:55:57.053
Nothing. I'm...

978
00:55:57.497 --> 00:55:58.539
My eyes are itchy.

979
00:55:59.166 --> 00:56:01.517
Something gets in my eyes.
May I rub them?

980
00:56:01.541 --> 00:56:03.025
Please do.
Your hands aren't tied.

981
00:56:04.449 --> 00:56:06.858
Oh, right. Thanks, Boss.

982
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:26.992
Lamber, let's do karaoke.

983
00:56:27.263 --> 00:56:28.763
Okay, Boss!

984
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:31.625
This is fun. Let's do it!
What song will we sing?

985
00:56:32.333 --> 00:56:33.400
Let me look.

986
00:56:33.625 --> 00:56:34.809
Ah, this one.

987
00:56:34.833 --> 00:56:36.541
- Great!
- Great, Boss!

988
00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:42.831
This is great.

989
00:58:10.276 --> 00:58:11.609
Who told you to sing?

990
00:58:12.166 --> 00:58:13.833
- No one.
- I'll shoot you.

991
00:58:14.416 --> 00:58:16.476
- Forgive us.
- And you were dancing too.

992
00:58:16.653 --> 00:58:18.525
Hide your teeth.
Don't smile.

993
00:58:19.317 --> 00:58:20.400
I'll take your teeth out.

994
00:58:21.291 --> 00:58:24.041
You said you love me?
Drive the car then.

995
00:59:08.256 --> 00:59:13.089
WINI BORDER POST.

996
00:59:19.125 --> 00:59:20.726
We do it as planned.

997
00:59:20.751 --> 00:59:21.894
Yes, Boss.

998
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.852
- Lamber, watch them.
- Yes, Boss.

999
00:59:23.877 --> 00:59:25.233
Remember, hide your weapons.

1000
00:59:25.844 --> 00:59:27.078
If anyone tries
anything funny...

1001
00:59:28.291 --> 00:59:29.817
...I'll put a hole in your head.

1002
00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:44.161
- Good afternoon, Sir.
- Good afternoon, Ma'am.

1003
00:59:54.638 --> 00:59:56.304
Don't try anything funny.

1004
01:00:04.187 --> 01:00:05.288
Faster.

1005
01:00:05.313 --> 01:00:06.480
So slow.

1006
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.559
Faster.

1007
01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:09.625
Faster.

1008
01:00:24.247 --> 01:00:26.247
Faster.

1009
01:00:42.144 --> 01:00:43.227
Key, what's going on?

1010
01:00:44.333 --> 01:00:46.059
I don't know
why the van won't start.

1011
01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:47.142
Don't try anything funny.

1012
01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:49.166
S.O.S! S.O.S! S.O.S!

1013
01:00:50.464 --> 01:00:53.464
S.O.S! S.O.S! S.O.S!

1014
01:01:00.375 --> 01:01:02.708
Good afternoon, Sir.
Can you open the middle door?

1015
01:01:03.768 --> 01:01:06.952
What for? We've checked
everything there. All good.

1016
01:01:06.983 --> 01:01:09.650
This is only a formality,
for data checking.

1017
01:01:10.043 --> 01:01:11.561
Can you open the middle door?

1018
01:01:11.586 --> 01:01:13.383
But...

1019
01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:19.208
Whose dead body is this?

1020
01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:20.985
My grandfather's.

1021
01:01:21.063 --> 01:01:22.271
Who's the real grandson?

1022
01:01:22.761 --> 01:01:23.636
Me.

1023
01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:25.150
Can you get out of
the van for a while?

1024
01:01:29.395 --> 01:01:31.103
Sir, why are you taking him?

1025
01:01:32.053 --> 01:01:33.303
Sir!

1026
01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:34.775
Shut up!

1027
01:01:38.541 --> 01:01:40.017
Don't mess with me.

1028
01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:41.125
I know.

1029
01:01:49.219 --> 01:01:51.817
Why did you and the other guy
send an SOS signal?

1030
01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:55.317
Oh dear!
I thought you didn't notice!

1031
01:01:57.332 --> 01:02:00.475
So, some people in the car
were forcing themselves...

1032
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.942
...to join us
going into Timor Leste.

1033
01:02:02.458 --> 01:02:05.483
And I think they're going into
Timor Leste to meet criminals.

1034
01:02:05.708 --> 01:02:07.416
We were threatened.

1035
01:02:07.707 --> 01:02:10.766
Okay, we have to find a way
to get them out of the car...

1036
01:02:10.791 --> 01:02:12.025
...and find their weaknesses.

1037
01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:14.671
Weakness, huh?

1038
01:02:19.914 --> 01:02:21.900
All good.

1039
01:02:27.046 --> 01:02:28.504
- All good?
- All good.

1040
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.767
They're so nice.
See? They gave us food.

1041
01:02:31.823 --> 01:02:34.633
Because they know
the deceased was a soldier.

1042
01:02:34.658 --> 01:02:36.283
Here, just take it.

1043
01:02:43.505 --> 01:02:44.859
How can it start so easily?

1044
01:02:59.958 --> 01:03:01.208
Cockroaches!

1045
01:03:03.708 --> 01:03:04.958
Open the door!

1046
01:03:16.541 --> 01:03:17.875
Key! Are you scared of them too?

1047
01:03:38.125 --> 01:03:39.416
Stop! Don't make a fuss!

1048
01:03:40.916 --> 01:03:42.351
Don't make a fuss at the border!

1049
01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:45.583
He's the bad guy!

1050
01:03:46.708 --> 01:03:47.916
Arrest the bad guys, Sir!

1051
01:03:48.798 --> 01:03:50.798
Arrest them!

1052
01:03:53.331 --> 01:03:54.956
You're finally arrested!
Eat that!

1053
01:03:55.506 --> 01:03:58.047
Bye!

1054
01:04:03.333 --> 01:04:04.708
Eat that, criminals!

1055
01:04:07.629 --> 01:04:09.421
General,
the mission is complete.

1056
01:04:10.378 --> 01:04:12.212
You've arrived
at the extraction point.

1057
01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:16.451
Be happy, General.

1058
01:04:17.616 --> 01:04:18.566
We'll see you again.

1059
01:04:19.676 --> 01:04:21.218
The report is completed.

1060
01:04:24.288 --> 01:04:25.330
Is this Kertolo?

1061
01:04:26.489 --> 01:04:27.864
That's right, Ma'am.

1062
01:04:28.276 --> 01:04:29.650
Forgive me, honey.

1063
01:04:31.427 --> 01:04:32.483
You must be Mamet.

1064
01:04:33.164 --> 01:04:35.525
You have your
grandfather's eyes.

1065
01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:39.000
Thank you, Ma'am.

1066
01:04:40.026 --> 01:04:41.733
May I ask you something?

1067
01:04:42.833 --> 01:04:43.400
You may.

1068
01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:46.817
Why did you stop replying
to The General's letters?

1069
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.400
I mean, my grandfather.

1070
01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:53.025
My father was furious
about our marriage.

1071
01:04:53.613 --> 01:04:56.358
I was forced to marry
another guy and went far away.

1072
01:04:57.374 --> 01:05:00.141
But not a day went by...

1073
01:05:00.166 --> 01:05:03.333
...without me missing
your grandfather.

1074
01:05:03.791 --> 01:05:06.858
I'm entrusting
my grandfather to you then.

1075
01:05:08.274 --> 01:05:13.774
Thank you
for bringing him to me.

1076
01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:14.775
You're welcome.

1077
01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:18.066
Are you finished?

1078
01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:24.791
This is my granddaughter,
Vinta Cika.

1079
01:05:25.579 --> 01:05:28.995
Vinta, what a gorgeous name.

1080
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:33.692
I'm Bolay, not that gorgeous,
but unpretentious.

1081
01:05:36.622 --> 01:05:38.872
May I know the meaning
of your name?

1082
01:05:39.429 --> 01:05:41.846
It is from a Portuguese word.

1083
01:05:43.125 --> 01:05:45.476
Vinta and Cika means 25.

1084
01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:46.976
She was born on the 25th.

1085
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.041
25?

1086
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.708
Your name means 25?

1087
01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:52.108
That's right. Why?

1088
01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:57.142
In the name of
the diplomatic relationship...

1089
01:05:57.166 --> 01:05:58.317
...between two countries...

1090
01:06:00.178 --> 01:06:02.594
...may I ask for
your phone number?

1091
01:06:12.337 --> 01:06:13.192
Thank you.

1092
01:06:14.456 --> 01:06:18.040
I'm leaving then. I'm going
to take my husband home.

1093
01:06:18.513 --> 01:06:21.554
Mamet, your grandfather
must've been proud of you.

1094
01:06:21.756 --> 01:06:22.525
Thank you.

1095
01:06:23.652 --> 01:06:24.567
You're welcome.

1096
01:06:30.915 --> 01:06:31.585
Met...

1097
01:06:32.567 --> 01:06:35.234
...I love you.

1098
01:06:36.234 --> 01:06:37.276
I love you so much.

1099
01:06:38.491 --> 01:06:39.783
Take good care of yourself.

1100
01:06:52.497 --> 01:06:53.408
Bye, Grandfather.

1101
01:06:54.366 --> 01:06:56.233
Send my love to my
parents over there.

1102
01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:27.309
New girlfriend?

1103
01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:29.650
Yes, it's Vinta!

1104
01:07:32.395 --> 01:07:34.400
Should I stay here?

1105
01:07:34.853 --> 01:07:39.061
Don't fall in love so fast.

1106
01:07:40.833 --> 01:07:44.108
Go home.
Later, you can come any time.

1107
01:07:45.775 --> 01:07:47.233
- Okay!
- Let's go.

1108
01:07:53.691 --> 01:07:55.982
- Let's get into the car?
- Sure.

1109
01:07:57.125 --> 01:07:58.067
New badge?

1110
01:07:58.889 --> 01:08:02.906
I got this Ary badge from Mr. Harman.

1111
01:08:03.767 --> 01:08:05.817
That's good, handsome.

1112
01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:08.482
- Let's get in?
- Sure.

1113
01:08:17.214 --> 01:08:17.650
Met.

1114
01:08:23.074 --> 01:08:24.824
Yayuk asked me to call her.

1115
01:08:26.458 --> 01:08:26.983
And?

1116
01:08:27.901 --> 01:08:29.609
Well, I'm scared.

1117
01:08:30.833 --> 01:08:31.650
What are you scared of?

1118
01:08:33.388 --> 01:08:35.679
I'm scared that...
What am I scared of?

1119
01:08:39.809 --> 01:08:40.975
That's your answer.

1120
01:08:41.935 --> 01:08:47.477
Met, you've been made scared
of her all this time...

1121
01:08:47.988 --> 01:08:52.067
...that you don't know
the reason anymore.

1122
01:08:53.622 --> 01:08:54.567
Met, imagine.

1123
01:08:55.375 --> 01:08:59.851
You've fought a criminal
like Andre and his guys...

1124
01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:02.083
...but you're still
scared of Yayuk?

1125
01:09:14.136 --> 01:09:16.511
Mamet, why are you
calling me just now?

1126
01:09:17.993 --> 01:09:20.094
- Here's the thing, honey...
- What?

1127
01:09:20.119 --> 01:09:22.452
- That...
- That what?

1128
01:09:23.041 --> 01:09:24.083
That...

1129
01:09:28.958 --> 01:09:29.358
Met?

1130
01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:31.025
Mamet?

1131
01:09:32.123 --> 01:09:32.690
Met?

1132
01:09:34.083 --> 01:09:35.125
Met...

1133
01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:38.875
Here's the thing.
We broke up.

1134
01:09:39.331 --> 01:09:41.373
So, what else do you want
from me?

1135
01:09:41.875 --> 01:09:43.650
You're the one who wanted
to break up.

1136
01:09:43.958 --> 01:09:46.567
But now you're mad
that I haven't called.

1137
01:09:46.856 --> 01:09:47.976
What do you want?

1138
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.416
Well, I...

1139
01:09:50.291 --> 01:09:52.458
I'm only... Well...

1140
01:09:52.803 --> 01:09:56.595
I'm only testing you, Met.

1141
01:09:57.875 --> 01:10:04.642
Why didn't you apologize?
You should've chased me.

1142
01:10:04.666 --> 01:10:07.875
Show me that you love me.

1143
01:10:08.179 --> 01:10:11.513
Sorry, but I have to take care
of my jewelry store.

1144
01:10:11.971 --> 01:10:16.763
I don't have time to handle
your perplexing conduct.

1145
01:10:17.048 --> 01:10:18.465
Met, hang on.

1146
01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:22.915
That means the jewelry store
is yours now.

1147
01:10:23.164 --> 01:10:25.455
- Bye!
- Mamet!

1148
01:10:25.875 --> 01:10:28.916
I miss you so much, you know.
Seriously.

1149
01:10:29.416 --> 01:10:31.642
I can't eat well.
I can't sleep well.

1150
01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:33.815
Everything doesn't feel good.
