00:00:28.917 --> 00:00:32.875
Once upon a time,

2
00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:38.333
there was a duel between Arjuna and Karna.

3
00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:56.000
<i>Events and outcomes in life are shaped</i>

4
00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:59.292
<i>by the choices and decisions we make.</i>

5
00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:02.167
<i>I was born to a wayang puppeteer.</i>

6
00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:12.500
<i>Since birth, my destiny has been decided.</i>

7
00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:17.417
<i>My ancestor came from the past
to determine my fate.</i>

8
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.208
Name your son

9
00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:25.417
I Made Budiawan.

10
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.458
Because he is

11
00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:35.708
the seventh heir.

12
00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:40.375
Inherited the skill of being

13
00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:45.000
a wayang puppeteer from our ancestors.

14
00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:48.250
And teach him the craft
of being a puppeteer.

15
00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:52.625
<i>They also have chosen who
I'm going to marry in the future.</i>

16
00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:54.833
<i>Her name is Putu.</i>

17
00:01:54.917 --> 00:01:58.125
<i>The daughter of a respected elder
in our village.</i>

18
00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:01.500
<i>But one day, this girl came to my village.</i>

19
00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.458
<i>Her name is Niluh.</i>

20
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.417
<i>She has Balinese and Japanese ancestry.</i>

21
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.667
Hello.

22
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.458
- Made.
- Niluh.

23
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.708
<i>Niluh is a unique person.</i>

24
00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:21.792
<i>She doesn't like to be controlled.</i>

25
00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:26.958
<i>She's a free spirit, like the starling,</i>

26
00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:30.875
<i>her favorite bird</i>
<i>that she named Mukudori</i>-chan.

27
00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:35.250
- Thank you, Mukudori<i>-chan.</i>
- Niluh, don't!

28
00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:39.000
Goodbye, Mukudori<i>-chan!</i>

29
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:47.000
- See you tomorrow!
- See you!

30
00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:02.833
Sorry for keeping you waiting!

31
00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:03.958
Order's up!

32
00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:06.417
For the guests at Table 12!

33
00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:15.458
Kids, don't run around.

34
00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:16.542
Be careful!

35
00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.958
<i>Niluh taught me new stuff,</i>

36
00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:26.875
<i>such as bothering her dad
in his sushi restaurant.</i>

37
00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:34.167
<i>Or dressing up in cosplay
where she would be the heroine,</i>

38
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.500
<i>and I would be the villain
who's afraid of heights.</i>

39
00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:48.708
Come on, scaredy-cat. Jump down here!

40
00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:49.875
But it's too high.

41
00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:51.917
Scaredy-cat.

42
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.708
- Jump down here!
- It's too high!

43
00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:55.500
Come on, jump down here!

44
00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:01.833
<i>Oh, and by the way,
she sewed the blue robe herself.</i>

45
00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:16.625
I'm stuck.

46
00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:22.083
No idea what to write for
the Japanese-influenced music.

47
00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:25.417
Need some Japanese music for reference?

48
00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.583
I have some Japanese records.

49
00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:31.625
- You can borrow them.
- Are you sure?

50
00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:34.583
- Can I?
- Of course.

51
00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:44.375
<i>Two-thirds of my life were spent with her.</i>

52
00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:47.292
<i>- She knew everything about me.</i>
- See you tomorrow?

53
00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:49.333
See you tomorrow!

54
00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:02.083
<i>Including my fear of riding in vehicles
because of this damn minibus.</i>

55
00:05:07.042 --> 00:05:07.958
Kadek.

56
00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:11.083
<i>That's why I now have to take
motion sickness medicine</i>

57
00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:15.250
<i>wherever I go so I can
sleep through the entire trip.</i>

58
00:05:16.042 --> 00:05:18.542
Tie him up.

59
00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:23.708
<i>And Niluh is the only one
with the patience</i>

60
00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:25.500
<i>to take me everywhere.</i>

61
00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:28.750
Hurry up!

62
00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:31.417
Hurry up!

63
00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:43.083
Turn right!

64
00:05:48.042 --> 00:05:49.750
<i>Even Kadek and Wayan,</i>

65
00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:53.583
<i>my so-called "best friends,"
wouldn't let me ride with them.</i>

66
00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:55.625
Did he take his motion sickness pill?

67
00:05:55.708 --> 00:05:56.792
I don't know.

68
00:05:56.875 --> 00:05:58.292
I think Niluh gave him one.

69
00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:01.208
It's good he trusts her to bring him.

70
00:06:01.292 --> 00:06:04.458
Or he'd be walking everywhere.

71
00:06:07.792 --> 00:06:10.167
<i>That's how close I am with Niluh.</i>

72
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.625
<i>So it's only natural for me
to be afraid of losing her.</i>

73
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.542
<i>It's been a few days</i>

74
00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:33.417
<i>Into the journey</i>

75
00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:38.875
Now he will.

76
00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:40.833
Do you want to try?

77
00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:42.333
- Yes, Dad.
- Here you go.

78
00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:50.958
<i>It's been a few days into the journey</i>

79
00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:02.208
I want to talk to you.

80
00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:09.208
Your grandmother's health
is declining fast.

81
00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:12.833
The doctor gave her

82
00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:14.917
one year.

83
00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:19.583
Your father wants us to
move to Japan temporarily.

84
00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:22.792
Must I go with you?

85
00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:25.125
Don't you want to be there
for your grandmother

86
00:07:26.042 --> 00:07:27.917
in her remaining time?

87
00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:32.167
Help me take care of your grandmother.

88
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.417
Your father is the only child she has.

89
00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:37.375
We are the only family she has.

90
00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:43.417
But I'm waiting for the acceptance letter
from Dewata University.

91
00:07:44.875 --> 00:07:46.375
You can study in Japan.

92
00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:49.042
There are many good universities in Tokyo.

93
00:07:53.167 --> 00:07:54.375
Let's do this.

94
00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:59.792
If Dewata University
approves your scholarship,

95
00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:02.000
we can have another conversation.

96
00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:09.333
But for the time being, we have to
make preparations to move to Japan.

97
00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:24.167
I know the timing is bad,
but the sooner the better.

98
00:08:26.458 --> 00:08:27.458
It's gonna be okay.

99
00:08:34.542 --> 00:08:35.542
Luh?

100
00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:37.458
Niluh?

101
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.833
Niluh!

102
00:08:58.417 --> 00:08:59.417
Niluh?

103
00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:01.708
Luh?

104
00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:05.042
Hey, what's wrong?

105
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
My parents and I are moving to Japan.

106
00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.750
My grandmother is gravely ill.

107
00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:30.125
What?

108
00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:34.125
But this is your hometown.

109
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.917
That's my hometown too.

110
00:09:39.375 --> 00:09:40.667
What about me?

111
00:09:42.667 --> 00:09:43.667
You are…

112
00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.542
You're gonna be okay.

113
00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:49.792
I mean, what about us?

114
00:09:51.542 --> 00:09:52.958
There is no "us."

115
00:09:55.042 --> 00:09:56.292
How can you say that?

116
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:59.875
But it's true.

117
00:10:02.542 --> 00:10:04.042
I thought we were friends.

118
00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:07.542
That doesn't mean
we can't still be friends.

119
00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:44.625
But it's not definitive.

120
00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:53.958
If Dewata University accepts
my application, I'll study here.

121
00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:58.083
But what if you're not accepted?

122
00:11:24.042 --> 00:11:25.875
I can't imagine…

123
00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:32.833
looking at your house…

124
00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:40.292
And not seeing you in the window.

125
00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:34.167
May you be blessed, ma'am.

126
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.542
May you be blessed too.

127
00:12:38.083 --> 00:12:39.000
How are you?

128
00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:40.917
We're fine, thank you.

129
00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:46.667
Here's a little gift from Semarang.

130
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.542
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

131
00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:50.375
Thank you.

132
00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:54.333
- May you be blessed.
- May you be blessed too.

133
00:12:54.417 --> 00:12:57.208
- You've become more beautiful.
- You're just saying that.

134
00:12:57.292 --> 00:12:59.875
- Please, come in.
- Let's go inside.

135
00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:06.125
Made, I heard you like making music.

136
00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:08.792
- Yes, I do.
- Is it done?

137
00:13:09.458 --> 00:13:10.625
Wanna to listen to it?

138
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.917
Do you still make content
for your social media?

139
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.292
Yeah. Actually, I just got a new gig.

140
00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:21.000
Creating a promo video and product photos.

141
00:13:21.083 --> 00:13:23.042
Great. How about we go to my studio?

142
00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:24.583
- Okay.
- Let's go.

143
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
What do you think?

144
00:13:37.792 --> 00:13:38.792
Do you like it?

145
00:13:39.417 --> 00:13:42.833
Maybe you can use it for the music score
in your content.

146
00:13:44.542 --> 00:13:46.500
But it's too grand for my liking.

147
00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.458
Can you make it more Japanese-style?

148
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.667
I thought the same thing too.

149
00:13:57.458 --> 00:14:01.542
I'll send you the song when it's ready.

150
00:14:16.042 --> 00:14:18.583
Can you come to the set
when we start filming?

151
00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:22.917
Of course, I'll be there.

152
00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:28.000
I won't let you be alone during filming.

153
00:14:33.083 --> 00:14:34.375
Thank you.

154
00:15:03.792 --> 00:15:05.292
Hey, Shiro!

155
00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:07.125
Hey!

156
00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:09.208
You startled me!

157
00:15:13.292 --> 00:15:17.417
Luh, you don't have
any plans tomorrow, right?

158
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.792
I don't? Sotoy!

159
00:15:20.875 --> 00:15:23.750
What? That's delicious. I love it!

160
00:15:23.833 --> 00:15:25.917
- You love what?
- Sotoy!

161
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.875
Chicken so toy, Goat so toy.
Especially the spicy one.

162
00:15:30.583 --> 00:15:32.333
You're silly!

163
00:15:32.417 --> 00:15:33.792
I'm serious.

164
00:15:33.875 --> 00:15:38.167
You should skip school
and go to the Kite Festival with me.

165
00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:42.000
To watch or to participate?

166
00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:43.375
To participate, of course.

167
00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:47.333
Who else is coming
and how will we get there?

168
00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:50.375
The usual.

169
00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:54.083
You, me, Kadek, Wayan.

170
00:15:55.333 --> 00:15:56.542
I'll ride the bike.

171
00:15:57.417 --> 00:15:59.333
You can go with Kadek and Wayan.

172
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.083
Okay, it's a deal.

173
00:16:07.792 --> 00:16:10.250
I'm going back to Jakarta
Want anything, babe?

174
00:16:13.792 --> 00:16:15.250
Putu is going to Jakarta.

175
00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:19.250
She asked if I want something.

176
00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:21.583
Any ideas?

177
00:16:23.125 --> 00:16:26.458
How should I know? How about the Monas?

178
00:16:28.833 --> 00:16:30.083
I'm not joking.

179
00:16:35.792 --> 00:16:37.792
She's going for a costume fitting.

180
00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:39.208
It's for the promo video.

181
00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:40.708
Cool, huh?

182
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.875
Beats me. Can you just leave?

183
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.500
Go home.

184
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:50.208
What did I do?

185
00:16:52.042 --> 00:16:53.042
I'm sleepy!

186
00:17:05.333 --> 00:17:06.333
Made!

187
00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:07.875
Luh!

188
00:17:09.167 --> 00:17:10.167
Made!

189
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Yes!

190
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.750
Niluh!

191
00:17:19.875 --> 00:17:21.875
- Careful.
- Yes.

192
00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.167
Don't forget the thread.

193
00:17:24.292 --> 00:17:25.500
- Here.
- Great.

194
00:17:29.417 --> 00:17:31.500
- Hey.
- Niluh!

195
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.750
It's already secured.

196
00:17:45.375 --> 00:17:48.458
Guys, I'm riding along with Made.

197
00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:50.125
Later.

198
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.417
- I envy him.
- Me too.

199
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.833
No, you're not.

200
00:17:55.917 --> 00:17:57.083
Let's go.

201
00:18:08.167 --> 00:18:09.792
You're not going with them?

202
00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:11.917
It's better with the bike.

203
00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.125
Okay.

204
00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:21.083
How is your music going?

205
00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:24.875
I don't know.

206
00:18:25.792 --> 00:18:26.792
Still blank.

207
00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:30.042
Here.

208
00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:36.917
I've been looking for this.

209
00:18:38.875 --> 00:18:40.917
- Thank you.
- Sure.

210
00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:43.375
I went to your house last night.

211
00:18:44.167 --> 00:18:45.583
I wanted to give it to you.

212
00:19:01.583 --> 00:19:02.917
Look at those.

213
00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:08.167
It's called a Jangan kite.

214
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.792
I think that one's a winner.

215
00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:13.333
The one on the left?

216
00:19:13.417 --> 00:19:15.833
I like the white
and red stripes over there.

217
00:19:17.375 --> 00:19:20.292
- May you be blessed.
- May you be blessed too.

218
00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:24.708
If you want to fly your kite, we provide
a less crowded site right there.

219
00:19:24.792 --> 00:19:25.792
If you don't mind.

220
00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:27.208
- Okay.
- Okay.

221
00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:29.083
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

222
00:19:39.375 --> 00:19:42.583
Kadek, you stay here
and hold the kite with him.

223
00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:44.500
I'll go help Niluh with the thread.

224
00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.958
- How about the other way around?
- No, it's okay.

225
00:19:47.042 --> 00:19:48.208
I really don't mind.

226
00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:52.667
That is exactly why you need to act fast.

227
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.917
Let's count to three
and pull the thread together, okay?

228
00:19:56.625 --> 00:20:00.208
One, two, three!

229
00:20:03.542 --> 00:20:04.542
We did it!

230
00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:46.625
- It's good, right?
- Yeah, I like it.

231
00:20:59.208 --> 00:21:01.625
Look, I think
Niluh's bike has a flat tire.

232
00:21:02.333 --> 00:21:03.333
Really?

233
00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:06.000
It does.

234
00:21:06.583 --> 00:21:08.250
We'll carry it on our wagon.

235
00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:16.750
Watch out for the wing.

236
00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:18.375
Hi!

237
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.417
I can't believe you're here too.

238
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.625
Are you here alone?

239
00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:29.417
- Hello, Putu!
- Hello, Putu!

240
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.208
No, with Kadek and Wayan too.

241
00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:33.583
Let's hang out.

242
00:21:38.667 --> 00:21:40.375
No, it's okay.

243
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.250
Are you sure?

244
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.625
- Yeah, you can go.
- Don't worry.

245
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:48.958
Shall we leave now?

246
00:21:49.042 --> 00:21:51.458
- How about Made?
- Don't ask me.

247
00:21:56.292 --> 00:21:58.917
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Of course.

248
00:22:02.292 --> 00:22:03.292
Let's go.

249
00:22:04.833 --> 00:22:06.333
There's a new café nearby.

250
00:22:06.417 --> 00:22:08.458
Why aren't we moving? I need a bath.

251
00:22:57.292 --> 00:22:59.917
- Can I have an autograph?
- Are you both dating?

252
00:23:03.083 --> 00:23:04.083
Is he your boyfriend?

253
00:23:07.667 --> 00:23:09.167
Thank you.

254
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.125
I'm sorry if they made you uncomfortable.

255
00:23:13.958 --> 00:23:15.833
I don't mind.

256
00:23:15.917 --> 00:23:18.292
I know who you are.

257
00:23:19.583 --> 00:23:20.583
Delicious?

258
00:23:24.583 --> 00:23:28.333
Can you go with me
to a product launch event tomorrow?

259
00:23:28.417 --> 00:23:29.417
Can you?

260
00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:32.500
Miss Putu, can I post the video?

261
00:23:32.583 --> 00:23:35.458
Who knows, maybe it'll go viral.

262
00:23:35.542 --> 00:23:36.542
Sure.

263
00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:40.292
Well, are you free tomorrow?

264
00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:43.125
Of course I'll go with you tomorrow.

265
00:23:43.208 --> 00:23:45.333
I want to be in a feature.

266
00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.167
Future?

267
00:23:48.042 --> 00:23:49.583
The movie.

268
00:23:50.667 --> 00:23:52.417
Do you mean, "feature"?

269
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.875
What do you think I said?

270
00:23:59.792 --> 00:24:02.958
Are you going to stay in Jakarta?

271
00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:04.542
Yes.

272
00:24:05.167 --> 00:24:07.667
You should study in Jakarta too.

273
00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:10.125
Can you?

274
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.875
It's not even five minutes,
I already got tons of likes.

275
00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:20.542
- Really?
- Look!

276
00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:24.000
- See?
- It went viral!

277
00:24:24.083 --> 00:24:25.167
De.

278
00:24:28.625 --> 00:24:30.042
What are you thinking about?

279
00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:37.292
If I stay in Jakarta,
my dad would do wayang shows alone.

280
00:24:38.583 --> 00:24:42.083
Doesn't he want his son
to have a brighter future?

281
00:24:45.208 --> 00:24:47.500
Do you think
my future is brighter in Jakarta?

282
00:24:49.375 --> 00:24:53.958
I mean, so what
if you want to study other things?

283
00:24:54.792 --> 00:24:58.250
Do you want to be stuck as a puppeteer?
You have lots of talents.

284
00:24:59.208 --> 00:25:01.625
You don't want to be controlled.

285
00:25:07.083 --> 00:25:09.833
My dad is also too traditional.

286
00:25:11.042 --> 00:25:14.750
To this day, his only activity
is making leather puppets.

287
00:25:16.292 --> 00:25:20.292
That doesn't mean I have to
follow his path as a puppet maker.

288
00:25:24.792 --> 00:25:28.208
You'll have a brighter future
if you come with me to Jakarta.

289
00:25:29.667 --> 00:25:30.667
Okay?

290
00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:14.000
CAUGHT SPOON-FEEDING EACH OTHER
AHHHH SO CUTE!

291
00:26:14.083 --> 00:26:18.792
I WANT TO BE SPOON-FED TOO
AS IF NOBODY WAS AROUND

292
00:26:44.542 --> 00:26:46.125
Hey, Shiro.

293
00:26:49.792 --> 00:26:51.083
Who is this from?

294
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.292
The chocolate is for you.

295
00:26:58.083 --> 00:27:00.042
But it's bitter.

296
00:27:00.125 --> 00:27:01.125
Why is that?

297
00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:04.333
Because you took
all the sweetness from it.

298
00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:09.875
Thanks.

299
00:27:20.542 --> 00:27:25.542
I want to apologize
for ditching you guys earlier.

300
00:27:26.958 --> 00:27:30.875
We went there together, but I left you.

301
00:27:32.958 --> 00:27:35.125
Don't worry.

302
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.167
She's your future wife.

303
00:27:37.792 --> 00:27:39.333
She's your priority.

304
00:27:58.458 --> 00:28:01.125
Aren't you tired of living here?

305
00:28:01.917 --> 00:28:03.417
Bali is a beautiful place.

306
00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:06.583
No, I love it here.

307
00:28:07.958 --> 00:28:09.292
Are you?

308
00:28:11.375 --> 00:28:12.375
Sometimes.

309
00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:15.917
And where do you want to go?

310
00:28:20.167 --> 00:28:22.542
Putu asked me to move to Jakarta with her.

311
00:28:25.792 --> 00:28:27.792
She wants to be in a movie.

312
00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:30.375
She owns a house.

313
00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:35.083
She said if we live together,

314
00:28:36.583 --> 00:28:38.458
we can pursue our careers together.

315
00:28:39.458 --> 00:28:41.125
What career do you have in mind?

316
00:28:41.208 --> 00:28:42.208
As an influencer?

317
00:28:43.125 --> 00:28:44.458
Or a TikToker?

318
00:28:45.125 --> 00:28:47.333
Do you want to create random content?

319
00:28:47.417 --> 00:28:48.792
Are you mocking me?

320
00:28:49.833 --> 00:28:51.167
Why are you so salty?

321
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:52.792
That's gross!

322
00:28:52.875 --> 00:28:54.333
You started it!

323
00:28:56.083 --> 00:28:58.042
What are you doing here anyway?

324
00:28:59.167 --> 00:29:00.708
Do you want to talk about Putu?

325
00:29:00.792 --> 00:29:02.958
Go tell Kadek or Wayan.

326
00:29:03.833 --> 00:29:05.125
I don't have time for that.

327
00:29:07.417 --> 00:29:09.667
I just want to chat with you.

328
00:29:10.542 --> 00:29:12.417
I thought you cared about me.

329
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.667
Pick another topic.
Stop talking about Putu.

330
00:29:17.583 --> 00:29:18.583
Fine, I'll go.

331
00:29:25.542 --> 00:29:28.792
Why are you mad at me?
Trying to start drama with me?

332
00:29:30.208 --> 00:29:31.792
I'm not mad at you at all.

333
00:29:32.667 --> 00:29:34.375
But you are.

334
00:29:35.625 --> 00:29:36.917
That's silly.

335
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.875
- You're talking nonsense.
- What?

336
00:29:40.625 --> 00:29:43.083
You're mad at me
and you're the drama queen.

337
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.750
Let's go home, Shiro!

338
00:29:54.667 --> 00:29:55.667
Hi, guys.

339
00:29:55.708 --> 00:30:01.250
Today, I'm gonna show you
some viral lipstick and skincare tips.

340
00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:03.958
The new 8 Shades collection.

341
00:30:04.042 --> 00:30:06.542
Now, let me show you how to combine...

342
00:30:06.625 --> 00:30:07.625
Cut!

343
00:30:07.708 --> 00:30:09.208
Can you handle that, please?

344
00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:11.542
Why didn't you tell me before?

345
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.542
Hey, De.

346
00:30:14.625 --> 00:30:16.083
You're here early.

347
00:30:17.292 --> 00:30:19.875
Can you wait?
It'll only take 30 minutes max.

348
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.625
Okay, I'll wait inside.

349
00:30:21.708 --> 00:30:22.708
Of course, Bli.

350
00:30:30.583 --> 00:30:32.125
I feel like doing a photo shoot.

351
00:30:37.667 --> 00:30:38.667
Made.

352
00:30:40.542 --> 00:30:41.542
Made.

353
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.250
Made.

354
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:46.250
Wake up.

355
00:30:47.125 --> 00:30:48.667
- What?
- Wake up.

356
00:30:50.375 --> 00:30:51.542
We have to go.

357
00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:04.125
I need to change first.

358
00:31:05.333 --> 00:31:08.667
Sis, can you get me the shirt
for tomorrow's product launch?

359
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:09.750
Yes, Putu.

360
00:31:11.042 --> 00:31:13.875
I hope you don't mind
wearing a promo shirt.

361
00:31:13.958 --> 00:31:16.250
It's cool, and the color
suits you perfectly.

362
00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:18.333
Okay.

363
00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:29.125
My look is still on point.

364
00:31:32.042 --> 00:31:35.750
By the way,
did you like the chocolate I gave you?

365
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.375
I gave it to Niluh.

366
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.458
But why did you do that?

367
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.833
Well…

368
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.583
Because I felt guilty.

369
00:31:53.125 --> 00:31:54.625
I ditched them for you.

370
00:31:54.708 --> 00:31:58.500
Just don't give her false hope.

371
00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:00.583
She likes you.

372
00:32:01.292 --> 00:32:02.292
What?

373
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.083
Really?

374
00:32:04.167 --> 00:32:05.875
You don't realize?

375
00:32:06.417 --> 00:32:07.417
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

376
00:32:08.208 --> 00:32:10.250
<i>- Does she, though?</i>
- Here you go.

377
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.500
Here, put this on.

378
00:32:13.958 --> 00:32:15.625
- This shirt?
- Yeah!

379
00:32:20.042 --> 00:32:21.083
Hurry up.

380
00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:31.167
- I look terrible, right?
- No, you look nice.

381
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.250
Are you sure? It's too vibrant.

382
00:32:33.333 --> 00:32:35.333
You look handsome in it.

383
00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.958
Let's not ride our bikes tonight.

384
00:32:42.917 --> 00:32:44.333
You can park your bike here.

385
00:32:44.917 --> 00:32:46.167
We'll take a car tonight.

386
00:32:47.042 --> 00:32:49.250
- Shall we?
- Hang on.

387
00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:50.333
What's wrong?

388
00:32:53.375 --> 00:32:54.958
I haven't taken my sleeping pill.

389
00:32:56.625 --> 00:32:59.458
Why don't you try not taking it
just this once?

390
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.250
I'll make you feel better.

391
00:33:02.125 --> 00:33:04.583
<i>This is gonna be a disaster.</i>

392
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.917
Shall we?

393
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.750
You have to fight your fears.

394
00:33:09.458 --> 00:33:11.000
Don't let them run wild.

395
00:33:11.083 --> 00:33:12.083
Let's go.

396
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:13.750
Come on.

397
00:33:22.917 --> 00:33:24.250
We're ready.

398
00:33:24.333 --> 00:33:25.583
Drive slowly.

399
00:33:28.708 --> 00:33:29.708
<i>I'm gonna throw up.</i>

400
00:33:29.792 --> 00:33:30.792
Are you okay?

401
00:33:31.875 --> 00:33:33.667
<i>No, hold it down.</i>

402
00:33:34.458 --> 00:33:35.875
<i>Don't throw up now.</i>

403
00:33:35.958 --> 00:33:37.375
Can you pull over, sir?

404
00:33:38.708 --> 00:33:39.708
Are you okay?

405
00:33:41.708 --> 00:33:43.500
<i>Do I look like I'm okay?</i>

406
00:33:43.583 --> 00:33:44.583
Made.

407
00:33:45.667 --> 00:33:48.333
Poor thing.

408
00:33:52.917 --> 00:33:53.917
Hello?

409
00:33:54.875 --> 00:33:56.292
I'll be right there.

410
00:33:56.375 --> 00:34:00.125
<i>- It's okay. It's only motion sickness.</i>
- I have to go. I'll call you.

411
00:34:16.208 --> 00:34:17.208
<i>Really, guys.</i>

412
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.208
<i>I really am fine.</i>

413
00:34:19.792 --> 00:34:23.958
<i>This is not an uncommon incident
when I'm with Putu.</i>

414
00:34:52.083 --> 00:34:54.417
Made, what's wrong?

415
00:34:56.208 --> 00:34:57.208
I'm okay.

416
00:34:57.875 --> 00:34:59.125
Sit down.

417
00:34:59.208 --> 00:35:00.458
I'm just a bit dizzy.

418
00:35:06.167 --> 00:35:07.167
Easy, easy.

419
00:35:17.417 --> 00:35:19.625
Come on. Sit down.

420
00:35:24.417 --> 00:35:25.917
Where were you?

421
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:29.375
Well…

422
00:35:32.042 --> 00:35:33.583
I was with Putu.

423
00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:38.792
She asked me to go with her
to a product launch.

424
00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.625
She forced you to go with her in a car?

425
00:35:45.417 --> 00:35:46.958
She knows you can't.

426
00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:50.958
And when you finally threw up,
she just left you?

427
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.833
Is that what happened?

428
00:35:53.958 --> 00:35:55.417
My gosh.

429
00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:01.250
It's okay.

430
00:36:01.917 --> 00:36:03.333
I'm fine now.

431
00:36:09.792 --> 00:36:11.458
Your shirt is blinding me.

432
00:36:13.833 --> 00:36:14.958
I didn't have a choice.

433
00:36:15.667 --> 00:36:18.500
She made me wear it.

434
00:36:29.792 --> 00:36:30.792
By the way…

435
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.375
Can I ask you something?

436
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.500
Go ahead, ask me.

437
00:36:45.083 --> 00:36:46.375
Putu told me...

438
00:36:46.458 --> 00:36:49.583
Can we not talk about her for once?

439
00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:52.958
She doesn't care about you.

440
00:36:53.875 --> 00:36:55.000
Don't you realize that?

441
00:37:01.042 --> 00:37:02.208
Let's go, girls.

442
00:37:03.417 --> 00:37:04.667
From the top.

443
00:37:09.792 --> 00:37:11.083
Down.

444
00:37:13.208 --> 00:37:17.542
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight…

445
00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:21.125
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

446
00:37:21.208 --> 00:37:24.750
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

447
00:37:31.458 --> 00:37:33.333
Which university do you want to go to?

448
00:37:34.542 --> 00:37:36.167
Dewata University, I think.

449
00:37:36.875 --> 00:37:37.875
You too, right?

450
00:37:39.167 --> 00:37:40.333
Are you copying me?

451
00:37:42.333 --> 00:37:44.958
That's the only place
that offers a puppeteering course.

452
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.000
Then I'll skip university.

453
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.292
University requires a thesis to graduate.

454
00:37:51.792 --> 00:37:53.958
But all I really need
is a wedding reception.

455
00:37:55.125 --> 00:37:56.667
Are you kidding me?

456
00:37:58.125 --> 00:38:01.292
Who taught you to talk like that?

457
00:38:01.375 --> 00:38:02.958
You're making me blush.

458
00:38:03.042 --> 00:38:04.208
Hey!

459
00:38:04.292 --> 00:38:05.333
Look at me.

460
00:38:08.625 --> 00:38:10.500
I think Niluh has feelings for me.

461
00:38:24.875 --> 00:38:27.375
Say something, guys. Aren't you surprised?

462
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.583
Or maybe you already knew?

463
00:38:34.667 --> 00:38:36.583
Knew about what?

464
00:38:36.667 --> 00:38:37.750
Niluh likes me.

465
00:38:38.708 --> 00:38:40.875
- You just realized that?
- Where have you been?

466
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.542
Why didn't you tell me?

467
00:38:46.542 --> 00:38:48.500
Because we thought you knew.

468
00:38:52.042 --> 00:38:55.000
- What should I do?
- What do you want to do?

469
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.333
Should I ask her?

470
00:39:02.417 --> 00:39:05.667
Then go for it.
You're not a stranger to her.

471
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.125
Or if you feel it's gonna be awkward,
then mention it playfully.

472
00:39:09.708 --> 00:39:11.500
- Good idea.
- I'll show you.

473
00:39:12.417 --> 00:39:13.417
Pretend you're Niluh.

474
00:39:16.792 --> 00:39:18.125
- Luh.
- Yeah?

475
00:39:18.208 --> 00:39:21.792
Do you know the difference
between 12:00 p.m. and you?

476
00:39:21.875 --> 00:39:22.875
What?

477
00:39:23.917 --> 00:39:28.917
12:00 p.m. is known as noon,
and I'd like to call you my moon!

478
00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:32.875
Stop joking around.

479
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:39.500
If you think you don't love her,
then just shut up about it.

480
00:39:40.083 --> 00:39:43.333
But if you do,
I can show you how to do it.

481
00:39:43.417 --> 00:39:44.417
Show it to him.

482
00:39:45.208 --> 00:39:46.208
Watch.

483
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.500
Is it hot tonight?

484
00:39:53.792 --> 00:39:54.958
I need a fan.

485
00:39:55.542 --> 00:39:56.583
For what?

486
00:39:56.667 --> 00:39:58.917
If you want to be my fan,
let's make a plan.

487
00:40:03.375 --> 00:40:04.958
Can you stop joking around?

488
00:40:06.667 --> 00:40:08.458
Lighten up, man.

489
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:10.458
Chill out, man.

490
00:40:10.542 --> 00:40:13.125
I have an idea. I'm not kidding this time.

491
00:40:14.583 --> 00:40:16.708
- Be Niluh.
- Be Niluh again.

492
00:40:19.958 --> 00:40:20.958
Luh…

493
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.292
I want you to think it over.

494
00:40:25.208 --> 00:40:26.917
I want you to reflect on it.

495
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.583
<i>You are my star
You're the only one I love</i>

496
00:40:30.667 --> 00:40:32.333
<i>I want you to…</i>

497
00:40:32.417 --> 00:40:33.708
I'm going to bed.

498
00:40:34.917 --> 00:40:36.125
He's mad.

499
00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:41.125
Why so serious?

500
00:40:42.083 --> 00:40:43.792
<i>I want you to think it over</i>

501
00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:45.458
<i>I want you to reflect on it</i>

502
00:40:45.542 --> 00:40:49.250
<i>You are my star
You're the only one I love</i>

503
00:40:49.333 --> 00:40:50.625
Seriously, quit it.

504
00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:54.292
Hand me that.

505
00:40:56.542 --> 00:41:00.500
<i>So everybody knew she has feelings for me.</i>

506
00:41:11.167 --> 00:41:13.333
<i>Don't tell me
you already knew it too, Shiro.</i>

507
00:41:13.958 --> 00:41:15.958
<i>What should I do, Shiro?</i>

508
00:41:17.625 --> 00:41:19.125
May you be blessed.

509
00:41:19.208 --> 00:41:20.417
May you be blessed too.

510
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.500
Here, for you.

511
00:41:22.208 --> 00:41:24.292
- What's this?
- A cake for you.

512
00:41:25.208 --> 00:41:26.333
Thank you.

513
00:41:28.083 --> 00:41:30.292
What are your plans today? Did you eat?

514
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.208
I did. I was going to bathe Shiro.

515
00:41:34.417 --> 00:41:35.833
Can you hold the leash?

516
00:41:36.417 --> 00:41:38.500
- Let me put this inside.
- Okay.

517
00:41:40.417 --> 00:41:41.917
Do you want a bath, Shiro?

518
00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:48.917
The water is cold.

519
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.417
It's refreshing for him.

520
00:41:51.292 --> 00:41:52.292
Of course.

521
00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:56.708
Your T-shirt is wet.

522
00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:00.083
It's okay.

523
00:42:01.125 --> 00:42:02.875
Let me get you a dry one.

524
00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:04.125
I'm fine, really.

525
00:42:04.208 --> 00:42:06.042
I don't want you to get sick.

526
00:42:06.125 --> 00:42:07.125
I'll be right back.

527
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.500
Here you go.

528
00:42:20.542 --> 00:42:21.542
Hello.

529
00:42:22.167 --> 00:42:23.333
Where are you?

530
00:42:40.792 --> 00:42:42.625
Okay. You're already there?

531
00:42:43.167 --> 00:42:44.708
I'll be right there.

532
00:42:49.542 --> 00:42:51.458
- Niluh!
- Keiko!

533
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:53.750
How are you?

534
00:42:53.833 --> 00:42:55.583
Praise the Lord, I'm fine.

535
00:42:55.667 --> 00:42:57.833
- And you?
- I'm fine too.

536
00:42:57.917 --> 00:42:58.917
This is Genzo.

537
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.458
Hello, I'm Niluh.

538
00:43:01.542 --> 00:43:03.125
Hi, I'm Genzo.

539
00:43:03.208 --> 00:43:04.250
Welcome to Bali.

540
00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:05.333
Thank you.

541
00:43:05.375 --> 00:43:06.375
Let's go inside.

542
00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:07.917
Bye!

543
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.875
Do you have a boyfriend?

544
00:43:09.958 --> 00:43:12.500
<i>In the midst of
my already complicated life,</i>

545
00:43:12.583 --> 00:43:14.000
<i>two more people came along</i>

546
00:43:14.083 --> 00:43:17.417
<i>who would later worsen my headache.</i>

547
00:43:24.792 --> 00:43:26.500
- Uncle.
- Keiko?

548
00:43:26.583 --> 00:43:28.208
Yes. Uncle!

549
00:43:28.292 --> 00:43:29.458
Keiko!

550
00:43:29.542 --> 00:43:30.542
<i>Her name is Keiko.</i>

551
00:43:30.583 --> 00:43:31.583
How are you?

552
00:43:31.667 --> 00:43:32.667
<i>She's Niluh's cousin.</i>

553
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.875
<i>They say she'd help her uncle
and his family moving back to Japan.</i>

554
00:43:35.958 --> 00:43:36.792
It was great.

555
00:43:36.917 --> 00:43:38.833
<i>The problem is not with Keiko.</i>

556
00:43:38.917 --> 00:43:41.583
- Auntie Padma!
<i>- The problem is with…</i>

557
00:43:41.667 --> 00:43:45.792
- You look so pretty!
- You're just saying that.

558
00:43:45.875 --> 00:43:47.083
<i>…this man.</i>

559
00:43:47.167 --> 00:43:48.958
<i>His name is Genzo.</i>

560
00:43:49.042 --> 00:43:51.708
I'm teaching
the Indonesian language in Tokyo.

561
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.958
That's wonderful!

562
00:43:54.042 --> 00:43:56.750
Incredible! You teach Indonesian
as a side job?

563
00:43:56.833 --> 00:43:57.833
What's your real job?

564
00:43:59.458 --> 00:44:01.458
I work as a voice actor in anime.

565
00:44:02.792 --> 00:44:03.958
Anime?

566
00:44:04.625 --> 00:44:06.833
Like in <i>Gundam?</i> Or <i>Naruto?</i>

567
00:44:06.917 --> 00:44:08.208
Yes, like those anime.

568
00:44:08.292 --> 00:44:10.208
Incredible!

569
00:44:11.417 --> 00:44:12.292
Boyfriend?

570
00:44:12.375 --> 00:44:13.375
Sir, ma'am…

571
00:44:13.458 --> 00:44:15.542
Hello. My name is Genzo.

572
00:44:15.625 --> 00:44:16.833
Nice to meet you.

573
00:44:16.917 --> 00:44:18.875
Genzo is the manager at my office.

574
00:44:18.958 --> 00:44:20.667
Manager?

575
00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:23.792
Mr. Manager, please guide her in her work.

576
00:44:23.875 --> 00:44:24.708
Yes, sir.

577
00:44:24.792 --> 00:44:27.500
- Does he speak Indonesian?
- He does.

578
00:44:28.167 --> 00:44:31.542
He often visits Indonesia on vacation.

579
00:44:33.167 --> 00:44:34.417
It's a hot country, right?

580
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.375
- Let's drink tea, okay?
- Thank you.

581
00:44:37.458 --> 00:44:40.750
Genzo, put your suitcase inside.
You must be exhausted.

582
00:44:40.833 --> 00:44:42.417
Luh, I want to explore the city.

583
00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.042
Don't you need a rest?

584
00:44:44.125 --> 00:44:47.083
How many times
have you vacationed in Indonesia?

585
00:44:47.167 --> 00:44:49.875
- Two times.
- I see.

586
00:44:50.542 --> 00:44:53.250
- Do you like it?
- I like it.

587
00:44:53.333 --> 00:44:54.417
It's beautiful, right?

588
00:44:55.375 --> 00:44:57.958
- We don't have that back home.
- In Japan.

589
00:44:58.042 --> 00:44:59.500
- You don't?
- No.

590
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.167
Niluh!

591
00:45:27.958 --> 00:45:29.375
Genzo.

592
00:45:30.042 --> 00:45:32.375
Where are you going?

593
00:45:33.083 --> 00:45:34.708
I'm going to teach dancing.

594
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.458
- Keiko?
- She's already asleep.

595
00:45:41.083 --> 00:45:42.792
Why don't you wear the uniform?

596
00:45:43.375 --> 00:45:46.292
- We didn't know the ceremony is today.
- Wasn't it tomorrow?

597
00:45:46.375 --> 00:45:48.417
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I forgot too.

598
00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.167
But you're wearing white.

599
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.917
- It's cream.
- You did it on purpose.

600
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.750
Even if we're different,
as long as the music's in sync,

601
00:45:55.833 --> 00:45:57.083
that's what matters.

602
00:45:58.792 --> 00:46:00.667
Guys, this is Genzo.

603
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.292
He's a friend of my cousin.
He just came from Japan.

604
00:46:03.792 --> 00:46:05.958
Hello, I'm Genzo.

605
00:46:07.458 --> 00:46:09.542
A good-looking guy.

606
00:46:10.208 --> 00:46:11.208
Excuse us.

607
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:15.000
Genzo<i>-san,</i> you can sit here. Sit here.

608
00:46:15.083 --> 00:46:16.125
- Sure?
- Yeah.

609
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:20.583
Thank you.

610
00:46:20.667 --> 00:46:22.375
<i>What did I tell you? The problem.</i>

611
00:46:22.458 --> 00:46:23.458
Genzo.

612
00:46:24.708 --> 00:46:25.708
Made.

613
00:46:44.583 --> 00:46:46.083
<i>Keep staring at her.</i>

614
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:31.125
<i>While Niluh is occupied with Genzo,
I'm occupied with Putu.</i>

615
00:48:03.125 --> 00:48:04.542
Was it exciting?

616
00:48:05.542 --> 00:48:06.542
It was.

617
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:11.250
Which part do you like most?

618
00:48:12.708 --> 00:48:14.000
Every minute of it.

619
00:48:14.083 --> 00:48:16.042
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

620
00:48:18.083 --> 00:48:21.917
Do you like the part where I flew?

621
00:48:22.625 --> 00:48:24.042
That's the best part.

622
00:48:30.042 --> 00:48:33.292
How about the part
where I throw Jovan into the sea?

623
00:48:33.375 --> 00:48:34.750
Especially that one!

624
00:48:34.833 --> 00:48:36.833
That's the most funny part, I love it!

625
00:48:41.542 --> 00:48:44.250
We didn't do either of those scenes.

626
00:48:47.542 --> 00:48:48.542
Really?

627
00:48:52.333 --> 00:48:55.417
Were you bored
waiting for me to finish work?

628
00:48:58.042 --> 00:49:02.167
Made, can I ask you something?

629
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Sure.

630
00:49:06.125 --> 00:49:10.042
I want to know how you feel
about our marriage arrangement.

631
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:14.500
Hey, Made.

632
00:49:15.417 --> 00:49:17.125
Where are you coming from?

633
00:49:19.042 --> 00:49:20.042
From the beach.

634
00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:24.208
We're on our way to grab dinner.

635
00:49:24.292 --> 00:49:25.542
Do you want to come?

636
00:49:27.167 --> 00:49:28.167
Sounds great.

637
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Sure!

638
00:50:02.292 --> 00:50:03.625
Hi.

639
00:50:03.708 --> 00:50:04.708
Hello.

640
00:50:04.792 --> 00:50:06.792
- Please sit down.
- Hi.

641
00:50:06.875 --> 00:50:08.125
Did you wait long?

642
00:50:08.208 --> 00:50:09.917
- Kind of.
- Just a little.

643
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:14.042
Keiko, what do you do in Japan?

644
00:50:14.125 --> 00:50:16.833
My job is called <i>"seiyu."</i>

645
00:50:16.917 --> 00:50:17.917
What's that?

646
00:50:17.958 --> 00:50:23.208
I'm a voice actor in anime.

647
00:50:24.333 --> 00:50:25.333
Do you like anime?

648
00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:27.250
I love it.

649
00:50:27.292 --> 00:50:31.167
Can you show me how you do <i>"seiyu"?</i>

650
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:33.708
Of course, but…

651
00:50:34.625 --> 00:50:35.833
Niluh<i>-chan</i> must help me.

652
00:50:36.458 --> 00:50:38.458
No way! I don't want to.

653
00:50:38.542 --> 00:50:39.583
I agree!

654
00:50:39.667 --> 00:50:40.750
Come on, Niluh.

655
00:50:40.833 --> 00:50:43.000
Niluh!

656
00:50:50.625 --> 00:50:53.417
Niluh!

657
00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:57.417
Okay.

658
00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:58.500
Why are you here?

659
00:50:58.583 --> 00:51:01.208
- We've been looking for you.
- Where have you been?

660
00:51:04.208 --> 00:51:08.125
I refuse to go against my principles!

661
00:51:08.208 --> 00:51:10.625
This is the way of the ninja!

662
00:51:10.708 --> 00:51:12.542
- That's Japanese.
- Right.

663
00:51:13.708 --> 00:51:18.167
Anyone who breaks the rules
in the ninja world

664
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:20.417
is trash!

665
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.625
Trash!

666
00:51:23.792 --> 00:51:24.792
Your turn.

667
00:51:26.292 --> 00:51:32.042
But someone who betrays their friends
is worse than trash!

668
00:51:36.458 --> 00:51:38.667
Made, do you wanna try it too?

669
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.917
- Come on.
- Do it, Made!

670
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.583
Made!

671
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:48.750
Let's go.

672
00:51:52.292 --> 00:51:53.792
Let's do it in Indonesian.

673
00:51:54.458 --> 00:51:55.458
Okay.

674
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.250
I love ramen noodles!

675
00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:12.208
I love ramen noodles!

676
00:52:15.417 --> 00:52:16.708
Wonderful.

677
00:52:17.375 --> 00:52:22.292
Made, in Japan, they would definitely
love to watch wayang puppetry.

678
00:52:22.875 --> 00:52:24.417
- Very good.
- Very good.

679
00:52:26.083 --> 00:52:27.083
My manager.

680
00:52:27.167 --> 00:52:30.708
- I think he's considering a career switch.
- Really?

681
00:52:30.792 --> 00:52:33.625
He doesn't want to be
a puppeteer anymore. Am I right?

682
00:52:42.167 --> 00:52:46.000
It's okay. We can
discuss it again in Jakarta.

683
00:52:48.125 --> 00:52:51.083
- You're set on moving to Jakarta?
- Of course.

684
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:53.375
I have a career in Jakarta.

685
00:52:54.375 --> 00:52:57.917
It doesn't make sense for him
to stay here when I'm in Jakarta.

686
00:54:15.917 --> 00:54:19.500
<i>I wish Putu had never told me
about Niluh's feelings for me.</i>

687
00:54:19.583 --> 00:54:22.083
<i>I wouldn't be so conflicted.</i>

688
00:54:47.708 --> 00:54:51.417
<i>I wish her feelings for me
had remained hidden.</i>

689
00:54:52.208 --> 00:54:54.500
<i>She could've gone back
to Japan without a worry.</i>

690
00:54:55.708 --> 00:54:57.542
<i>And I could move on with my life.</i>

691
00:54:57.625 --> 00:54:58.875
ACCEPTED

692
00:54:58.958 --> 00:55:03.333
<i>Like nothing had happened between us.</i>

693
00:55:05.292 --> 00:55:08.375
<i>Because there is nothing
going on between us.</i>

694
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:15.333
<i>I wish she had no feelings for me,
and that I felt the same.</i>

695
00:55:23.042 --> 00:55:25.542
I got rejected by Dewata University

696
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:34.250
<i>Please tell me I don't
have feelings for her too.</i>

697
00:57:04.042 --> 00:57:08.333
<i>Or maybe everybody
already knew how I felt about her.</i>

698
00:57:09.167 --> 00:57:11.917
<i>Everybody, including Shiro.</i>

699
00:57:13.042 --> 00:57:17.000
<i>Maybe I was the last one to know.</i>

700
00:57:21.208 --> 00:57:27.542
<i>And how do you express your feelings
for someone who knows you inside out,</i>

701
00:57:28.375 --> 00:57:31.000
<i>including your tendency to throw up?</i>

702
00:57:31.625 --> 00:57:37.917
<i>What if, right after I told her
that I love her, she threw up?</i>

703
00:58:06.875 --> 00:58:09.542
<i>So I decided to tell her
in a more indirect way.</i>

704
00:58:10.708 --> 00:58:12.208
<i>A way that I know.</i>

705
00:58:12.958 --> 00:58:14.125
<i>Using wayang puppetry.</i>

706
00:58:33.083 --> 00:58:34.208
Hey, Made, what's up?

707
00:58:35.125 --> 00:58:36.208
Do you need anything?

708
00:58:36.792 --> 00:58:40.750
I want to surprise someone.

709
00:58:41.708 --> 00:58:42.917
How can I help?

710
00:58:46.042 --> 00:58:50.625
Could you please translate this
into Japanese before Niluh leaves?

711
00:59:09.083 --> 00:59:10.583
May you be blessed.

712
00:59:10.667 --> 00:59:12.542
May you be blessed too.

713
00:59:14.583 --> 00:59:17.708
Can you make some leather puppets for me?

714
00:59:17.792 --> 00:59:19.208
Do you have the drawings?

715
00:59:19.292 --> 00:59:21.250
Yes, I have the drawings.

716
00:59:24.917 --> 00:59:29.333
<i>And like so many times
in my life, I lied again.</i>

717
00:59:29.417 --> 00:59:31.917
- Why in a Japanese style?
- I want it to be unique.

718
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.167
<i>One day, my lies will eventually
catch up with me like karma.</i>

719
00:59:39.708 --> 00:59:44.458
<i>But for now, let me lie.</i>

720
00:59:52.167 --> 00:59:53.417
Mom! I'm going.

721
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.667
Where are you going?

722
00:59:57.125 --> 00:59:58.125
Made!

723
01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:02.000
Where is he going?

724
01:00:02.083 --> 01:00:04.375
I don't know. He seems very busy.

725
01:00:07.708 --> 01:00:11.625
- And he's been acting strangely too.
- Is he going out with Niluh?

726
01:00:15.042 --> 01:00:18.667
<i>I wrote the storyline.
I also wrote the music.</i>

727
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:19.750
Once upon a time…

728
01:00:19.792 --> 01:00:21.792
<i>Now I have to memorize the narration.</i>

729
01:00:21.875 --> 01:00:23.708
Not <i>"musashi,"</i> it's <i>"mukashi."</i>

730
01:00:23.792 --> 01:00:27.333
<i>And it seems like this will be
the most tangled love confession.</i>

731
01:00:27.417 --> 01:00:28.833
<i>As tangled as my tongue.</i>

732
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.750
Musashi was the name
of a Japanese samurai.

733
01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:36.500
A samurai.

734
01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:12.542
Rama and Sinta met…

735
01:01:18.292 --> 01:01:21.667
When they were little…

736
01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:28.042
When they were…

737
01:01:28.625 --> 01:01:32.042
Still little…

738
01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:33.375
Children…

739
01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:35.542
Not <i>"komodo."</i>

740
01:01:36.708 --> 01:01:38.708
Not <i>"komodo."</i> It's <i>"kodomo."</i>

741
01:01:38.792 --> 01:01:40.625
Not <i>"komodo." "Kodomo."</i>

742
01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:49.625
Hey, get me a bottle of sake!

743
01:02:04.417 --> 01:02:05.583
They're beautiful!

744
01:02:11.167 --> 01:02:13.333
Putu came here the other day.

745
01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:16.833
She said she saw you
going into my workshop.

746
01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:21.917
She asked me what you were doing here.

747
01:02:26.292 --> 01:02:30.833
But I didn't tell her you were here
to commission leather puppets.

748
01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:35.125
Great. Thank you, sir!

749
01:02:35.875 --> 01:02:37.500
- I'll go now, sir.
- Sure.

750
01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:49.333
Made.

751
01:02:52.667 --> 01:02:54.708
Are you from Nuarta's workshop?

752
01:02:54.792 --> 01:02:56.750
<i>- There she is.</i>
- Did you order puppets?

753
01:02:57.417 --> 01:03:00.042
- Who are they for?
<i>- It seems like karma</i>

754
01:03:00.125 --> 01:03:01.750
<i>is finally catching up to me.</i>

755
01:03:07.625 --> 01:03:08.792
It's for a souvenir.

756
01:03:11.125 --> 01:03:13.167
Why didn't you ask my father to make them?

757
01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:16.000
I need them fast.

758
01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.583
I don't want to rush your dad.

759
01:03:22.208 --> 01:03:23.833
I see. Okay.

760
01:03:25.167 --> 01:03:26.208
I'll see you later.

761
01:03:26.833 --> 01:03:29.042
- I'm having a photo session.
- Okay.

762
01:03:31.958 --> 01:03:34.458
I know who you're planning
to gift that to.

763
01:03:38.042 --> 01:03:39.875
Bye. Take care.

764
01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:52.333
CONSULATE GENERAL OF JAPAN

765
01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:54.875
Thank you.

766
01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:05.458
Gosh, our visa applications
are finally approved!

767
01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:06.542
Yeah.

768
01:04:12.292 --> 01:04:14.000
I promised her.

769
01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:18.125
Ichika<i>-chan.</i>

770
01:04:20.792 --> 01:04:21.792
Yes, Dad?

771
01:04:23.708 --> 01:04:27.125
Yesterday, Made came to see us

772
01:04:28.417 --> 01:04:31.542
and he talked to us.

773
01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:39.667
He has something for you.

774
01:04:40.542 --> 01:04:43.792
SHINTA GOES TO JAPAN

775
01:04:57.917 --> 01:05:02.833
He just wants to say goodbye to her.

776
01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:07.250
That kid means nothing to me.

777
01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:13.500
I just don't want our baby
to get hurt even more.

778
01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:25.958
I know what you've been busy with lately.

779
01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:31.083
What show are you planning for Niluh?

780
01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:36.583
It's just a little farewell party.

781
01:05:38.542 --> 01:05:40.250
It was supposed to be a secret too.

782
01:05:41.958 --> 01:05:43.542
Does Putu know about your plan?

783
01:05:45.292 --> 01:05:46.333
No, Mom.

784
01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:48.833
Are you considering
Putu's feelings at all?

785
01:05:51.917 --> 01:05:53.250
I don't agree with it.

786
01:05:53.958 --> 01:05:55.167
Don't carry on with it.

787
01:05:56.542 --> 01:06:00.375
- Mom, it's just a gift to a friend.
- Just a friend?

788
01:06:01.042 --> 01:06:02.042
Are you sure?

789
01:06:04.333 --> 01:06:09.750
Trust me, if you go forward with this,
it will ruin your karma with Putu.

790
01:06:17.583 --> 01:06:21.708
Your betrothal has been planned
for a long time.

791
01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:25.125
It involves two large families.

792
01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:29.250
It involves our respect
as wayang puppeteers.

793
01:06:32.792 --> 01:06:34.875
Why are you being so reckless now?

794
01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:40.250
It's just a small show, Dad.

795
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.750
Sang Hyang Widi knows the truth
behind every word we speak.

796
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.292
Your mother and I, as your parents,
we have already warned you.

797
01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:11.042
But if you insist on doing it…

798
01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:17.875
I will leave the decision to the universe.

799
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.833
<i>First of all, we apologize.</i>

800
01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:39.083
<i>The reason we came here is…</i>

801
01:07:39.167 --> 01:07:40.250
<i>Forgive me.</i>

802
01:07:41.542 --> 01:07:42.958
<i>Sir. Ma'am.</i>

803
01:07:47.625 --> 01:07:50.667
<i>I just want to express my true feelings.</i>

804
01:07:56.083 --> 01:08:01.250
I also want to apologize
if I haven't been truthful with Putu.

805
01:08:02.667 --> 01:08:05.250
I tried so hard to love you.

806
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.500
But love never reached my heart.

807
01:08:14.542 --> 01:08:15.833
What do you mean, De?

808
01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.333
Forgive me, ma'am.

809
01:08:21.708 --> 01:08:24.833
I am here to ask for your permission…

810
01:08:27.042 --> 01:08:30.208
To withdraw from this betrothal.

811
01:08:52.208 --> 01:08:53.500
Do you understand…

812
01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:59.125
That the betrothal is a sacred thing?

813
01:09:01.417 --> 01:09:03.833
And it cannot be undone by anyone's will?

814
01:09:08.292 --> 01:09:09.292
Now…

815
01:09:10.542 --> 01:09:13.417
What do you think, Mr. Ketut?

816
01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:17.417
Sorry for not being able to honor
this betrothal commitment.

817
01:09:20.208 --> 01:09:23.583
Because it turns out,
when it comes to the feeling of love

818
01:09:25.125 --> 01:09:28.583
and finding your match,

819
01:09:29.583 --> 01:09:31.917
it's not up to us to decide.

820
01:09:32.458 --> 01:09:36.125
These are beyond our control.

821
01:09:37.625 --> 01:09:43.125
Only Hyang Widi can make that decision.

822
01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:57.292
What are your thoughts, Putu?

823
01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:00.583
I have no choice, Mom.

824
01:10:01.625 --> 01:10:06.833
If this betrothal is cancelled,
he'll be the one who's going to regret it.

825
01:10:09.792 --> 01:10:11.417
Let him face his karma.

826
01:10:33.583 --> 01:10:38.042
<i>The closer it gets to her leaving,
the more everything sinks in.</i>

827
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:41.083
<i>And it increasingly feels like a dream.</i>

828
01:11:16.917 --> 01:11:18.625
<i>But I won't back down.</i>

829
01:11:19.583 --> 01:11:21.750
<i>Whatever will be, will be.</i>

830
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:38.917
Niluh, I planned this show
because you're leaving.

831
01:11:40.125 --> 01:11:46.250
Consider this as a parting gift
and a goodbye.

832
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:48.750
To you.

833
01:11:55.958 --> 01:11:57.958
This place is better than I thought.

834
01:12:07.125 --> 01:12:09.875
Are these the wayang puppets you ordered?

835
01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:28.292
I don't want to spoil your show.

836
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:35.500
But I just want to see
what caused the breakup of our engagement.

837
01:13:35.167 --> 01:13:37.167
In the kingdom of Kosala…

838
01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:43.625
King Dasaratha and Queen Kausalya

839
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:47.958
had a firstborn son named Sang Rama.

840
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.625
He was an incarnation of the god Vishnu.

841
01:13:57.708 --> 01:13:59.708
In the kingdom of Mantili,

842
01:13:59.792 --> 01:14:04.667
King Janaka had a daughter
named Dewi Sinta.

843
01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:10.750
Rama and Sinta were a divine couple.

844
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:18.042
The incarnation of the god Vishnu
and the goddess Widowati.

845
01:14:33.042 --> 01:14:36.208
Once upon a time…

846
01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:42.917
Rama and Sinta met.

847
01:14:45.042 --> 01:14:48.750
When they were little,

848
01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:55.375
they fell in love with each other.

849
01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:58.750
But never realized it
until they were teenagers.

850
01:15:00.792 --> 01:15:04.208
One day, Sinta was

851
01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:08.417
kidnapped by Rahwana.

852
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:17.292
And he took her to a land

853
01:15:17.375 --> 01:15:23.042
where her little starling companion
couldn't go.

854
01:15:23.125 --> 01:15:29.500
Rama didn't know
if he'd ever meet Sinta again.

855
01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:34.583
But this was
his declaration of love to Sinta.

856
01:15:35.208 --> 01:15:39.625
By letting her fly away
like she did to the starling.

857
01:15:39.708 --> 01:15:44.208
In a hope, wherever Sinta went,
wherever she stayed,

858
01:15:44.292 --> 01:15:46.625
her heart would remain here forever.

859
01:15:48.458 --> 01:15:50.208
The kingdom of Alengka is destroyed.

860
01:15:50.292 --> 01:15:52.792
The ruins lay beneath Rama's feet.

861
01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:03.042
Rahwana was defeated,
with an arrow stuck in his chest.

862
01:16:10.542 --> 01:16:16.792
Rama and Sinta together again,
standing in a beam of light.

863
01:16:18.667 --> 01:16:25.208
Finally, Rama and Sinta
returned to the realm of Nirvana.

864
01:16:39.458 --> 01:16:43.292
<i>So whatever will be, will be.</i>

865
01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:06.792
Niluh!

866
01:17:06.875 --> 01:17:09.417
Why are you in such a hurry?

867
01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.083
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

868
01:17:11.167 --> 01:17:13.333
Thanks, I can get home on my own.

869
01:17:14.208 --> 01:17:16.042
You can go home with Keiko.

870
01:17:21.417 --> 01:17:22.417
You're still here?

871
01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:24.208
So what?

872
01:17:37.667 --> 01:17:39.042
What are you doing here?

873
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:42.083
I don't understand Japanese.

874
01:17:46.125 --> 01:17:49.292
But I understand Made's body language.

875
01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:56.667
I could choose any man to be my boyfriend.

876
01:17:56.750 --> 01:18:02.500
But I value my commitment
to my parents more.

877
01:18:06.625 --> 01:18:07.708
Now I understand…

878
01:18:10.208 --> 01:18:14.917
Why he couldn't keep the same commitment.

879
01:18:20.375 --> 01:18:22.625
Because he's loved you all along.

880
01:18:30.083 --> 01:18:35.750
Both of you have passed the friend zone.

881
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:40.958
And disrespected
the commitment of our parents.

882
01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:55.250
So now,
I'm excited that you're finally leaving.

883
01:19:00.667 --> 01:19:04.292
Because all this time…

884
01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:10.333
You've only been an obstacle
in my relationship with Made.

885
01:19:42.458 --> 01:19:43.625
Go after her.

886
01:19:43.708 --> 01:19:46.333
This is your last chance.
Your final moments.

887
01:19:50.958 --> 01:19:51.958
Go after her.

888
01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:00.250
Made.

889
01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:05.833
Think again.

890
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:14.833
About everything you've fought for
by following your heart.

891
01:20:22.708 --> 01:20:23.708
Me.

892
01:20:25.875 --> 01:20:27.167
Our future.

893
01:20:28.708 --> 01:20:29.875
Our dreams.

894
01:20:34.542 --> 01:20:37.208
Are you sure you want
to cancel our betrothal…

895
01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.958
That we've built together?

896
01:20:45.958 --> 01:20:48.083
Do you want to leave me for her?

897
01:20:53.958 --> 01:20:55.167
Forgive me.

898
01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:03.708
I haven't been honest
with my feelings all this time.

899
01:21:06.375 --> 01:21:08.958
I tried to fall in love with you.

900
01:21:11.208 --> 01:21:13.250
But the truth is, my heart said otherwise.

901
01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:24.250
I tried to follow your dream.

902
01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:30.000
But going to Jakarta is not my dream.

903
01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:33.125
So what now?

904
01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.000
Pursue your dreams.

905
01:21:44.208 --> 01:21:45.750
And I'll pursue mine.

906
01:22:41.542 --> 01:22:45.458
- Dad, where's Mom?
- She's already in the car.

907
01:22:46.333 --> 01:22:49.375
Our stuff has also been
taken by the delivery truck.

908
01:22:50.208 --> 01:22:51.208
Let's go.

909
01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:32.500
Kadek! Wayan!

910
01:24:33.875 --> 01:24:35.458
Let's catch up with Niluh.

911
01:24:35.542 --> 01:24:36.958
Didn't you meet her?

912
01:24:37.042 --> 01:24:38.583
Her taxi just left.

913
01:24:38.667 --> 01:24:39.958
Why didn't you tell me?

914
01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:41.583
How should we know?

915
01:24:42.708 --> 01:24:45.583
All right, let's go to the airport now.
Come on.

916
01:24:45.667 --> 01:24:47.625
How are you going to get there?

917
01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:50.125
On your bike? Can you catch up to her?

918
01:24:55.417 --> 01:24:57.333
No. On this wagon.

919
01:24:58.792 --> 01:24:59.833
Are you sure?

920
01:24:59.917 --> 01:25:03.042
- You won't feel nauseous?
- No. I can manage.

921
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Step on it!

922
01:25:29.542 --> 01:25:34.500
Hopefully, there won't be
any obstacles whatsoever.

923
01:25:47.792 --> 01:25:52.250
<i>My father always said,
every person is born with their karma.</i>

924
01:25:53.042 --> 01:25:56.833
<i>Every event in our lives is connected</i>

925
01:25:56.917 --> 01:26:00.708
<i>by choices and decisions we make.</i>

926
01:26:11.542 --> 01:26:13.625
I can't take it anymore.

927
01:26:13.708 --> 01:26:15.208
You'll ruin your clothes…

928
01:26:15.292 --> 01:26:18.458
<i>Up to this point,
everything has been decided for me.</i>

929
01:26:18.542 --> 01:26:22.333
<i>But this time, I choose my own path.</i>

930
01:26:22.417 --> 01:26:25.708
<i>I have to see
where this road will take me.</i>

931
01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.583
We're more than just friends.

932
01:26:32.458 --> 01:26:36.125
Because my feelings for you
go far beyond that.

933
01:26:42.667 --> 01:26:46.083
And I've been lying to myself

934
01:26:46.792 --> 01:26:49.708
because I know you're betrothed to Putu.

935
01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:56.875
<i>We share the same feelings.</i>

936
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.708
We share the same feelings.

937
01:27:02.333 --> 01:27:04.833
I haven't been honest
with my feelings all this time…

938
01:27:06.208 --> 01:27:07.208
Because I was afraid.

939
01:27:08.875 --> 01:27:10.833
I was afraid of losing you.

940
01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:20.958
Are you okay?

941
01:27:22.792 --> 01:27:24.000
I'm fine, Mom.

942
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:45.958
Niluh, pull over!

943
01:28:06.583 --> 01:28:07.583
Made.

944
01:28:09.292 --> 01:28:11.000
Did you just ride in that wagon?

945
01:28:13.208 --> 01:28:14.583
I'm doing this for you.

946
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.250
How could you leave
without saying goodbye?

947
01:28:21.917 --> 01:28:23.583
And why did you leave this?

948
01:28:24.958 --> 01:28:27.792
- Do you really want to forget me?
- What more do you want?

949
01:28:28.458 --> 01:28:31.208
Isn't it enough
that your girlfriend embarrassed me?

950
01:28:33.417 --> 01:28:35.083
We were betrothed.

951
01:28:36.875 --> 01:28:38.875
But Putu is not my girlfriend.

952
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:43.458
And I love you.

953
01:28:45.167 --> 01:28:49.542
Do you remember when you freed
the starling from its cage?

954
01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:51.583
I've just realized that

955
01:28:52.542 --> 01:28:55.292
I've locked away
my feelings for you all this time.

956
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.750
Just like that starling.

957
01:29:11.208 --> 01:29:12.708
But now, they're flying free.

958
01:29:16.917 --> 01:29:21.333
And one day, they will fly there.

959
01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:26.083
To catch up with you.

960
01:30:03.333 --> 01:30:04.333
Niluh!

961
01:30:08.292 --> 01:30:09.833
Farewell, Mukudori<i>-chan!</i>

962
01:30:50.542 --> 01:30:53.125
<i>Our paths finally parted.</i>

963
01:30:54.083 --> 01:30:57.875
<i>I don't know
if it's for a while or forever.</i>

964
01:31:24.708 --> 01:31:29.375
<i>But one day, I will walk this path again.</i>

965
01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:31.250
<i>The same road.</i>

966
01:31:32.208 --> 01:31:35.542
<i>So I can see where it leads.</i>

967
01:32:04.667 --> 01:32:07.000
- Good morning, Ichika.
- Good morning.

968
01:32:12.792 --> 01:32:14.083
You may start.

969
01:32:15.292 --> 01:32:16.875
Yes, I understand.

970
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:20.750
Okay!
