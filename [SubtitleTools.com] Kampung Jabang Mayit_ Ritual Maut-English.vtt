00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:08.625
WELCOME AND ENJOY THE FOOD

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:19.250
Take that!

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:23.250
Are you okay?

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:37.750
I won't hurt you.

00:06:59.916 --> 00:07:01.375
Can I take a look at your wound?

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:18.208
Let me take you to the hospital.

00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:21.958
Shush.

00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:30.708
I won't take you to the hospital.

00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:31.625
Calm down.

00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:56.208
I can't help you if you don't want me to.

00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:19.708
Your wound looks serious.

00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.458
It needs to be treated right away.

00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:48.875
I'm going to get some rest now.

00:09:50.916 --> 00:09:52.833
You can come in if you want to.

00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:23.875
You can sleep here tonight.

00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:29.875
Relax.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.125
I'm just boiling some water. Relax.

00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:34.541
To take care of your wound.

00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:20.125
Come here.
Let me help you treat that wound.

00:14:30.666 --> 00:14:33.250
The eggs you’re holding
belong to their mother.

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:36.375
They must be searching for them now.

00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:40.250
Give them to me.

00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:43.000
I will help you return them.

00:15:52.083 --> 00:15:53.833
You can treat your wound yourself.

00:15:55.625 --> 00:15:57.083
I'm going to take a bath.

00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:44.125
Stand up.

00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:55.958
Slowly.

00:22:04.916 --> 00:22:06.291
Get some rest.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.791
My name's Bayu.

00:23:33.875 --> 00:23:35.208
I'm Hujan.

00:26:27.875 --> 00:26:29.625
Hujan!

00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:32.333
Hujan, what are you doing here?

00:26:32.416 --> 00:26:34.208
-Hujan!
-Let go of me!

00:26:35.083 --> 00:26:36.541
Hujan, what happened?

00:26:36.625 --> 00:26:38.208
Let go of me!

00:29:03.416 --> 00:29:04.250
This one.

00:29:05.166 --> 00:29:06.208
And this one.

00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:08.083
This one too.

00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:12.375
Here.

00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:14.375
See all these drawings?

00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:16.250
All of them are your face.

00:29:17.541 --> 00:29:20.041
How could I have drawn you
when I hadn't even met you?

00:29:22.083 --> 00:29:23.791
Take a look at all of these women.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.041
I don't know them.

00:29:29.625 --> 00:29:31.875
I kept drawing their faces over and over,

00:29:31.958 --> 00:29:33.125
until one day…

00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:39.541
A few days ago, I started drawing you.

00:29:45.708 --> 00:29:48.416
I know it's hard for you
to believe it, Hujan.

00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:52.541
But trust me.

00:29:54.416 --> 00:29:56.875
I just don’t want bad things
to happen to you.

00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:03.916
I want to know
whatever you’re going through.

00:30:05.541 --> 00:30:07.666
Maybe we can end it together.

00:30:08.791 --> 00:30:10.583
Maybe that's why we met.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.125
When you're ready…

00:30:26.708 --> 00:30:28.416
I want you to tell me…

00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:32.750
everything that has happened to you.

00:30:38.791 --> 00:30:40.791
I won't hurt you, Hujan.

00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:57.666
Please get some rest now.

00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:24.291
I'm coming with you.

00:34:32.166 --> 00:34:34.875
Yeah!

00:34:58.333 --> 00:35:04.041
WE SELL ICE

00:35:35.708 --> 00:35:36.625
Bayu!

00:35:38.708 --> 00:35:40.041
Every drawing has changed.

00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:42.416
We knew that already.

00:35:58.583 --> 00:35:59.583
Hujan.

00:36:01.791 --> 00:36:03.750
I promise you, you will be okay.

00:36:11.458 --> 00:36:12.916
Let's just go home.

00:37:52.791 --> 00:37:55.416
FORTUNE TELLER

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.250
It's done.

00:38:43.625 --> 00:38:46.708
You won’t be bothered
by your ex-husband anymore.

00:38:48.958 --> 00:38:52.041
Thank you…

00:38:59.666 --> 00:39:01.083
I will be going now.

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:05.083
Thank you.

00:39:19.916 --> 00:39:25.208
FORTUNE TELLER

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:49.166
How are you, Awan?

00:40:17.875 --> 00:40:19.208
Here, I brought food.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.333
Can you grab my clothes for me?

00:40:31.916 --> 00:40:33.375
I bought new clothes for you.

00:40:39.583 --> 00:40:40.666
Thank you.

00:41:11.958 --> 00:41:13.000
Let's eat.

00:41:35.416 --> 00:41:37.541
-Bayu, I…
-I understand.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:41.875
When you're ready to talk,

00:41:42.916 --> 00:41:44.583
I will hear everything you have to say.

00:41:45.958 --> 00:41:47.250
But you don't have to do it now.

00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:50.791
I saw my friend earlier.

00:41:52.208 --> 00:41:53.458
Whenever you are ready,

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:55.791
we will go and meet her.

00:41:57.458 --> 00:41:59.000
Now, let's eat, okay?

00:42:38.333 --> 00:42:39.541
Thank you.

00:44:24.458 --> 00:44:25.333
Bayu.

00:44:54.125 --> 00:44:55.250
Get some sleep.

00:45:29.916 --> 00:45:31.000
Where are we?

00:45:35.958 --> 00:45:37.166
This is my dream.

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:25.416
Hey, Hujan. Hujan.

00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:27.166
Are you okay?

00:48:46.125 --> 00:48:47.958
We will go to my friend's place now.

00:50:21.375 --> 00:50:24.583
Can I see your hand?

00:51:16.666 --> 00:51:17.583
Come on.

00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:26.291
Hey!

00:54:46.125 --> 00:54:48.125
Her guilt is too strong.

00:54:48.208 --> 00:54:49.958
She's being haunted, just like you.

00:54:50.708 --> 00:54:54.291
Awan, how could I not feel guilty?

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.208
We have agreed that we were not ready.

00:54:57.291 --> 00:54:59.208
But that's not the only way.

00:54:59.291 --> 00:55:00.875
Who’s haunting me?

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.666
You were sleeping.

00:55:16.708 --> 00:55:17.916
Hujan.

00:55:20.166 --> 00:55:21.166
So…

00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:24.708
we want to tell you something.

00:55:27.583 --> 00:55:29.083
A few years ago,

00:55:30.833 --> 00:55:32.291
Awan and I…

00:55:39.875 --> 00:55:41.333
What happened?

00:55:47.458 --> 00:55:49.541
We were in a relationship.

00:55:51.416 --> 00:55:53.666
I got pregnant with our baby.

00:55:55.458 --> 00:55:57.208
We were not ready to have a child.

00:55:57.916 --> 00:56:01.541
It's also impossible to go to the doctor
and ask for an abortion.

00:56:04.083 --> 00:56:06.458
Without him knowing,

00:56:08.208 --> 00:56:11.791
I summoned Hitam using an ancient spell.

00:56:15.541 --> 00:56:18.958
Hitam gently stroked my stomach.

00:56:20.125 --> 00:56:24.041
Just as I saw in your past.

00:56:25.458 --> 00:56:28.416
But I’m too weak to seal her again.

00:56:31.125 --> 00:56:33.708
We've been trying to catch her, Hujan,

00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:36.125
but we never succeeded.

00:56:39.625 --> 00:56:42.791
Now, Hitam is out there,
looking for other babies

00:56:42.875 --> 00:56:45.708
from mothers who are uncertain
and reject their own children.

00:56:50.541 --> 00:56:51.541
Hujan.

00:56:55.125 --> 00:56:59.125
We believe that your dream
is the entrance to that realm.

00:57:01.208 --> 00:57:03.041
We can go together, Hujan.

00:57:05.541 --> 00:57:07.541
And get back at Hitam
for what she did to your child.

00:57:08.708 --> 00:57:10.250
For what she did to my child, Hujan.

00:57:13.625 --> 00:57:14.791
So…

00:57:16.791 --> 00:57:18.875
So, I can still find my child?

00:57:27.125 --> 00:57:29.333
When I entered Hujan's dream,

00:57:30.375 --> 00:57:32.250
I saw a painting of Hitam in that house.

00:57:38.166 --> 00:57:40.416
We can make her pay for what she did

00:57:43.375 --> 00:57:45.000
if you are willing to do it.

00:57:48.916 --> 00:57:49.916
Hujan.

00:57:50.833 --> 00:57:52.166
Calm down, Hujan.

00:58:03.708 --> 00:58:05.750
How can we kill her?

00:58:06.708 --> 00:58:07.708
But…

00:58:08.916 --> 00:58:12.166
that's the only way we can kill her.

00:58:20.416 --> 00:58:22.333
I will come with you, Hujan.

00:59:36.375 --> 00:59:38.000
You don't have to do this.

00:59:45.416 --> 00:59:47.333
You can still have another baby.

00:59:50.208 --> 00:59:52.708
A baby whose father you know.

01:00:12.916 --> 01:00:15.375
When I was kidnapped and raped…

01:00:18.458 --> 01:00:20.958
it felt like my life was falling apart.

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:24.541
I was weak

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.041
and vulnerable.

01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:44.625
All I wanted at that moment
was to drop dead.

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:51.416
But then I noticed…

01:00:54.625 --> 01:00:56.083
something different

01:00:57.541 --> 01:00:59.125
in my body.

01:01:02.958 --> 01:01:05.166
A new life is growing inside me.

01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:18.000
Then I realized
that the baby inside me was so…

01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:24.000
so much weaker and far more vulnerable.

01:01:43.416 --> 01:01:45.750
All of a sudden,
they threw me into the forest.

01:01:46.416 --> 01:01:49.208
In the darkness, I found myself thinking.

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:52.833
If only…

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.458
If I hadn’t been kidnapped,

01:01:57.333 --> 01:01:59.500
if I hadn’t been raped…

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.625
the baby I was carrying would never exist.

01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:19.750
And then, Hitam came

01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:23.666
and took my baby away.

01:02:38.458 --> 01:02:40.125
I will kill Hitam…

01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:44.541
and take my baby back.

01:02:54.708 --> 01:02:56.083
I'm ready.

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:37.416
Go to sleep.

01:03:38.666 --> 01:03:42.833
Go. I will look after you from here.

01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:46.333
Hujan.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.041
This is your dream.

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:51.500
You are the one in charge, not Hitam.

01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:37.791
This is my dream.

01:09:52.916 --> 01:09:53.833
Bayu!

01:10:38.041 --> 01:10:40.625
Hujan…

01:11:15.875 --> 01:11:17.791
Hujan…

01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:23.333
Hujan…

01:12:05.458 --> 01:12:09.666
Fight it, Hujan! Fight it!

01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:15.250
Hujan.

01:16:18.625 --> 01:16:19.958
Hujan…

01:16:25.875 --> 01:16:27.791
You want to kill Hitam?

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:37.125
Do you want to kill Hitam?

01:16:41.083 --> 01:16:43.708
If you want to kill Hitam…

01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:48.208
we need a body

01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:51.916
to be able to take her to our realm.

01:16:55.958 --> 01:16:58.750
Only you can carry her in your body.

01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:07.375
Only you, Hujan.

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:11.375
Only you.

01:17:13.291 --> 01:17:14.750
Not me.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:22.041
Because of your dream…

01:17:23.625 --> 01:17:26.958
Because of your strong desire to kill her…

01:17:28.083 --> 01:17:30.208
For the safety of the other babies…

01:17:31.125 --> 01:17:32.458
Please forgive us.

01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:35.041
Please forgive us.

01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:55.791
