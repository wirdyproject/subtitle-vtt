00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:32.750
One, two…

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.833
Hello.

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:36.291
One, two…

[indistinct chatter]

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:57.291
[woman] There he is!

[man] Mom!

[chuckles]

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.083
Congrats, dear.
My son officially has a degree.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.708
Thanks, Mom.

00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:09.916
Dad.

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:12.083
[sighs in relief]

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.375
I'm so proud of you, son.

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.416
[chuckles] You're amazing.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.375
Thank God you graduated
in eight semesters.

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:21.125
Any longer, and I'd be broke.

00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:23.291
[laughing]

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.375
Better get a job soon.

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:26.958
Try to get into the civil service.

00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:28.041
[whines] Dear…

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:31.291
Civil servants get pension benefits.

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:32.416
Amen.

Rifa.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.250
I graduated!

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.875

-I'm doing great.
-Hello, Aunty.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.458

[laughing]

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.208
Hey.

00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:54.458
You're more stunning than ever.

00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:56.833
Oh, please.

00:01:57.916 --> 00:01:59.375
-[Fatimah] Right?
-[chuckles]

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.166
Why can't we be like them?

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:08.875
You're looking good today.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.125
[Rifa] A picture?

00:02:12.208 --> 00:02:13.083
Let's do it.

[sighs in relief]

00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:30.333
So you're pursuing your master's in Jogja?

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.375
Maybe. It depends.

00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:36.416
On what?

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.625
Here, you can keep it.

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:44.791
In case you start missing me.

00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:46.708
You're so full of yourself.

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:49.541
-Who would even miss you?
-You will.

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:51.666
Rifa.

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:54.291
Shall we head home?

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:55.541
-Okay.
-All right.

00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:58.291
Fadly.

00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:01.916
Now that you've graduated, what's next?

00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:05.166
I'm going to focus on getting a job.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.375
Oh.

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:11.000
I pray that you secure a job fast.

Take care, Aunty, Uncle.

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:17.583
-Same goes for you.
-I will.

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:20.583
Sir, ma'am. We're leaving first.

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:26.375
-Until next time. Take care.
-Yes, we will.

00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:28.041
[laughing]

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:30.416
See you.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.833
-Bye, Aunty, Uncle.
-Bye.

-Come on, Mom.
-Coming.

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:51.541
I'm hungry.

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:53.166
Really? I've cooked for you.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.750

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.750
Careful.

00:03:57.833 --> 00:04:00.000
-Thanks, son.
-No problem, Mom.

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.916
-Come on, dear.
-Coming.

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:17.416
[Fatimah] How are you and Rifa?
Are you two dating yet?

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.083
[Fadly] We're just friends, Mom.

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:22.291
[Mustafa] Someone else
might beat you to it.

00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:24.583
[Fadly] I haven't really thought about it.

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:26.500
I think she wants to pursue
a master's degree.

00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:29.541
[Mustafa huffs] Her dowry will get higher!

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:40.125
[photographer] Ready? One, two, three.

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:42.791
Again. One, two, three.

-Excuse me.
-Okay.

Your dream finally came true.

Thanks to God.

for being there for me from the start.

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:21.166
We'll be able to sing and practice here.

00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:23.583
We'll stay together forever?

00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:26.041
You want to stay with me forever?

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:30.041
-How sweet.
-[Nisa laughs teasingly]

Fadly, this is great.

Kallang can practice here.

00:05:35.708 --> 00:05:38.958
Don't miss dinner tonight

At seven, right?

-You got it.

[off-key humming]

00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:50.958
Hey.

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:53.375
Even your humming is off-key.

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.000
Don't overdo it
when all you know is the C chord.

00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:58.583
How do you know, Ariping? Look!

00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:01.000
I know the E chord.

00:06:01.083 --> 00:06:02.875
I'm just learning more skills.

00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.916
Besides, I'm already the master
of wiring and gear setup.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.291
Not to brag,

00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:09.583
just facts!

00:06:09.666 --> 00:06:11.583
Says the one who got zapped yesterday.

00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:13.083
[laughing]

00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:15.916
I mean, with open wires and sweaty palms?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.083
It's a given.

00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:20.000
-Hello, Nisa.
-Hello.

00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:21.875
Come on, what do you know?

00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.291
I know my stuff.

00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:26.833
[man] Peace be upon you.

00:06:26.916 --> 00:06:28.583
And upon you peace.

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:30.625
Congrats, Fad.

00:06:30.708 --> 00:06:34.583
I'm glad everything went well today.

00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:40.708
I want to thank you again for your support

00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:45.666
and for letting me pay the rent monthly.

00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:48.416
You're welcome, Fadly.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.750
I used to be young and full of ego myself,

00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:54.500
so I get it.

00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:58.375
Besides, my place won't be empty anymore.

00:06:58.458 --> 00:06:59.583
[chuckles]

00:06:59.666 --> 00:07:01.916
I hope this business goes well.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.375
Hope you pay rent on time too.

00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:05.416
[laughing]

00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:07.041
Hi, Nisa.

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:08.875
-Sir.
-Hi.

00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.458
You're a charming guy,
and she's a lovely lady.

00:07:12.541 --> 00:07:13.916
What are you waiting for?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.166
[chuckles]

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.666
Wish me luck for that, sir.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.250
Sure, Amen.

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:21.416
Right, babe?

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.083
Who's inside?

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.041
Tell them off. They're always bickering.

00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:29.416
What are you playing?

00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:32.833
[clapping]

00:07:32.916 --> 00:07:36.333
I know you've got talent, Fadly.

00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:38.875
I'm sure you'll be
the next Ridwan Budiman.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.208
Who?

00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:42.333
My uncle. He sings really well.

00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:43.458
He's from Kendari.

00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:47.500
What? You look like
you're looking down on me.

00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:49.541
Because I am looking down on you.

00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:50.583
Hey.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.166
Speaking of which,

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.791
I think

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.625
I want to propose to Nisa.

00:07:57.708 --> 00:07:59.791
Praise be to God!

00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:01.333
[exclaiming] Thank God!

00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:04.041
Look at him, Ariping.
He's about to get married.

00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:05.916
-What about you?
-Look who's talking.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.583
You're paying for a premium dating app,
but still no girlfriend.

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:10.250
[laughing]

00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:12.833
The app is just broken.

00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:14.208
But seriously, when?

00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:15.500
But…

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:16.625
Huh?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.375
A three-in-one wedding?

00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:20.958
Kifly is going to propose
to his girlfriend, Karin.

00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:25.458
I figured you'd all get married in
a three-in-one wedding.

00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:28.375
I also talked to Mom,

00:08:28.458 --> 00:08:29.875
and she agreed.

00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.708
But… Mom.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.750
Why?

00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:35.666
You all know,

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.375
I'm past the age of earning money,

00:08:39.916 --> 00:08:44.708
but the dowry and wedding expenses
are getting higher.

00:08:45.166 --> 00:08:47.791
I've saved 300 million.

00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:51.000
It should be enough for your dowry,

00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:54.833
engagement, and wedding reception costs.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.541
But Dad,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.708
why can't have get our own weddings?

00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:01.291
We can earn the money ourselves.

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:02.833
I'm saving up as well.

00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:06.375
Fadly, listen. In our culture,

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.791
parents are responsible
for arranging their child's marriage.

00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:17.791
If I can't do it with my resources,

00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:19.791
I feel like I've failed.

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:23.833
How long do I have to wait
for you to be financially stable?

00:09:23.916 --> 00:09:25.250
Until I'm dead?

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:26.583
-Oh my God.
-Dear!

00:09:27.666 --> 00:09:29.916
How could you say that?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.166
Yeah, Dad.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.500
[Mustafa] Just trust me.

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:36.333
Fadly, talk to Nisa.

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:39.708
Kifly, talk to Karin.

00:09:39.791 --> 00:09:42.250
And Ahmad, talk to Asha.

00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:44.375
You're all going to propose this month.

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:45.791
What?

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:47.791
Are you two sure about this?

00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:49.833
[Mustafa] I've arranged everything.

00:09:49.916 --> 00:09:53.000
Next week, we'll go to Solo
to propose to Karin.

00:09:53.541 --> 00:09:56.541
After that, to Sengkang for Nisa.

00:09:57.125 --> 00:10:00.333
And finally, Jakarta for Asha.

00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:04.000
Mom…

00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:06.125
It's okay, son.

00:10:06.208 --> 00:10:09.916
You've all been in
steady relationships long enough.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.875
There's no harm in getting married now.

00:10:14.916 --> 00:10:18.291
What about Ahmad's girlfriend?
Does she want to?

00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:21.208
How did you come to that conclusion?
He's not done talking.

00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:24.041
Just trust me.
My feelings are never wrong.

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:25.000
Wanna bet on it?

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:25.916
Do you?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.875
[Pirre chuckles]

00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.125
Give me that.

00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:32.416
-The loser has to eat this.
-Everything?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.083
Yes, everything. You scared?

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:36.375
-Okay, deal.
-Deal!

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:39.250
I'd love to.

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:40.208
Really?

00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:41.833
Of course. Who would say no to a proposal

00:10:41.916 --> 00:10:46.458
from the handsome
young lecturer Ahmad Mustafa?

00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:47.500
[crunch]

00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:51.250
[wheezing, laughing]

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:52.541
[Fadly] Enough.

00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:56.375
Wish me luck, guys.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.333
Let's hope Nisa and her family
will accept my proposal.

00:11:00.416 --> 00:11:01.875
We'll pray for you.

00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.208
May Nisa accept Fadly's proposal. Amen.

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:09.500
[Kifly] So here's the concept.

00:11:09.916 --> 00:11:12.250
The balloons will go there…

00:11:12.333 --> 00:11:17.416
If you have no more questions,
I'll send the final draft tonight.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.125
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:20.083
[woman] Bye.

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:21.708
[Kifly] Adi, Aldhy. Is everything good?

00:11:21.791 --> 00:11:23.875
-All good.
-All right.

00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.750
We can't afford any mistakes.

00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:30.166
This is important for our portfolio
and the client's trust.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.625
Are you sure you don't need a rain shaman?

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.250
We don't need it.

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:39.291
Just in case you change your mind,

00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:41.583
my uncle is a rain shaman.

00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:44.375
I thought your uncle sold coconuts
at Losari Beach?

00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:46.458
That's his main job.

00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:49.666
But he can be a rain shaman if needed.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.291
He's got a range of skills.

00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:54.041
AC repairs, fan repairs,

00:11:54.125 --> 00:11:55.333
and even contractor jobs.

00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:56.625
-A contractor?
-That's right.

00:11:56.708 --> 00:11:59.041
He used to work as a firefighter.

00:11:59.125 --> 00:12:00.166
-A firefighter?
-Yes.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.041
Handled washing bodies at funerals.

00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:03.750
He can also install ceilings.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.166
Ceiling installation too.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.291
-Your uncle is amazing.
-He is.

00:12:07.375 --> 00:12:10.916
Anyway, now we just need
to take care of the food and the tent.

00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:12.458
-Right.
-Got it.

00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:15.625
We'll check the food portions…

00:12:15.708 --> 00:12:17.791
Let me see.

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:19.083
I can do…

00:12:20.083 --> 00:12:21.416
Good afternoon.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.875
You're here?

00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.541
This place is on my way home,
so I figured I'd stop by.

00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:29.458
-How is it going?
-[both] All good.

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.375
We should get going, Doc.

00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:33.416
Sit down.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.625
Hello. I got you coffee.

00:12:37.708 --> 00:12:38.958
Refreshments.

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:40.416
Thanks, babe.

What is this?

00:12:46.791 --> 00:12:49.083
What's with that grin?

Are you curious, or super curious?

00:12:55.625 --> 00:12:56.708
Super curious.

00:12:56.791 --> 00:12:58.333
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:12:58.416 --> 00:12:59.625
-[giggles]
-What?

00:12:59.708 --> 00:13:00.791
So…

00:13:01.416 --> 00:13:03.583
My assignment changed.
I'm not going to Bali.

00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:05.166
Okay.

00:13:05.666 --> 00:13:08.041
I'm assigned to…

00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:10.208

00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:13.083
-Makassar? Really?
-Yeah, Makassar!

00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:14.291
Yes!

00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:15.250
[chuckles]

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:16.541
How come? Tell me.

00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:20.666
That's what you get
for having a diligent girlfriend

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.625
who's never late

00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:26.625
and never says no to covering shifts.

00:13:27.208 --> 00:13:28.458
My girlfriend is amazing.

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.208
[chuckles]

00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:31.625
Well.

00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:35.500
Since I won't be stationed in Bali,

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.791
after we get married,

00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:41.083
let's go there for our honeymoon.

00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:44.541
Forget Bali, we're going to Europe.

00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:45.708
-Really?
-Just kidding.

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:49.625
-I'm joking.
-Then I'll let my parents know.

00:13:49.708 --> 00:13:52.791
-My little sisters… You have a suitcase?
-I'm kidding.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:54.833
Let's save up.

00:13:55.666 --> 00:13:56.791
You promise?

00:13:58.041 --> 00:13:59.333
-I promise.
-Promise?

00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:01.708
-Yes.
-Fine.

Wait.

TO YOUR PROPOSAL NEXT WEEK.

for the princess who's come
a long way from Sengkang.

Thanks, babe.

Any news from your parents
about the three-in-one wedding plan?

Well?

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.375
My parents

00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:54.500
agreed.

Thank God.

Yeah.

This is coto.

Careful, don't spill it.

This is jalangkote, and this is barongko.

I made this for your future in-laws.

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:53.041
We're only in Solo for one night.

And the coto broth won't make it
through airport security.

Don't worry. I'll handle it.

Do you speak Indonesian?
We don't understand.

Right, sorry. I'm just messing with you.

00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:01.166
[in Javanese] I can't believe an adult
can't speak Javanese.

[in Makassarese] He thinks
everyone speaks Javanese?

Javanese people may be everywhere,

but not everyone has to know the language.

00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:15.875
but he could only afford 50 million
for the dowry.

00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.916
-[laughing]
-He's right.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.666
It's unclear what he does for a living.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.666
He's neither a civil servant
nor a policeman.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.583
What is he, then?

00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:26.125
He's in a Makassar-based band.

00:18:26.208 --> 00:18:29.000
-[mocking laughter]
-That doesn't make money.

00:18:29.083 --> 00:18:32.000
If I may, Puang,
ask them to raise the dowry.

00:18:32.083 --> 00:18:33.916
-Yes.
-Only then will I give my blessing.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.958
50 million isn't enough
to cover wedding expenses.

00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:39.208
[all chorusing] Right.

00:18:39.291 --> 00:18:44.250
Especially with how expensive
things are these days.

00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:48.000
[lady] Imagine what
the neighbors would say.

00:18:48.083 --> 00:18:52.833
Daeng Erang's daughter, a widow,
got a dowry of 80 million.

00:18:52.916 --> 00:18:57.458
Actually, Haji Tauhid's son has been
wanting to propose to Nisa for a while.

00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:00.583
I told her so, but she ignored it.

00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:03.291
Dowry won't be an issue with him.

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:08.541
But listen, let our child choose
her own partner.

00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:11.208
-Parents must be involved.
-[woman] That's right.

00:19:11.291 --> 00:19:16.833
I won't let my only daughter
struggle in the future.

00:19:16.916 --> 00:19:19.833
I don't want my daughter to be miserable

00:19:19.916 --> 00:19:22.500
because she married someone
she doesn't love.

00:19:22.583 --> 00:19:26.000
[exclaims, laughs]

00:19:26.083 --> 00:19:29.041
Are you saying you've felt miserable
being with me

00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:31.041
because we had an arranged marriage?

00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:32.125
Listen.

00:19:32.208 --> 00:19:38.291
I can make my family happier than
your ex, who's now struggling!

00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:41.583
That's the whole point of the dowry.

00:19:41.666 --> 00:19:45.625
[Nisa's dad] To preserve
our family's dignity and nobility,

00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:50.458
and to vet potential husbands
and see who is serious!

00:19:50.541 --> 00:19:53.500
-[Nisa sniffling]
-[argument inside continues indistinctly]

00:19:55.625 --> 00:20:01.250
[somber music]

00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:09.000
Let's hope the song gets popular
and goes viral.

00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:10.250
[chuckles]

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:12.916
Yes, you can always count on me.

00:20:14.541 --> 00:20:15.708
Yes, thank you.

00:20:15.791 --> 00:20:17.833
-[Fatimah] Take it out of the car.
-Okay.

00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:20.083
-Peace be upon you.
-[Fadly] And upon you peace. Mom!

00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:22.083
-It's raining. Come on.
-Yeah.

00:20:22.166 --> 00:20:24.333
Help your brother.

00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:27.083
-Dad.
-Yeah.

00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:28.333
Give Dad the umbrella.

00:20:28.416 --> 00:20:32.041
[Fatimah] Dear! You'll catch a cold.

00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:35.083
-Thank God.
-Thank God.

00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:37.291
-We're finally home.
-[Fatimah] Gosh.

00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:40.708
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
I could've picked you up.

00:20:41.291 --> 00:20:43.500
With what? Your motorcycle?

00:20:43.583 --> 00:20:46.500
-Our car is at the repair shop.
-[Fatimah] Give that to me.

00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:51.666
What matters is your little brother's
situation is settled.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.500
Now it's just you and Ahmad's.

00:20:54.583 --> 00:20:57.416
Look, I got a lot of souvenirs.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.541
There's even some in the suitcase
from our future in-laws.

00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:01.541
That's a lot.

00:21:01.625 --> 00:21:05.333
Fadly, just focus on your wedding.

00:21:05.416 --> 00:21:06.750
I know.

00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:09.000
-Where's your ring?
-[Fatimah] Where's Ahmad?

00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:10.916
-[chuckles]
-Go inside.

00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:15.625
[gentle music]

00:21:15.708 --> 00:21:17.708
I'll have iced coffee with palm sugar.

00:21:18.583 --> 00:21:19.416
You?

00:21:20.416 --> 00:21:21.541
Anything's fine.

00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:30.083
Any recommendations?

00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:31.291
[waitress] Anything's fine.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:33.625
Just kidding.

00:21:33.708 --> 00:21:35.000
Would you like to try our green tea?

00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:45.791
Okay. One iced coffee with palm sugar
and one green tea.

00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:48.958
-[waitress] Please wait.
-[Fadly] Sure.

00:21:57.041 --> 00:22:00.000
So what did your dad say?

00:22:00.083 --> 00:22:02.458
Has he picked a date

00:22:03.125 --> 00:22:05.541
for me and my family to come and propose?

00:22:12.625 --> 00:22:13.583
Nisa.

00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:16.791
Yes?

00:22:17.625 --> 00:22:18.666
What's wrong?

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.250
Were you saying something?

00:22:21.708 --> 00:22:24.791
So when can my family come to your house?

00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:25.625
Oh.

00:22:25.708 --> 00:22:26.625
When?

00:22:27.291 --> 00:22:28.708
I'm not sure.

00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:30.500
He hasn't answered.

00:22:33.416 --> 00:22:36.000
I heard this month
isn't good for a proposal.

00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:36.958
[chuckles]

00:22:37.833 --> 00:22:39.000
What year is this?

00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:41.708
You still believe in that?

00:22:43.708 --> 00:22:45.333
Are you making fun of my family?

00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:48.708
What's with you?

00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:51.541
It's nothing.

00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:03.833
Mom, isn't this ring expensive?

00:23:03.916 --> 00:23:07.375
Let's not bring money into this.

00:23:07.458 --> 00:23:11.333
My daughter's smile is all that matters.

00:23:11.416 --> 00:23:12.791
[chuckles]

00:23:20.375 --> 00:23:21.416
Thanks.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.708
Enjoy.

00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:34.875
-Mom.
-Yes?

00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:37.666
You want coffee?

00:23:39.166 --> 00:23:42.625
No. I like this ring.

00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:44.833
Okay.

00:23:45.333 --> 00:23:46.625
I'll take this.

00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:51.625
[somber music]

00:23:54.083 --> 00:23:55.666
[engine splutters]

00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:57.791
[grunts]

00:23:58.833 --> 00:23:59.583
[clicks tongue]

00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:01.916
What now?

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.375
[sighs]

00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:09.958
[blows]

00:24:10.583 --> 00:24:12.625
Why did the motorcycle break down?

00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:16.958
Hey, answer me!

00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:19.833
Answer when someone's talking.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.666
Don't ignore them!

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.625
You think I wanted this to happen?

00:24:25.583 --> 00:24:26.875
What's with you?

00:24:33.916 --> 00:24:34.958
Miss, tissue?

00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:51.041
[sighs]

00:24:51.666 --> 00:24:52.375
Psst.

00:24:54.958 --> 00:24:56.583
What's up with Fadly?

00:24:56.666 --> 00:24:58.041
Did he have a fight with Nisa?

00:24:58.125 --> 00:24:59.000
[shushes] Shh!

00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:01.875
Psst, Fadly.

00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:04.833
Sorry, I don't mean to pry,

00:25:04.916 --> 00:25:06.708
but are you okay?

00:25:06.791 --> 00:25:07.958
[sighs]

00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:17.708
Actually,

00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:20.875
there's nothing wrong.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.833
But since things between Nisa and me
are getting serious,

00:25:26.916 --> 00:25:29.541
tiny problems can feel huge.

00:25:29.625 --> 00:25:31.500
That's true, Fadly.

00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:33.125
This is only before marriage.

00:25:33.208 --> 00:25:37.291
After marriage, many couples get divorced
over tiny things.

00:25:37.375 --> 00:25:40.625
Huh, really? Like what?

00:25:40.708 --> 00:25:42.083
You need an example?

00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:44.708
Have you been living under a rock?
Get out more!

00:25:44.791 --> 00:25:47.666
Go on, tell him.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.125
[witty music]

00:25:49.208 --> 00:25:50.875
I heard in Makassar Info,

00:25:50.958 --> 00:25:54.750
a husband divorced his wife
because her butt was dark.

00:25:54.833 --> 00:25:56.708
That's just her natural skin color.

00:25:57.916 --> 00:25:59.833
If he wanted white,
he should've picked a cow.

00:26:00.541 --> 00:26:01.916
You hear that?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.541
Even the AC setting
can tear a marriage apart.

00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:07.666
That's why communication is important.

00:26:09.541 --> 00:26:10.833
Just talk to her.

00:26:10.916 --> 00:26:13.125
[witty music]

00:26:13.208 --> 00:26:14.250
[Fadly] Peace be upon you.

00:26:14.333 --> 00:26:17.666
-And upon you peace.
-And upon you peace.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.958
Fadly. Sit down.

00:26:20.625 --> 00:26:22.166
Your mom wants to talk.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.541
You say it.

00:26:29.041 --> 00:26:29.958
What?

00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:32.000
You're drenched.

00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:34.291
Yeah. It's pouring outside.

00:26:39.333 --> 00:26:41.583
How did things go with you and Nisa?

00:26:42.666 --> 00:26:44.666
She went back to Sengkang

00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:47.791
to discuss things with her parents.

00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:56.000
If that's the case, great.

00:26:57.125 --> 00:26:59.208
You should go there too.

00:26:59.875 --> 00:27:04.500
Show her your good intentions

00:27:04.583 --> 00:27:07.083
and commitment towards her.

00:27:08.458 --> 00:27:10.625
If I leave now,

00:27:10.708 --> 00:27:12.916
it's a five-hour ride by motorcycle.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.791
I'd get there at night.

00:27:16.125 --> 00:27:17.375
For Nisa?

00:27:18.875 --> 00:27:21.041
That shouldn't be a problem.

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:24.250
Your mom is right.

00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:27.041
Make sure you go tomorrow morning.

00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:30.375
[adventure music]

00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:51.708
[thunder crackles]

00:27:53.458 --> 00:27:56.500
[Nisa's uncle] Ladies and gentlemen
and all honored guests.

00:27:56.583 --> 00:27:58.416
On this joyous day,

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.291
we, representing Nisa's extended family,

00:28:02.375 --> 00:28:05.125
gladly accept Agus's proposal

00:28:05.208 --> 00:28:09.166
with a dowry of 500 million rupiah.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.708
[crowd] Praise be to God.

00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:14.166
We have come to an agreement

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:18.125
that both the marriage ceremony
and the reception

00:28:18.208 --> 00:28:21.375
will be on Wednesday, May 22, 2019.

00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:25.541
[voice fades]

00:28:38.833 --> 00:28:40.125
Here you go.

00:28:40.208 --> 00:28:43.750
Place it on the right. That's it.

00:28:43.833 --> 00:28:45.458
-Excuse me.
-Lor!

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.291
Excuse me, sir.

00:28:47.958 --> 00:28:49.375
What was going on here?

00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:51.333
A marriage proposal.

00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:54.666
Tomorrow will be crazy.
The dowry is 500 million.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:55.583
Huh?

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.041
[hushed] But I heard

00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:02.041
Nisa was already in a relationship.

00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:05.375
You should go in.

00:29:05.833 --> 00:29:07.541
That bastard!

00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:09.375
Calm down, dear.

00:29:09.458 --> 00:29:11.083
You want me to stay calm?

00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:13.958
Who's left humiliated
now that this has happened?

00:29:14.041 --> 00:29:14.833

-Just talk.

You can give her my number, Mom.

00:39:07.625 --> 00:39:09.125
I don't have it memorized.

00:39:09.208 --> 00:39:11.541

That's a sin.

00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:17.666
No, Mom. This is work.

00:39:18.166 --> 00:39:19.333
I'll see you at home.

-Okay.
-[Fadly] Hello?

00:39:25.666 --> 00:39:28.125
He's not usually like this.
He's just busy.

00:39:28.208 --> 00:39:32.791
Sorry that the introduction was so brief.

00:39:35.125 --> 00:39:36.833
[somber acoustic]

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:39.375
-He looks busy.
-[Fadly] I can handle it.

00:39:39.458 --> 00:39:41.375
We'll come again sometimes.

00:39:41.458 --> 00:39:42.791
Let's go home.

00:39:44.416 --> 00:39:45.416
[Fatimah] Well, Fad?

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.875
What?

00:39:48.333 --> 00:39:49.458
It's hot.

00:39:50.083 --> 00:39:51.833
-Give it to me.
-Careful.

00:39:55.083 --> 00:39:56.333
Alisa.

00:39:57.208 --> 00:39:59.250
[Fatimah] She's a sweet girl.

00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:04.166
Her mom and I are close.

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.458
It will be easier
to convince their family.

00:40:08.541 --> 00:40:11.416
Alisa can still continue her studies.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.416
She's got a lot ahead of her.

00:40:13.916 --> 00:40:16.791
Plus, she's not my type anyway.

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:19.208
What, are you buying a house?

00:40:19.291 --> 00:40:22.291
You have to have a type
when choosing a partner.

00:40:22.375 --> 00:40:23.708
-[Ahmad] True.
-For compatibility.

00:40:23.791 --> 00:40:27.625
Come on, Fadly. We're running out of time.

00:40:27.708 --> 00:40:29.250
Your Mom is right.

00:40:29.333 --> 00:40:31.875
Don't get stressed
looking for someone else.

00:40:32.708 --> 00:40:37.458
I don't feel the vibe with Alisa.

00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:41.416
We aren't in sync.
There's no chemistry whatsoever.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:45.250
Forget about connection,
vibe, or chemistry.

00:40:45.333 --> 00:40:48.166
Your Father and I didn't have that either.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:50.250
You're making it too complicated.

00:40:50.333 --> 00:40:52.125
But that's what you need these days.

00:40:52.208 --> 00:40:54.208
Just say you don't like her.

00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:55.500
I told you.

00:40:56.958 --> 00:40:57.750
Can I eat now?

00:40:57.833 --> 00:40:59.875
Yes, help yourself.

00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:04.750
[Mustafa] Ahmad, everything ready?

00:41:04.833 --> 00:41:07.625
Yes, Dad. Our flight is at five
in the evening tomorrow.

00:41:08.083 --> 00:41:08.916
Dear.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:09.708
Huh?

00:41:09.791 --> 00:41:12.958
Which one should I wear to Jakarta?

00:41:13.041 --> 00:41:15.666
This one or that one?

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.458
Which one?

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:19.291
-Umm…
-The white one.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.041
This isn't white.

00:41:21.125 --> 00:41:23.916
It's ivory, dear.
The shade of elephant tusks.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.250
Okay.

00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:28.916
But I think I'll wear this one.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.375
This looks more elegant.
Looks good, right?

00:41:31.458 --> 00:41:32.625
-[Ahmad] Yes, Mom.
-[Fatimah] Right?

00:41:32.708 --> 00:41:34.541
-Sure.
-[Fatimah] Good.

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:36.791
I'll put it in the suitcase.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.166
You can't rush into choosing a partner.

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.291
Take it easy. Go slow and steady.

On one hand,

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.708
I've been with Nisa a long time.

00:42:30.458 --> 00:42:32.958
I know her and her family well.

00:42:34.666 --> 00:42:37.500
I know this isn't her wish.

00:42:38.083 --> 00:42:40.375
It must be her family's.

00:42:41.416 --> 00:42:45.083
I don't have the energy
to start a relationship with someone else.

00:42:47.666 --> 00:42:49.166
On the other hand,

00:42:51.083 --> 00:42:53.916
I don't want to disappoint Mom and Dad.

00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:58.666
All right then.

00:42:59.583 --> 00:43:03.041

00:49:19.125 --> 00:49:20.416
Should I introduce you to my friend?

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.541
No, no!

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.791
You know he's got weird taste.

00:49:23.875 --> 00:49:26.625
I'm serious. Just take a look.

00:49:27.458 --> 00:49:28.458
Ta-da.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.083
Pirre? He was my friend in high school.

00:49:32.166 --> 00:49:34.500
Oh, you were high school friends?

00:49:34.583 --> 00:49:35.958
[coughs, farts]

00:49:38.333 --> 00:49:39.333
[farts]

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:41.291
Yes.

00:49:41.375 --> 00:49:44.958
Pirre and I work together.

00:49:45.041 --> 00:49:47.541
We've set up a small studio.

00:49:47.625 --> 00:49:48.833
Sounds fun.

00:49:49.833 --> 00:49:51.458
[laughs, farts]

00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:53.125
[clears throat]

00:49:58.125 --> 00:49:59.083
[farts]

00:49:59.625 --> 00:50:00.625
Are you sick?

00:50:00.708 --> 00:50:02.208
No. [farts]

00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:03.208
[grunts]

00:50:03.291 --> 00:50:05.333
You set me up with a fart machine?

00:50:05.416 --> 00:50:07.958
[cackles]

00:50:08.041 --> 00:50:10.875
Actually, I used to be close with her,

00:50:10.958 --> 00:50:13.333
but she was obsessed with salted eggs,

00:50:13.416 --> 00:50:15.208
which made her fart a lot.

00:50:15.291 --> 00:50:17.750
Whatever. You're driving me crazy.

00:50:17.833 --> 00:50:18.708
[phone buzzing]

00:50:18.791 --> 00:50:21.875
What a bad friend. You set him up.

00:50:23.875 --> 00:50:24.791
Hey.

00:50:25.416 --> 00:50:27.166
What was your ex's name again?

00:50:27.875 --> 00:50:28.666
Rifa?

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:30.708
She's not my ex.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.666
Just a friend.

00:50:34.208 --> 00:50:35.833
I wasn't that confident.

00:50:35.916 --> 00:50:37.708
Why?

00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:42.416
If Nisa's family didn't want me
as a son-in-law,

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.458
Rifa's parents definitely won't.

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:48.208
You know the biggest rice factory
in Sidrap?

00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:49.208
Yeah?

00:50:49.291 --> 00:50:50.083
It's her uncle's.

00:50:50.166 --> 00:50:53.000
And the Mutiara City housing complexes

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.958
in Makassar,

00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:57.458
Kendari, Parepare, Manado,

00:50:57.541 --> 00:50:59.083
and the new one in Bali?

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:00.958
All owned by her father.

00:51:02.625 --> 00:51:04.083
What's her social media?

00:51:04.708 --> 00:51:06.000
What are you doing?

00:51:06.833 --> 00:51:08.625
Who knows? She could be into me.

00:51:08.708 --> 00:51:11.833
Fadly's way better than you.

00:51:11.916 --> 00:51:13.625
While you look like this.

00:51:14.458 --> 00:51:17.041
When you don't try,
you only have one outcome.

00:51:17.125 --> 00:51:18.041
Failure.

00:51:18.125 --> 00:51:20.291
But if you try, it's 50-50.

00:51:20.375 --> 00:51:22.083
Success or failure.

00:51:22.166 --> 00:51:23.500
[Malik] Pirre is right.

00:51:24.375 --> 00:51:25.791
Mr. Malik.

00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:26.958
Amazing.

00:51:27.041 --> 00:51:28.041
Sir.

00:51:28.583 --> 00:51:29.750
Go ahead.

00:51:31.625 --> 00:51:33.250
Why not give it a shot?

00:51:38.125 --> 00:51:40.541
You're almost out of time.

00:51:41.125 --> 00:51:42.791
You've got to make a move.

00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:45.125
I know, sir.

00:51:46.125 --> 00:51:47.291
But…

00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:48.166
[clicks tongue]

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.958
It's heavy. I'm still traumatized.

00:51:54.708 --> 00:51:55.958
Do you know

00:51:57.041 --> 00:51:58.875
what knowledge is the most important?

00:52:00.291 --> 00:52:01.166
What?

00:52:01.666 --> 00:52:04.083
The most important knowledge

00:52:04.166 --> 00:52:07.083
is one where you understand yourself.

00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:12.333
How well you understand your capabilities.

00:52:12.416 --> 00:52:14.500
Your weaknesses

00:52:15.916 --> 00:52:17.583
and your strengths.

00:52:18.375 --> 00:52:23.250
Humans are God's greatest creation,

00:52:23.333 --> 00:52:26.625
and it's up to us to make the most of it

00:52:26.708 --> 00:52:29.458
to grow our goodness.

00:52:32.333 --> 00:52:34.500
Even the worst of people

00:52:35.041 --> 00:52:37.750
seek out good ones.

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:39.875
And being a good person

00:52:40.875 --> 00:52:43.666
is your strength.

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:46.791
[tender music]

00:52:46.875 --> 00:52:47.791
[chuckles]

00:52:57.375 --> 00:52:59.916
[Fatimah] Dear, what should we do?

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.625
We must send out the invitations now.
We're running out of time.

00:53:04.708 --> 00:53:07.916
[Mustafa] Well, what can we do?

00:53:09.916 --> 00:53:11.958
Fadly hasn't found his match.

00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:15.208
[Fatimah] What if

00:53:16.083 --> 00:53:18.916
we postpone Fadly's wedding for now?

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.416
No!

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.041
No way!

00:53:22.125 --> 00:53:24.458
How can I keep my honor?

00:53:25.916 --> 00:53:30.208
Plus, Nisa's family
will just get more arrogant.

00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:32.791
[Mustafa] Dear, you know

00:53:33.666 --> 00:53:36.750
I can only afford one wedding.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.041
[Fatimah] But what if Fadly
is still heartbroken?

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:45.916
He hasn't healed.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.041
Wounds can be healed
if we push through them.

00:53:49.625 --> 00:53:50.958
No need to spoil him.

00:53:52.875 --> 00:53:56.666
Wounds can be healed
if we push through them?

00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.500
[groans]

00:53:59.583 --> 00:54:01.833
-No need to spoil him.
-[groaning]

00:54:02.375 --> 00:54:03.541
[whines]

00:54:04.291 --> 00:54:06.666
[somber music]

00:54:10.166 --> 00:54:11.291
[sighs]

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:15.458
Hi, how are you?

00:54:21.708 --> 00:54:23.083
[exhales]

00:54:27.083 --> 00:54:28.125
Fadly.

00:54:29.083 --> 00:54:31.791
Come here. I want to talk to you.

00:54:38.166 --> 00:54:39.375
[sighs]

00:54:39.458 --> 00:54:40.541
What's up, Dad?

00:54:42.541 --> 00:54:43.583
How is it going?

00:54:46.083 --> 00:54:48.166
How is what going?

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:51.916
Oh.

00:54:52.583 --> 00:54:53.875
My studio?

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:58.291
It's going well. We're making progress.

00:54:58.375 --> 00:55:02.500
Your studio is growing,
but you still can't find a partner.

00:55:05.375 --> 00:55:08.875
Marriage is
a once-in-a-lifetime commitment.

00:55:10.708 --> 00:55:12.833
I don't want to choose the wrong partner.

00:55:12.916 --> 00:55:17.041
But remember, time is running out.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.250
I'll introduce you to

00:55:22.208 --> 00:55:23.541
Aunty Ina's daughter.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.666
You want to set up an arranged marriage?

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:31.208
It's not an arranged marriage.

00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:35.791
You're just meeting up.
She could be the one.

00:55:35.875 --> 00:55:37.333
You never know.

00:55:38.125 --> 00:55:39.541
[Fatimah] Yes, dear.

00:55:39.625 --> 00:55:41.166
Get to know each other first.

00:55:41.916 --> 00:55:45.625
Aunty Ina is my close friend.

00:55:45.708 --> 00:55:47.458
I know, Mom.

00:55:48.166 --> 00:55:51.416
But you only know Aunty Ina,
not her daughter.

00:55:51.916 --> 00:55:53.708
Yes, but…

00:55:54.708 --> 00:55:56.000
Wait.

00:55:57.125 --> 00:55:59.000
Look at this.

00:56:03.166 --> 00:56:04.208
Which one is she?

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:08.041
That one.

00:56:13.875 --> 00:56:15.041
[sighs]

00:56:16.541 --> 00:56:19.958
That sour look on your face
reminds me of jalangkote sambal.

00:56:20.708 --> 00:56:22.666
That analogy feels off.

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.541
Jalangkote is always sour.

00:56:26.041 --> 00:56:28.416
Come on, don't stress it, Fadly.

00:56:29.958 --> 00:56:33.000
I've had enough
of these matchmaking attempts.

00:56:33.083 --> 00:56:36.000
[Pirre] It's not matchmaking.
You're just meeting up.

00:56:36.083 --> 00:56:38.416
She could be the one. You never know.

00:56:39.416 --> 00:56:41.583
I think my dad said that too.

00:56:42.125 --> 00:56:45.333
[in deeper voice] "It's not matchmaking.
You're just meeting up."

00:56:45.416 --> 00:56:48.333
"She could be the one. You never know."

00:56:48.416 --> 00:56:50.916
[in normal voice]
Do I sound like Mr. Mustafa? [laughs]

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:53.291
[man] Hey, Fadly!

00:56:54.125 --> 00:56:55.625
What's going on?

00:56:56.458 --> 00:56:59.541
Why are you still talking to Nisa?
She's engaged!

00:56:59.625 --> 00:57:01.208
I never contacted her.

00:57:01.291 --> 00:57:03.916
Talk to her again,
and I'll wreck this place.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.875
-[clamoring]
-Hey!

00:57:05.958 --> 00:57:07.166
Keep that in mind.

00:57:09.708 --> 00:57:10.833
[grunts]

00:57:10.916 --> 00:57:12.166
Hey, mophead!

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.208
I've got more hair than you,
even though mine's an afro!

00:57:15.708 --> 00:57:16.791
Are you okay?

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.166
Fadly, are you hurt anywhere?

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:21.583
No, right?

00:57:21.666 --> 00:57:22.875
[grunts]

00:57:22.958 --> 00:57:24.166
That pisses me off!

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:27.000
When I get mad, I start shaking.

00:57:27.083 --> 00:57:29.500
[Ina] Fatimah, how are you?

00:57:29.583 --> 00:57:31.833
Long time no see.

00:57:31.916 --> 00:57:35.458
It's been a while. I've been great.

00:57:35.541 --> 00:57:39.625
I believe it's been five years
since you moved.

00:57:39.708 --> 00:57:43.125
Yeah, I went with my husband
five years ago.

00:57:43.208 --> 00:57:44.833
-Right.
-Wait.

00:57:44.916 --> 00:57:48.458
Sri! Make some drinks for our guests.

00:57:48.541 --> 00:57:49.583
[Ina] Oh…

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.875
How's Mustafa doing? Is he well?

00:57:51.958 --> 00:57:55.333
He's fine. But I'm sorry he couldn't come.

00:57:55.416 --> 00:57:57.083
He sends his regards.

00:57:57.166 --> 00:58:01.208
It's fine, I'm just glad
I met you after so long.

00:58:01.291 --> 00:58:03.791
[Fatimah] That's why
we should meet up more often.

00:58:03.875 --> 00:58:04.875
Of course.

00:58:04.958 --> 00:58:08.416
By the way, where's your child that
you want to introduce to Fadly?

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.458
Gosh, I almost forgot.

00:58:10.541 --> 00:58:12.208
Here she is. Sri.

00:58:12.666 --> 00:58:13.458
[Fatimah] It's her?

00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:15.291
-Yes.
-Oh.

00:58:15.375 --> 00:58:18.333
You're beautiful. Sit with us.

00:58:18.416 --> 00:58:19.750
Take a seat.

00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:23.500
-Fadly, this is my daughter.
-[chuckling awkwardly]

00:58:23.583 --> 00:58:24.375
See?

00:58:24.458 --> 00:58:25.166
Fadly.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:26.541
Sri.

00:58:26.625 --> 00:58:27.458
Hi.

00:58:27.541 --> 00:58:30.000
Why? Are you confused?

00:58:31.166 --> 00:58:35.458
Sorry. That photo I sent you
was from ten years ago.

00:58:35.541 --> 00:58:36.416
[Fatimah] Oh.

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:39.208
[Ina] Sri is my stepdaughter.

00:58:39.291 --> 00:58:41.625
She's a bit shy,

00:58:41.708 --> 00:58:43.791
so she doesn't have any recent pictures.

00:58:43.875 --> 00:58:46.625
-Fatimah, let's talk out the back.
-Yes?

00:58:46.708 --> 00:58:49.583
Let Fadly and Sri get to know each other.

00:58:50.375 --> 00:58:54.125
-[hums] Are you getting shy?
-No, I'm good. You can stay.

00:58:54.208 --> 00:58:56.625
It's okay, Fadly. Go talk to her.

00:58:56.708 --> 00:58:58.541
Don't go too long, Mom.
Dad needs his meds.

00:58:58.625 --> 00:59:00.750
[Fatimah] Okay, okay.

00:59:02.208 --> 00:59:04.541
-[sighs]
-[witty music]

00:59:04.625 --> 00:59:05.458
[chuckles]

00:59:08.708 --> 00:59:09.750
Help yourself.

00:59:16.291 --> 00:59:18.250
Such a classic taste.

00:59:18.333 --> 00:59:21.500
-[Fatimah] Peace be upon you.
-[both] And upon you peace.

00:59:21.583 --> 00:59:23.125
[Fatimah] What are you making?

00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:25.750
-Wedding invitations. Check it out.
-[Fatimah] Oh.

00:59:25.833 --> 00:59:26.875
[Fatimah] I love the colors.

00:59:26.958 --> 00:59:28.333
How did it go?

00:59:29.083 --> 00:59:30.625
How did it go?

00:59:31.541 --> 00:59:33.125
Ask Mom.

00:59:33.208 --> 00:59:34.791
[chuckles]

00:59:34.875 --> 00:59:37.000
Don't be mad at me.

00:59:37.541 --> 00:59:38.625
Smile.

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:40.208
Mom.

00:59:40.291 --> 00:59:42.916
-[chuckles]
-What happened?

00:59:43.791 --> 00:59:46.958
First of all, there's a huge age gap.

00:59:47.041 --> 00:59:50.791
Secondly, the photo Aunt Ina sent me

00:59:50.875 --> 00:59:53.875
was from ten years ago.
[exclaims quietly]

00:59:53.958 --> 00:59:55.750
So it's a no?

00:59:55.833 --> 00:59:56.833
Of course not.

00:59:56.916 --> 00:59:58.000
No way.

00:59:58.625 --> 00:59:59.416
Why?

00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.875
You're being reckless.

01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:01.750
What?

01:00:01.833 --> 01:00:04.666
You think it doesn't bother us that
you haven't found someone?

01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:06.916
All you care about is yourself.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.083
Why me?

01:00:09.166 --> 01:00:12.166
Karin's mad that
we haven't done the invitations

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:14.583
and the prewedding photos.

01:00:16.583 --> 01:00:18.583
Then you go and say something like that?

01:00:18.666 --> 01:00:20.083
It's not my fault.

01:00:20.791 --> 01:00:23.000
I did what Dad wanted.

01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:26.875
He told me to just meet her,
not that it had to work out.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:28.791
You still blame me?

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.958
Go ahead and take prewedding photos.

01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:32.125
Don't wait for me.

01:00:32.208 --> 01:00:35.250
That's enough.

01:00:35.333 --> 01:00:36.791
-You too, Ahmad.
-Huh?

01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:39.125
Do your own thing. Don't wait for anyone.

01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:42.125
Why take it out on me? I've been quiet.

01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:44.833
Because everything here is my fault.

01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:47.791
No one's blaming you.

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:48.875
[sighs]

01:00:50.958 --> 01:00:54.666
How could you speak like that
to your brother?

01:00:55.291 --> 01:00:57.000
You were out of line.

01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:01.250
Mom, I didn't say anything.

01:01:01.333 --> 01:01:03.125
[Asha] My Dad is nagging me.

01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:05.583
There's not much time left.

01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:07.750
We have to send the invitations.

01:01:07.833 --> 01:01:10.083
[somber music]

01:01:23.666 --> 01:01:25.375
[sighs]

01:01:30.916 --> 01:01:38.875
HI RIFA, HOW ARE YOU?

01:01:41.833 --> 01:01:44.958
[phone buzzing]

01:01:56.333 --> 01:01:57.625
[Nisa] Fadly.

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:00.500
I miss you.

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:03.416
I didn't want to be in this position.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.375
Can you stop contacting me?

01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:08.625
Your brother came to my studio
the other day.

01:02:09.083 --> 01:02:12.333
[sniffles] I'm sorry.

01:02:12.416 --> 01:02:14.750
I told him to stay away from you.

01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:18.041
Let's meet up and talk.

01:02:18.125 --> 01:02:19.708
You can say it now.

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.041
I have to see you.

01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:24.166
It won't take long.

01:02:25.666 --> 01:02:27.541
I'll go to Makassar tomorrow.

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:29.541
[sighs]

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:32.916
[somber music]

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.875
I've missed you.

01:02:55.166 --> 01:02:56.583
What do you want to say?

01:03:00.833 --> 01:03:02.125
I can't stay long.

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:06.583
Take me away, Fadly.

01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:08.041
[deep breaths]

01:03:11.083 --> 01:03:12.250
What can I do?

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:19.083
We don't know if we don't try.

01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:21.375
It's too late, Nisa.

01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:22.875
No, Fadly.

01:03:23.458 --> 01:03:24.916
It's not too late.

01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:29.041
I admit I was wrong,
but it's not my fault.

01:03:29.125 --> 01:03:31.000
I want to fight for us.

01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:33.333
I won't give up easily.

01:03:33.416 --> 01:03:34.833
We can't.

01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:39.500
Doing that will just enrage our families.

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.291
Why are you being a coward?

01:03:46.708 --> 01:03:47.750
Is this it?

01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:50.250
You call this love?

01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:54.250
You won't even fight for our relationship.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.458
So the past three years
mean nothing to you?

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.291
Maybe the saying is true.

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:09.750
Being together a long time
doesn't mean true love.

01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:13.583
[somber music]

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.416
Is it really love
if you don't fight for it?

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.458
You're not a real man.

01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:32.458
[Nisa sighs]

01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:50.958
[sings lines of sad love song teasingly]

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:01.833
It's not like that, sir.

01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:05.000
My mind's a bit blank right now.

01:05:06.166 --> 01:05:08.541
I can't come up with anything for a song.

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:15.083
Look at that.

01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:20.708
Falling in love is a choice, Fadly.

01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:24.708
But it's not just about choosing,

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:29.375
it's about the responsibility
that comes with it.

01:05:31.875 --> 01:05:33.625
God's plan

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.875
is never wrong.

01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:40.958
What disappoints us

01:05:41.041 --> 01:05:44.500
isn't the wrong choice,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.208
but our late realization
of the purpose behind it.

01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:52.708
[solemn music]

01:05:56.083 --> 01:05:59.166
Love enters through the eyes
and settles in the heart.

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:00.291
[knocking]

01:06:00.375 --> 01:06:02.666
[video continues indistinctly]

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.000
Come in.

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:09.333
Here's your drink.

01:06:09.416 --> 01:06:11.583
-Okay, thank you.
-No problem.

01:06:14.166 --> 01:06:15.000
Aunty.

01:06:15.708 --> 01:06:17.041
Where are you going?

01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:18.291
The kitchen.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:22.125
No, stay here with me. I'm bored.

01:06:22.208 --> 01:06:24.333
[chuckles] Oh, sure.

01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:26.791
Come here.

01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:28.958
Don't just stand there, come here.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.125
Excuse me.

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:33.208
It's okay. Sit here.

01:06:33.291 --> 01:06:35.166
[laughing]

01:06:37.125 --> 01:06:38.625
That's hilarious.

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:42.375
Don't feel "insesoh."

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:46.041
It should've been "insechure."

01:06:46.791 --> 01:06:47.625
Insecure?

01:06:47.708 --> 01:06:49.083
Insecure.

01:06:49.166 --> 01:06:52.291
You know your English well.

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:54.000
[laughing]

01:06:56.541 --> 01:06:58.083
Oops.

01:06:58.166 --> 01:06:59.375
I got carried away.

01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:00.625
It's okay.

01:07:00.708 --> 01:07:01.916
[in thick accent] I lost control.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.250
[laughing]

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:05.875
It's good.

01:07:05.958 --> 01:07:07.250
[man on video speaking]

01:07:07.333 --> 01:07:09.791
-Look at this. It's viral.
-Yeah.

01:07:09.875 --> 01:07:14.541
This guy blew up online.
It's getting millions of views.

01:07:15.291 --> 01:07:18.250
…because the dowry was crazy expensive.

01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:20.791
She was an only child of a rich family.

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:24.125
It makes sense
why the dowry was that much.

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:26.083
It was one…

01:07:26.166 --> 01:07:27.916
One billion, not a million.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.625
-One billion.
-One billion.

01:07:29.708 --> 01:07:31.208
-Aunty.
-Yes?

01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:33.791
What about me?

01:07:34.666 --> 01:07:36.333
As for you…

01:07:36.416 --> 01:07:39.666
You have a master's degree,
have undertaken Umrah,

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:44.208
and are an only child
inheriting your father's housing business.

01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:45.708
[exclaims]

01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:47.625
Your dowry should be
at least three billion.

01:07:47.708 --> 01:07:49.291
What? Three billion?

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:50.125
That's too expensive.

01:07:50.208 --> 01:07:52.458
But that price is reasonable.

01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:55.250
Imagine a football player. You know Messi?

01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:58.125
Do you think he'd be paid
with Ngawi's minimum wage?

01:07:58.208 --> 01:07:59.250
Definitely not.

01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:00.583
I guess so.

01:08:00.666 --> 01:08:03.541
Unless Messi is okay with that pay.

01:08:03.625 --> 01:08:05.750
That's another story.

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:12.166
I never noticed how much you know.

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:14.750
From football to minimum wage.

01:08:14.833 --> 01:08:15.750
[chuckles]

01:08:15.833 --> 01:08:17.875
I don't mean to brag,

01:08:17.958 --> 01:08:20.916
but this is just who I am.

01:08:21.458 --> 01:08:22.625
[chuckles]

01:08:22.708 --> 01:08:26.916
Even though I'm from the countryside,
we must always stay informed.

01:08:27.458 --> 01:08:29.000
Especially about mental health.

01:08:29.083 --> 01:08:29.916
[chuckles]

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.416
It's important. Programs on TV say so too.

01:08:34.625 --> 01:08:37.708
I have some advice for you

01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:39.291
about finding a partner.

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:41.500
Don't take it the wrong way,

01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:43.583
but in my opinion…

01:08:43.666 --> 01:08:47.041
What's the South Jakarta slang for it?

01:08:47.125 --> 01:08:49.208
Don't be too picky.

01:08:49.708 --> 01:08:53.208
Just make sure the guy
isn't full of red flags.

01:08:53.291 --> 01:08:57.291
Just choose one. Otherwise,
it'll be hard to find a match.

01:08:57.375 --> 01:09:01.583
As for me, I'd accept whoever comes along.

01:09:01.666 --> 01:09:03.041
But the problem is, no one's coming.

01:09:03.125 --> 01:09:03.916
[Karin's mom] Dear.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:04.958
Yes, Mom?

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:08.000
What about the invitation?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.416
Are they going to be ready to go

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.833
before your prewedding trip to Makassar?

01:09:15.916 --> 01:09:20.791
The neighbors and our family
keep asking about it.

01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:23.375
[Asha] Babe.

01:09:23.458 --> 01:09:26.666
When can we send the invitations?

01:09:29.625 --> 01:09:32.041
Just wait, babe. Be patient.

01:09:33.625 --> 01:09:35.000
Let's wait

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:38.583
for Fadly to find someone new.

01:09:38.666 --> 01:09:40.166
When will that be?

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.541
My parents keep asking about it.

01:09:43.166 --> 01:09:44.250
[somber music]

01:09:44.333 --> 01:09:46.208
Do you want to cancel the wedding?

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.625
Fadly, have you decided?

01:09:51.916 --> 01:09:53.000
Yeah.

01:09:53.083 --> 01:09:55.375
My future in-laws won't stop asking,

01:09:55.875 --> 01:09:57.333
and I'm out of excuses.

01:09:59.041 --> 01:10:00.416
You don't seem worried.

01:10:03.708 --> 01:10:04.916
Just wait.

01:10:05.666 --> 01:10:07.291
[heavy sigh]

01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:08.666
Until when?

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:15.000
Why didn't you accept the match
Mom set up?

01:10:16.416 --> 01:10:18.666
Just pick someone already.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.916
Don't let your indecision

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.958
ruin your brothers' chances
to get married.

01:10:25.625 --> 01:10:27.250
Are you blaming me?

01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:29.166
You think I wanted this?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:30.833
Huh?

01:10:32.125 --> 01:10:35.000
You think you can handle my situation?

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.833
It's clearly your fault.

01:10:37.916 --> 01:10:41.583
Why'd you say yes to Dad
if Nisa wasn't available?

01:10:41.666 --> 01:10:43.541
Why are you putting this on me, Ahmad?

01:10:43.625 --> 01:10:45.250
Why don't you blame Dad?

01:10:45.958 --> 01:10:47.833
He's the one who wanted
a joint wedding, not me!

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.375
-Fadly watch your mouth.
-Hey.

Ahmad.

-You want to blame Dad?
-Ahmad.

01:10:53.208 --> 01:10:54.416
What?

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:56.208
You're taking his side now?

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.541
You want to call off the wedding?

01:11:00.166 --> 01:11:02.208
You think this isn't bothering me too?

01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:04.083
This affects all of us.

01:11:04.583 --> 01:11:05.750
Listen.

01:11:06.458 --> 01:11:09.333
If one of us backs out, we all go down.

01:11:10.166 --> 01:11:11.416
Go ahead, I don't want to.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.166
-You're so selfish, Ahmad.
-What did you say?

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:16.333
-Watch your mouth.
-Go on, hit me!

01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:19.416
Fadly, you'd better go.

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:24.208
I have to take care of my wedding,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.416
and now him?

01:11:31.416 --> 01:11:33.583
I'm sure he's trying his best.

01:11:33.666 --> 01:11:36.208
But it can't be helped
if he hasn't found his soulmate.

01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:38.416
We can't just wait around.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.250
We're out of time.

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:44.916
I understand.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.833
You, me, and Fadly,
we all hate this situation.

01:11:49.583 --> 01:11:50.666
Ahmad.

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:54.291
We have to support Fadly.

[sighs]

01:11:57.958 --> 01:12:01.458
Rifa, what about your PhD?

01:12:01.541 --> 01:12:03.083
Which university?

01:12:07.541 --> 01:12:09.666
I'm good, Mom.

01:12:12.875 --> 01:12:13.708
Huh?

01:12:14.083 --> 01:12:18.708
Many of your friends
chose to study abroad.

01:12:18.791 --> 01:12:20.416
Are you not going?

01:12:20.833 --> 01:12:23.625
We don't have to do everything others do.

01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:27.916
She doesn't want her dowry to cost more.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.333
[Rifa's mom] Surti.

01:12:29.416 --> 01:12:32.958
My daughter's dowry
should be three billion.

[Surti] Oops.
I didn't mean to drink yours.

01:12:35.083 --> 01:12:37.625
I think I need some healing.

Wait, I'll get you a new one.

01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:45.416
You're coming with me
to Aunty Rika's, right?

01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:48.500
All your aunts will be there.

01:12:48.583 --> 01:12:49.833
I'd rather not.

01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:52.875
They'll bombard me with questions.

01:12:53.541 --> 01:12:56.333
When am I getting married,
why don't I have a boyfriend,

01:12:56.416 --> 01:12:59.541
why don't I like this guy or that guy…

01:13:01.625 --> 01:13:02.916
Okay.

You don't have to come.

Is this the reason you won't fight for us?

Huh? Fight for what?

Our families have a love just as strong

01:31:24.208 --> 01:31:26.375
that deserves our fight.

01:31:29.666 --> 01:31:30.708
Go home.

01:31:32.958 --> 01:31:35.083
Let's move on with our lives.

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:40.375
No one can leave
the past behind that fast.

01:31:40.458 --> 01:31:43.000
But sometimes, that's what we have to do

01:31:44.333 --> 01:31:46.666
for the people we love.

01:31:51.291 --> 01:31:52.375

Not very often,

you wanted to meet

Yeah?

Are you proposing

01:35:20.916 --> 01:35:23.166
because you truly want to,

01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.208
or because of circumstances?

I understand what you're thinking,

01:35:42.458 --> 01:35:46.791
but it's really hard for me to explain

01:35:47.791 --> 01:35:52.708
that I do want to marry you
despite everything.

01:35:56.166 --> 01:35:57.916
How can I be sure

01:35:58.958 --> 01:36:01.500
that you've moved on from your ex?

01:36:15.250 --> 01:36:17.166
I have no explanation

or proof that will be able to satisfy you…

Who could have imagined that

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:40.791
we'd be in this messy situation?

01:36:42.833 --> 01:36:45.958
Rifa, this is beyond my control.

01:36:48.833 --> 01:36:49.916
To be honest…

01:36:55.125 --> 01:36:57.416
I do have feelings for you.

But also…

I haven't seen you change.

You're still the same coward as before.

[Fatimah] I know this is hard for you.

Right?
