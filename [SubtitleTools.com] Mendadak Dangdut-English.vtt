WEBVTT

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:48.041
Thank you!

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:52.900
Encore, encore, encore!

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:54.667
- Encore, encore, encore!
- I love you, Naya!

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:02.291
Thank you.

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:08.166
A MUSICIAN AND A SONGWRITER.
PERFECTIONIST, BLUNT, AND ANTI-DRAMA.

00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:09.791
Sweetheart.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.916
What is this?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.666
For your performance
earlier. You killed it.

00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:19.083
Oh, dear. Your eyes look weird.
What did you do?

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:21.458
- What are you talking about?
- Miss... Thank you.

00:02:21.922 --> 00:02:22.516
Thank you.

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:23.791
Bring it to her room.

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:25.208
I told you I quit.

00:02:25.893 --> 00:02:26.917
Where's Lola?

00:02:28.196 --> 00:02:29.321
Your little sister?

00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:32.844
Of course! How many Lola we have in our
team?

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:34.986
How could you ask something like that?

00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:38.541
Nay, the audience asks for an encore.

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:41.250
Ask Thomas to sing. I won't do it.

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:44.083
The contract only states
that I sing several songs. So, no.

00:02:44.344 --> 00:02:47.750
Encore, encore, encore!

00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:53.083
Sir, where's Naya? What should we do?

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:55.875
- Sir, I talked to Naya.
- Yes?

00:02:55.916 --> 00:02:58.791
She won't sing another song.

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:00.625
The contract only requires
her to sing five songs.

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:02.792
Nay.

00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:05.583
Babe.

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:08.583
Babe? I'm not your babe.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.333
Nay, there's someone here.

00:03:13.791 --> 00:03:14.900
Meet...

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:17.416
Uncle Joni.

00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:20.042
Yes, I know.

00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:21.792
Joni Halmalisa?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.791
- Right.
- Yes.

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:25.750
A LEGENDARY MUSICIAN.
FOUNDER OF THE BATAVIA MELODIES.

00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:29.916
A member of The Batavia Melodies...

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.791
...from 1976 to 1982.

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:36.791
It's 1984.

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:40.666
But thank you for still remembering me
and liking my songs.

00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:43.333
It's my mom who actually liked you.

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:46.000
- Please, take a seat.
- Okay.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:49.141
What do you want?
We have snacks, tea...

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:52.541
- Water is good.
- Water, Thomas.

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:53.875
So, Nay,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.503
Uncle Joni wants to make a
comeback to the music industry.

00:03:57.625 --> 00:04:00.166
To pay for the electricity bill back home.

00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:03.077
Nay, I have an idea.

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:05.041
- Come here, Uncle. Sorry.
- Yeah, okay.

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:10.308
I want to combine an old legend...

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.766
...and a future legend.

00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:15.000
Joni and Naya.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.483
Here's the thing, Nay.

00:04:25.791 --> 00:04:30.791
We're going to remake
my song called "Your Way".

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:35.416
I will try to make a new
modern arrangement for it.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.333
Come with me, Uncle.

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:47.916
You played it in the key of E, right?
The original was in the key of C, right?

00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:49.125
That's right, Naya.

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:52.791
I raise the key on purpose
to match your vocal range.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.375
Personally, I have no problem with that.
But does it match your vocal range?

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.416
Now, that's it!

00:06:25.916 --> 00:06:33.875
This beautiful song was written
by the living legend, Joni Halmalisa.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.625
Carry on.

00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:13.791
You two can see it yourselves.

00:07:13.953 --> 00:07:19.119
I can sing any song, better than anyone.

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:23.125
I don't need anyone. Do you understand?

00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:24.792
Do you understand that too?

00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:31.442
What did you do? Idiot.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.400
Honestly, I'm fed up with Thomas.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.833
I think he's still using drugs.

00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:45.291
You should arrange the meeting
with Mr. Indra immediately.

00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:49.166
It should've been done a long time ago.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.750
Mr. Indra is a greater
producer than Thomas.

00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.067
So, make it happen, then.

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:56.875
- Naya.
- Looks like really hard.

00:07:57.112 --> 00:07:59.266
I have important news.

00:07:59.393 --> 00:08:00.750
Where have you been?

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:04.541
NAYA'S LITTLE SISTER AND ASSISTANT.
SPONTANEOUS, CLUMSY, ANIMAL LOVER.

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:06.541
I have important news.

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:08.875
What?

00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.583
It's important.

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.666
Is there something more
important than your work here?

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.125
What are you doing now?

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:20.292
If I say something, don't get mad.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.067
Promise me you won't get mad.

00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:23.900
I won't! Move!

00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:25.916
Move.

00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:34.233
Dad?

00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:51.625
Naya, Dad is ill.

00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:53.292
Are you ill?

00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:56.500
You must need money.

00:08:58.416 --> 00:09:02.375
I'm shocked to see you here.

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:06.041
So, you come here because
you need money, right?

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:09.166
Wait here for a while,
Dad. La, come with me.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.750
- What?
- Take him to the ATM.

00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:15.667
After that,

00:09:15.704 --> 00:09:17.100
- give him money to go home. Here.
- ATM?

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:19.000
- Why?
- He needs money.

00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:21.833
- He's ill. He's...
- Take this.

00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:24.875
- He's...
- Don't be selfish.

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:29.208
His wife should be the one
who takes care of him. Got it?

00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:30.750
Okay?

00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:33.041
Come on, Dad.

00:09:37.416 --> 00:09:41.291
Keep healthy, Dad.
Don't forget to eat. Sleep well.

00:09:41.316 --> 00:09:42.067
Hey!

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.083
That's my car!

00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:48.750
He remembers his car.

00:09:52.416 --> 00:09:56.192
Yes, this is the one
you left for us to keep.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.291
I haven't got the chance to thank you.

00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:01.541
Because you left in a hurry.

00:10:03.291 --> 00:10:04.625
Naya...

00:10:04.666 --> 00:10:07.291
Okay, then. I'm going back in.

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:08.541
- I have another job.
- Wait...

00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:11.500
- Take care of your health.
- What job?

00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:13.416
- Take him.
- Naya...

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.650
Naya!

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:17.108
Dad, wait here for a minute, okay?

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:18.400
Naya.

00:10:19.103 --> 00:10:20.170
Do you hear me?

00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:22.358
Naya.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.625
Dad was dumped by his wife.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.291
Dumped?

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:40.942
Dad was dumped?

00:10:43.541 --> 00:10:47.233
His wife dropped him at a nursing home.

00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:49.400
Here.

00:10:49.875 --> 00:10:51.666
She sent this letter.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.483
She said she couldn't
take care of him anymore.

00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:02.416
This is a lesson for you, little sister.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.041
When you choose a life partner,
what should you do?

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.083
You should be careful.

00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:12.167
Naya.

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:24.583
Nay?

00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:28.208
Nay, what's wrong?

00:11:32.416 --> 00:11:33.500
What do you need?

00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:35.125
I just need to be alone.

00:11:36.666 --> 00:11:39.000
Sorry about Uncle Joni.

00:11:39.041 --> 00:11:41.000
I was just trying to do my best.

00:11:43.109 --> 00:11:44.416
For your sake, too.

00:11:46.416 --> 00:11:47.400
Drink this.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.567
To avoid dehydration.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.733
I need to leave.

00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:13.666
Your mom and I have too much difference.

00:12:18.916 --> 00:12:23.666
Dad!

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.541
Don't leave me!

00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:04.317
Help!

00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:05.900
Help!

00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:09.608
Help!

00:13:15.166 --> 00:13:16.541
Oh, dear! Zul!

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.875
- What did you do to Zul? Hey!
- Nothing.

00:13:22.916 --> 00:13:25.791
- What did you do to Zul?
- Nothing.

00:13:25.916 --> 00:13:28.291
- Zul is dead, Naya!
- I did nothing, Thomas!

00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:31.291
I was down there, asleep! I didn't know!

00:13:31.375 --> 00:13:34.125
- I'm innocent.
- Your clothes are covered in blood!

00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:46.041
Why can't I remember anything?

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.166
Naya? What happened?

00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:49.666
I don't know!

00:13:49.791 --> 00:13:51.791
- Naya, what happened?
- I don't know!

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:56.291
I can't remember anything.

00:13:56.529 --> 00:13:57.630
Calm down.

00:13:57.655 --> 00:13:59.306
- Do you remember what happened?
- No.

00:13:59.541 --> 00:14:01.458
No, I don't.

00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:03.375
Naya, you must've done something.

00:14:03.416 --> 00:14:04.916
Who else was here, Lola?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.250
Why are you slandering her like that?

00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:07.791
- Please, Lola.
- What to remember?

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:09.916
- Try remember...
- She said it wasn't her doing!

00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:11.344
Zul is dead!

00:14:12.125 --> 00:14:14.041
How can she not
remember that Zul died here?

00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:17.416
It's not my doing, Thomas.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.041
- Try to remember.
- I can't.

00:14:19.166 --> 00:14:21.791
- Naya, no!
- No! I can't!

00:14:21.916 --> 00:14:24.375
- Where are you going?
- I can't be here, Thomas.

00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:26.666
- I can't be here.
- No. Let's call the police first.

00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:28.592
No! You're going to
report me to the police?

00:14:28.616 --> 00:14:30.416
Are you crazy? You
earn your living from me!

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.166
- Everyone, calm down!
- It's a freaking crime scene!

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.416
Everyone, calm down! Can you do that?

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.541
No!

00:14:36.666 --> 00:14:38.416
- I can't be here.
- Naya.

00:14:38.541 --> 00:14:40.375
- Naya!
- No!

00:14:40.416 --> 00:14:42.416
No!

00:14:42.541 --> 00:14:44.250
No, I can't.

00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:46.541
Don't... Naya!

00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:47.791
Naya!

00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:49.166
Naya, wait.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.166
Listen to me first! Naya!

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.916
- Naya.
- Move, Dad.

00:14:53.041 --> 00:14:54.500
- Let Lola drive.
- Okay.

00:14:58.291 --> 00:15:00.541
Lola, why is Dad here?

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:03.416
You told me to give back the ATM first,
then take him home.

00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:07.416
Get in, hurry. I don't want to be here.
I want to leave. Hurry!

00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:08.541
Where do we go?

00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:10.500
- Just away from here. Can we just go?
- Okay, okay.

00:15:45.416 --> 00:15:47.542
Come on. Let's go home.

00:15:48.166 --> 00:15:49.916
Your mom is waiting.

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:53.041
Mom? What is he talking about?

00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:54.525
Whose blood is that?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.916
The person who was
stabbed early this evening?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.416
- Huh?
- Wait. Dad.

00:16:00.791 --> 00:16:03.375
- The person who was stabbed early this evening?
- Did you see it?

00:16:03.625 --> 00:16:07.166
Was the person tall? How did they look?

00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:14.916
How did they look? The stabber
and the one who was stabbed?

00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:18.625
- How did the person look like?
- Please, Dad.

00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:22.041
If you know anything, tell me, please.

00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:24.666
- Mr. Thomas.
- Sir!

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.666
Enough. Enough for today.

00:16:26.791 --> 00:16:28.750
And I want to advise Naya...

00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:30.375
Please, come home.

00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:32.541
And to all Indonesian people...

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:34.750
...if you know Naya's whereabout...

00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:36.166
...please report it.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:40.291
You know, then. Please, tell me.
The clothes, what did the person wear?

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.000
Naya, Dad is ill.

00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:48.625
What is his illness?

00:16:50.541 --> 00:16:51.791
Alzheimer.

00:16:53.916 --> 00:16:54.608
Huh?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.791
I will reward ten million rupiah in cash
for the information.

00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:03.541
Why didn't you tell me?

00:17:03.666 --> 00:17:06.291
I wanted to tell you, but you scolded me.

00:17:06.375 --> 00:17:08.750
We need to go to the
pharmacy to get some medicine.

00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:10.291
Alzheimer isn't like flu.

00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:14.791
But still, there must be some medicine.
Just look for it on Google or something.

00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:20.000
Did you really see it?

00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:21.666
I have a bad feeling.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.375
Thomas is very suspicious.

00:17:24.416 --> 00:17:27.041
To you, everyone is suspicious.

00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:30.541
Seriously, I really have
a bad feeling this time.

00:17:30.625 --> 00:17:33.291
Why would Thomas say that to the media?

00:17:33.416 --> 00:17:35.666
Being an attention-seeker
isn't against the law, you know.

00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:41.416
You really saw someone getting stabbed?

00:17:41.541 --> 00:17:43.666
Please, Dad, try to remember.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.166
"A familiar environment."

00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:55.000
"An Alzheimer's patient's memory
can be improved by a familiar environment."

00:17:58.541 --> 00:18:01.291
Dad, where did you live
before the nursing home?

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:08.041
Seriously, he can't even
remember where he lived?

00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:11.041
Your ID. Ask for his ID.

00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:14.900
Singalaya.

00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:18.291
That's...

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:25.125
My beautiful audience!

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:28.291
Why do you answer me? You're not beautiful!

00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:30.041
Don't go home just yet...

00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:34.041
...because Tata will open herself!

00:18:35.125 --> 00:18:37.666
Hey! Somad is here!

00:18:37.791 --> 00:18:39.166
Hey, Somad!

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.666
Give us some tip money...

00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:43.541
...since your wife just
got back from Malaysia.

00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:45.416
Hey!

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:47.416
For Tata.

00:18:47.541 --> 00:18:48.791
Only 5 thousand?

00:18:48.916 --> 00:18:51.291
Don't you have anything less?

00:18:51.375 --> 00:18:53.625
Come home!

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:55.541
How could you tip them?

00:18:59.666 --> 00:19:01.875
Sir, excuse me.

00:19:02.916 --> 00:19:03.900
Yes?

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.416
Do you know where Mrs. Lastri lives?

00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:08.041
Which one is Mrs. Lastri?

00:19:08.166 --> 00:19:09.817
Mrs. Lastri, Mr. Anwar's wife.

00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:12.041
- This is Mr. Anwar.
- He's Mr. Anwar.

00:19:12.125 --> 00:19:15.041
I have the address. You can look at it.

00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:20.541
Oh, this man.

00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:24.375
His house... Just go straight,
go pass a dangdut show...

00:19:24.416 --> 00:19:26.291
...go straight until you reach the end,
then turn right.

00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:33.375
Give a round of applause to Tata!

00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:38.666
Make some noise for Tata!

00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:43.916
Give her encouragement!

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.291
Tata!

00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:35.000
Forget the price of rice!

00:20:42.166 --> 00:20:43.166
Geez!

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.125
Ria Buana!

00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:54.125
Ria Buana!

00:20:58.291 --> 00:21:00.125
Where did you learn that?

00:21:04.916 --> 00:21:06.166
Hey!

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.916
Stop messing around!

00:21:08.992 --> 00:21:09.924
Sit!

00:21:10.151 --> 00:21:11.055
Calm down.

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:13.916
What are you doing? You can't just do that.

00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:15.541
Go on!

00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:17.416
She can't do that.

00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:40.916
Is this really the house?

00:21:41.041 --> 00:21:43.541
According to his ID, this is it.

00:21:43.625 --> 00:21:46.291
Melati Street number 20, this is the house.

00:21:53.416 --> 00:21:55.291
THIS HOUSE IS FOR SALE

00:21:58.791 --> 00:22:00.625
The door is locked.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.291
Why are we here?

00:22:04.416 --> 00:22:05.791
I want to go home!

00:22:05.986 --> 00:22:07.611
This is your house.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.125
He means our house in Jakarta.

00:22:12.416 --> 00:22:14.750
Your poor mother is waiting!

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.608
She only pities Mom now.

00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:22.525
What about all the time before?

00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:33.041
Lola, we have to live here now!

00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:35.483
We have to bring back his memories...

00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:37.125
...so he can become an eyewitness.

00:22:37.166 --> 00:22:39.500
- Living here...
- We can go home afterward.

00:22:39.541 --> 00:22:43.416
How do we live here? We can't!

00:22:44.666 --> 00:22:45.608
Okay.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.608
Fine if you don't want to live there.

00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:51.625
We sleep in the car, then.

00:22:51.666 --> 00:22:56.916
Are you kidding me? It's more ridiculous.
Where do we sleep?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.291
You know I'm in a complicated situation.

00:23:00.416 --> 00:23:02.891
I only have a small amount of money
in my bank account.

00:23:02.916 --> 00:23:04.775
The rest is in Zul's account.

00:23:05.345 --> 00:23:06.512
What else should we do?

00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:15.375
What are you doing?

00:23:15.875 --> 00:23:17.608
We sleep in the car tonight.

00:23:18.301 --> 00:23:19.542
We'll find a way tomorrow.

00:23:28.416 --> 00:23:30.273
Look at your dad and Tata.

00:23:30.625 --> 00:23:31.958
One is smell like fossil.

00:23:32.666 --> 00:23:34.416
And the other one is smell of gasoline.

00:23:34.555 --> 00:23:37.875
You play the piano for nothing.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.666
- Keyboard.
- No difference there!

00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:41.791
No one cares about your music.

00:23:41.875 --> 00:23:43.875
Your music only accompany Tata's dance.

00:23:43.916 --> 00:23:47.000
How could he prefer
a young, sexy, and beautiful widow...

00:23:47.041 --> 00:23:49.166
...than his son
who is a hassle and rarely showers?

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.541
Words come out so easily from your mouth.
Did you just eat papaya?

00:23:51.625 --> 00:23:53.583
Do you think my mouth is filled with shit?

00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:56.541
But you have a point.

00:23:56.666 --> 00:23:59.541
People don't appreciate my musicality here.

00:23:59.666 --> 00:24:01.166
Should I just quit?

00:24:02.416 --> 00:24:04.666
And then I form my own orchestra.

00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:06.375
Can I be your gendang player?

00:24:06.416 --> 00:24:07.625
What I'm looking for is a singer.

00:24:07.666 --> 00:24:10.541
Wan, I also have a dream.

00:24:10.666 --> 00:24:12.416
You're not the only
one who wants to strive.

00:24:12.541 --> 00:24:14.875
I want to strive, Dhoy.

00:24:14.916 --> 00:24:16.733
That's why I don't want you.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:18.541
It hurts!

00:24:18.625 --> 00:24:21.041
Go home! Stop chatting.

00:24:21.166 --> 00:24:22.791
Go home! It's late.

00:24:22.916 --> 00:24:25.416
Why is Wawan always
blowing up for no reason?

00:24:25.548 --> 00:24:28.000
He's just pissed whenever
he sees you with me.

00:24:28.666 --> 00:24:30.125
Doesn't he have a girlfriend?

00:24:30.166 --> 00:24:32.791
No one likes him.
Even cats turn their backs on him.

00:24:32.875 --> 00:24:34.791
Can't you see his body
only consists of shoulders?

00:24:36.025 --> 00:24:37.150
Really?

00:24:39.916 --> 00:24:42.791
Rio, let's eat together. Stop playing that.

00:24:42.916 --> 00:24:45.750
Here, I cook something
special for you, Babeh.

00:24:45.791 --> 00:24:47.041
You cook all this, Ta?

00:24:47.166 --> 00:24:49.125
Of course!

00:24:49.165 --> 00:24:54.166
I don't doubt your cooking.
Even chickens will be wowed by your cooking.

00:24:55.352 --> 00:24:56.660
- Eat the veggies.
- Okay.

00:24:57.916 --> 00:24:59.916
Hey. Have you brushed your teeth?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.541
If you haven't, when you open your mouth,
flies will be dead.

00:25:02.666 --> 00:25:04.208
Do you think my mouth is a toilet?

00:25:04.416 --> 00:25:06.666
I'll do it later. To save toothpaste.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.500
I bought the toothpaste!

00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:10.791
That's why you should share the tip money.

00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:14.291
It's not much, but you hold on to it.
I can't even buy toothpaste.

00:25:14.416 --> 00:25:16.291
If you can gather a crowd...

00:25:16.416 --> 00:25:18.041
...you don't even have to ask for it,
I will share it with you.

00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:21.583
Why me? Gathering the crowd is Tata's job.

00:25:21.916 --> 00:25:23.083
What do you mean, Wan?

00:25:23.666 --> 00:25:24.667
My job is music.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.666
And your job is to tease men.

00:25:29.166 --> 00:25:31.416
Spit my food out. Spit it out!

00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:34.916
I'm not pleased! I put in all the effort to
cook, but you're the one who finishes it!

00:25:35.041 --> 00:25:36.541
Such a hassle! I'm eating!

00:25:36.666 --> 00:25:39.166
- Give it to me!
- No!

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:40.791
I'm eating!

00:25:40.916 --> 00:25:41.875
Such a hassle!

00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:44.791
I know you always provoke me!

00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:48.041
Hey! Do you think I'm easy
just because I'm a widow?

00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:49.625
Why do you blame me?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.292
You're the one who put a price on yourself!

00:25:52.416 --> 00:25:54.416
See, Babeh?

00:25:55.666 --> 00:25:59.166
Calm down. That's just the way he is.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.375
Calm down.

00:26:00.416 --> 00:26:04.291
No. Wawan never likes me. What did I do?

00:26:04.416 --> 00:26:06.375
You choose.

00:26:06.416 --> 00:26:08.666
Choose him or me.

00:26:09.875 --> 00:26:11.416
This house is so dramatic!

00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:15.291
Babeh!

00:26:15.416 --> 00:26:16.416
Choose!

00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:17.875
Just choose!

00:26:21.416 --> 00:26:22.375
Dhoy?

00:26:26.166 --> 00:26:29.000
Hey, there's a 10
thousand rupiah bill here.

00:26:29.041 --> 00:26:31.041
You satan spawn!

00:26:31.125 --> 00:26:32.408
I've been calling you,
but you didn't come out.

00:26:32.432 --> 00:26:34.166
Yet you come out instantly
when you hear there's money here.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.541
What is this?

00:26:35.666 --> 00:26:36.875
I got kicked out.

00:26:36.916 --> 00:26:38.542
And where are you going to live, Wan?

00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:40.958
What do you think I come here for?

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:42.733
You mean we live together here?

00:26:43.541 --> 00:26:45.875
No way! The neighbors will be talking.

00:26:45.916 --> 00:26:48.192
You said you wanted to join my orchestra.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.000
You can be the gendang player.

00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:53.625
- Seriously, Wan?
- Yes.

00:26:53.666 --> 00:26:55.692
Can there only be a gendang and a piano
in an orchestra?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.567
Relax.

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:59.733
Look at Rizal Maduma.

00:27:00.041 --> 00:27:03.125
They only have a keyboard,
but they're successful!

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.000
My target is to perform at Larung Pes.

00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:09.375
Larung Pes?

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:12.041
It will be held soon.

00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:14.500
Relax. Do you trust me?

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:15.375
No.

00:27:16.791 --> 00:27:17.791
Okay, I trust you.

00:27:17.916 --> 00:27:20.250
Okay, then. There.
Help me bring in the rest.

00:27:21.041 --> 00:27:22.625
Okay? Hurry.

00:27:23.916 --> 00:27:25.291
Hurry up!

00:27:29.891 --> 00:27:30.708
Excuse me.

00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:34.375
Someone there told me
there's a cheap house for rent here?

00:27:34.416 --> 00:27:37.666
There is. Mr. Yatno's house.

00:27:39.041 --> 00:27:40.208
Peace be upon you.

00:27:40.939 --> 00:27:42.689
What place is this?

00:27:43.634 --> 00:27:44.343
Sir?

00:27:45.416 --> 00:27:47.166
Peace be upon you.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.250
Dad.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:54.625
KI YATNO'S HOUSE OF MEDICIN. ALTERNATIVE
HEALTH THERAPY FOR A HARMONIOUS HOUSEHOLD.

00:27:57.416 --> 00:27:59.000
Sir?

00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:01.541
Peace be upon you.

00:28:01.625 --> 00:28:03.167
Where is he?

00:28:03.744 --> 00:28:05.744
Peace be upon you.

00:28:06.791 --> 00:28:08.416
Peace be upon you.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.166
Peace be upon you too.

00:28:11.625 --> 00:28:13.250
You startled us!

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:15.041
We have a guest here.

00:28:15.166 --> 00:28:19.666
Hi. I'm Yatno.
The owner of the rental house.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.416
- Lola.
- Lola.

00:28:23.666 --> 00:28:26.291
Why... Why does she look familiar?

00:28:26.375 --> 00:28:27.525
But where do I know her?

00:28:28.166 --> 00:28:29.791
- What are you looking for?
- A rental house.

00:28:29.916 --> 00:28:31.916
Don't you want to insert a talisman
while you're at it?

00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:33.541
I can also do make-up for brides, you know.

00:28:33.666 --> 00:28:34.916
I just don't put it on the front.

00:28:35.041 --> 00:28:36.500
I CAN MAKE AND EXTEND DRIVER'S LICENSE
AND VEHICLE REGISTRATION.

00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:39.167
Can you deepen a well?

00:28:41.125 --> 00:28:45.375
Not only I can dig a well,
I also have a custom perfume.

00:28:45.416 --> 00:28:46.942
With the scent of musk flower.

00:28:47.166 --> 00:28:49.541
Clothes. What kind? I have them all.

00:28:49.666 --> 00:28:51.500
- Just look.
- Do you have men's clothes?

00:28:51.541 --> 00:28:53.541
I can even prepare the men.

00:28:53.625 --> 00:28:55.250
Just pick the type you want.

00:28:55.291 --> 00:28:58.250
Let's just see the rental house.

00:28:58.291 --> 00:28:59.291
My dad's tired.

00:28:59.416 --> 00:29:00.541
- Your dad?
- Yes.

00:29:00.666 --> 00:29:03.666
Be careful. Come on,
Sir. Take it easy. Slowly.

00:29:03.776 --> 00:29:04.958
- Watch your steps.
- What the...

00:29:05.104 --> 00:29:06.541
What a freak.

00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:14.000
The murder case involving a talented
24-year old young star, Naya Wardhani...

00:29:14.041 --> 00:29:15.375
...is still ongoing.

00:29:15.416 --> 00:29:19.541
There's still no official statement
from Naya or her attorney.

00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:25.375
But Naya's manager, Thomas, has
promised a reward of 10 million rupiah...

00:29:25.416 --> 00:29:30.041
- ...to whoever gives an information of her whereabout.
- Ten million rupiah, Dhoy. That's a lot.

00:29:36.041 --> 00:29:38.666
She has a good voice. Too bad.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.791
And this woman's pretty too.

00:29:42.166 --> 00:29:43.567
Stop running!

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.500
Whose kids are they? So disobedient.

00:29:45.541 --> 00:29:46.625
People's kids.

00:29:46.666 --> 00:29:48.108
How could it be a monkey's baby.

00:29:48.666 --> 00:29:50.875
This one is rented.

00:29:50.916 --> 00:29:52.666
This one too.

00:30:09.291 --> 00:30:11.541
...have to help each other.

00:30:11.666 --> 00:30:13.791
Selling veggies? I hope it sells well.

00:30:13.916 --> 00:30:16.291
But is it always this noisy here?

00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:17.666
Not really.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:20.000
Turn it off. Turn the music off.

00:30:20.041 --> 00:30:21.667
Like a disassembled keyboard.

00:30:21.709 --> 00:30:23.225
So noisy. What's wrong?

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:28.625
My dad is ill.
He can't live in a noisy environment.

00:30:28.666 --> 00:30:30.208
What illness? Heart problem?

00:30:30.666 --> 00:30:31.917
Alzheimer.

00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:34.750
Alzheimer.

00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:37.333
Hey, that's some kind of Angina Pectoris.

00:30:37.791 --> 00:30:40.291
He can't be in the cold
and he has to eat on time.

00:30:40.416 --> 00:30:41.625
Take care of him.

00:30:42.666 --> 00:30:43.875
Peace be upon you!

00:30:43.916 --> 00:30:46.416
Now, this is your rental house. Come in.

00:30:46.541 --> 00:30:47.375
Come in.

00:30:50.125 --> 00:30:52.791
You get the standard fortuners.

00:30:52.875 --> 00:30:54.791
- Furniture?
- What? For...

00:30:54.875 --> 00:30:58.250
- Furniture.
- Furniture.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.275
What are you looking at, Wan?

00:31:00.541 --> 00:31:02.666
That's the solution of
our life's problem, Dhoy.

00:31:02.791 --> 00:31:04.166
Solution?

00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:09.250
- Let's go in. Come on.
- Come on.

00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:11.750
Hey, come here!

00:31:14.291 --> 00:31:17.125
What do you say, Dad?
Do you like the house?

00:31:17.166 --> 00:31:19.291
It's like a drug house.

00:31:19.416 --> 00:31:20.608
Dad!

00:31:21.416 --> 00:31:23.000
But you have a point.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.541
Why don't we go to your mom's house?

00:31:29.666 --> 00:31:31.750
She's waiting for us, you know.

00:31:41.791 --> 00:31:45.291
You persuade your sister. Come on!

00:31:45.416 --> 00:31:46.916
Persuade her.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.875
Naya cannot leave this area yet.

00:31:50.916 --> 00:31:53.291
She can't go to Jakarta yet.

00:31:53.416 --> 00:31:54.875
So, be patient, okay?

00:31:55.916 --> 00:31:57.041
Why?

00:31:58.125 --> 00:32:03.416
Because of those guys who were fighting
and that stabbing?

00:32:04.416 --> 00:32:05.375
Do you remember?

00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:08.599
- Well...
- Naya!

00:32:08.666 --> 00:32:11.166
He's starting to remember again. Hurry up.

00:32:12.416 --> 00:32:13.654
What?

00:32:17.954 --> 00:32:21.288
I was in the car.

00:32:21.416 --> 00:32:23.042
Our car, Nay.

00:32:33.125 --> 00:32:36.108
Well, at the parking lot...

00:32:36.541 --> 00:32:40.483
...there were two guys,
I think they were fighting.

00:32:41.291 --> 00:32:42.791
Fighting?

00:32:42.916 --> 00:32:46.041
One guy wore a green jacket.

00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:49.233
That's Zul!

00:32:49.916 --> 00:32:54.541
- And then?
- The green jacket guy was stabbed.

00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:56.500
- Stabbed?
- Yes.

00:32:56.541 --> 00:33:01.733
Now, the stabber, what did he look like?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.791
Hang on.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.204
- Oh, dear!
- Just a little detail, Dad.

00:33:10.354 --> 00:33:13.395
What was the color of his clothes?
What did he look like?

00:33:13.541 --> 00:33:14.666
Do you remember?

00:33:21.586 --> 00:33:22.311
Okay, then.

00:33:22.336 --> 00:33:24.291
Dad, you can't remember?

00:33:24.375 --> 00:33:25.416
Okay, then. It's okay.

00:33:25.441 --> 00:33:28.775
Okay, then. It's okay. Just get some rest.

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:34.208
Our decision to go here is right.

00:33:34.541 --> 00:33:38.792
Because his memories improve slowly.

00:33:39.731 --> 00:33:41.129
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:33:42.041 --> 00:33:47.125
There's no official statement so far
from Naya or her attorney.

00:33:47.166 --> 00:33:49.666
Sir, excuse me.
I wanna ask something.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:53.666
The murder case involving
a talented 24-year old young star...

00:33:53.791 --> 00:33:57.375
Whoever gives an
information of her whereabout.

00:33:58.541 --> 00:34:00.750
Naya! Girl!

00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:03.125
Here, the clothes you're asking for.

00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:06.166
Pay at the end of the month,
for the rental house too.

00:34:06.291 --> 00:34:08.666
- Thank you.
- Just choose, Lola.

00:34:11.166 --> 00:34:12.791
Okay, correct.

00:34:12.875 --> 00:34:14.666
Peace be upon you!

00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:16.125
You startled me.

00:34:16.166 --> 00:34:17.625
Sorry.

00:34:17.666 --> 00:34:19.417
I have a business with her.

00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:24.000
Hey, you're Haji Romli's son, right?
What are you doing here?

00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:25.666
I have an info for her.

00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:26.916
What info?

00:34:27.041 --> 00:34:28.041
What info?

00:34:28.125 --> 00:34:29.791
Just talk to me privately.

00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:32.416
Why would I talk privately to you?
Just talk here and now.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.541
I want to talk about
what happened in Jakarta.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.166
What happened in Jakarta?

00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:43.291
What happened?

00:34:43.416 --> 00:34:48.291
- That Jakarta thing?
- Yes.

00:34:48.375 --> 00:34:51.875
But that's just how big cities are.

00:34:51.916 --> 00:34:53.541
It's causing a stir. Right?

00:34:53.689 --> 00:34:54.273
Right?

00:34:54.298 --> 00:34:56.583
That often happens in big cities.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.125
Mur...

00:34:59.291 --> 00:35:00.791
...d...

00:35:02.375 --> 00:35:03.667
Mr. Yatno, just take the money.

00:35:03.761 --> 00:35:05.850
Count it again. If it's not
enough, I'll add it later.

00:35:05.875 --> 00:35:09.416
Be careful there, or else he'll die.

00:35:09.502 --> 00:35:10.495
- That's my friend!
- What are you talking about?

00:35:10.559 --> 00:35:12.125
This woman!

00:35:12.175 --> 00:35:13.391
You're like a guy!

00:35:13.416 --> 00:35:15.416
- What are you talking about?
- Show her, Dhoy!

00:35:16.541 --> 00:35:20.041
If you know Naya's
whereabout, please report it.

00:35:20.166 --> 00:35:26.541
I will reward ten million rupiah
in cash for the information.

00:35:27.666 --> 00:35:29.542
Oh, so that's the way it is?

00:35:29.916 --> 00:35:33.666
You two want to report me to the police and
get ten millions from Thomas? Is that it?

00:35:33.791 --> 00:35:35.791
- No.
- Yes.

00:35:35.916 --> 00:35:37.541
So, what do you want?

00:35:38.791 --> 00:35:41.166
Wendhoy and I are making a dangdut group.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.000
We hope you can join us as the singer
and the guitarist...

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:46.166
...because we want to perform
at the Larung Pes event.

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:52.500
If you're joining us as our singer,
we can protect you here.

00:35:58.041 --> 00:35:59.666
And what if I say no?

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.125
And what if I say no?

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.166
Are you going to report me to the police?

00:36:06.291 --> 00:36:08.541
And then you get ten millions from Thomas?
Is that it?

00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:10.291
- Amen.
- And if I say yes...

00:36:15.375 --> 00:36:19.500
And if I say yes, I'm safe,
you're gonna protect me...

00:36:19.541 --> 00:36:21.750
...and your band gets
a new singer. Is that it?

00:36:21.791 --> 00:36:23.625
Ngorkes.

00:36:23.666 --> 00:36:25.791
Yongkru.

00:36:25.875 --> 00:36:28.833
- Orchestra!
- Enough! I don't care!

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:37.125
You don't care about me,
my sister, nor my dad, then!

00:36:37.166 --> 00:36:38.791
Why would I care about your family?

00:36:40.416 --> 00:36:41.500
Hey!

00:36:41.541 --> 00:36:43.041
It's my only glass!

00:36:43.166 --> 00:36:45.416
Who has only one glass in their life?

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.651
Me. You have to appreciate diversity.
Give it to me.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.042
Listen to me.

00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:53.416
I'd rather be put in jail
than listening to dangdut!

00:36:53.541 --> 00:36:55.875
- Hey!
- Glass...

00:36:55.962 --> 00:36:58.962
What music do you think
they put on in jail? Jazz music?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.625
- La?
- Yes, Naya?

00:37:12.976 --> 00:37:16.017
Send me the video of
Dad's witness testimony.

00:37:16.064 --> 00:37:17.273
For what?

00:37:17.541 --> 00:37:19.250
I'm looking for a legal counsel.

00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:21.416
If they're going to attack me,
I'm going to strike back.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.291
What?

00:37:26.875 --> 00:37:28.791
We're here to cure Dad.

00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:30.291
Not to strike back.

00:37:30.375 --> 00:37:32.166
But we can't only rely on Dad.

00:37:32.291 --> 00:37:33.167
Why not?

00:37:34.041 --> 00:37:35.875
Because he's not reliable.

00:37:37.578 --> 00:37:39.167
- Hurry up and send it to me.
- What?

00:37:39.416 --> 00:37:40.333
So long.

00:37:41.666 --> 00:37:43.166
Eat that!

00:37:45.416 --> 00:37:47.166
- Lola, where are you going?
- To take a shower.

00:37:48.298 --> 00:37:49.882
Nay, where are you going?

00:37:54.625 --> 00:38:01.291
The murder case involving a talented
24-year old young star, Naya Wardhani...

00:38:01.416 --> 00:38:02.666
...is still ongoing.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.791
There's still no official statement
from Naya or her attorney.

00:38:06.916 --> 00:38:11.125
But Naya's manager, Thomas,
has promised a reward...

00:38:11.166 --> 00:38:12.916
What are you watching?

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.625
I want to buy 200 sticks of satay.

00:38:34.666 --> 00:38:36.541
- Geez!
- Damn it!

00:38:38.666 --> 00:38:40.625
Why are you startling me?

00:38:40.666 --> 00:38:45.391
I'm not the killer. I swear, it's not me.
I'm being slandered.

00:38:45.416 --> 00:38:47.000
I swear to God, I don't kill anyone.

00:38:47.041 --> 00:38:48.916
Why don't you report
it to the police, then?

00:38:49.041 --> 00:38:51.459
I am going to the
police, but I'm looking for...

00:38:51.483 --> 00:38:54.108
...someone who understand
legal matters to accompany me.

00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:55.970
I understand legal matters.

00:38:56.353 --> 00:38:57.958
I have a lot of friends at the DMV...

00:38:58.125 --> 00:38:59.417
...that usually handle
of driver licenses.

00:39:01.791 --> 00:39:03.125
Someone else but you?

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.041
What's wrong with me?

00:39:05.125 --> 00:39:07.916
I need someone who went to law school.

00:39:08.041 --> 00:39:09.667
Law school?

00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:12.666
Just because I'm only
a high school graduate?

00:39:13.666 --> 00:39:16.416
Please understand, my
parents were just farmers.

00:39:18.166 --> 00:39:20.292
They couldn't put me in university.

00:39:20.541 --> 00:39:24.291
Oh, dear. That's not what I meant.

00:39:24.416 --> 00:39:26.916
Miss, I am only a peasant.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
But I help people sincerely
and wholeheartedly.

00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:37.291
Although the person kills her own manager
and now lives in my rental house...

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.641
- ...peacefully and comfortably.
- Okay, okay.

00:39:39.666 --> 00:39:41.666
Okay!

00:39:41.791 --> 00:39:44.041
Okay, I'm asking for your help!

00:39:46.291 --> 00:39:48.166
Okay, then. No problem.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.625
I'll ask my friends who
understand legal matters.

00:39:50.751 --> 00:39:51.695
You know someone!

00:39:51.844 --> 00:39:53.016
You should've told me before.

00:39:53.041 --> 00:39:54.666
Say it, then!

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.791
Careful, don't trip.

00:39:59.916 --> 00:40:01.000
Whoa!

00:40:01.041 --> 00:40:03.625
Hey, Tata. When will
Ria Buana perform again?

00:40:03.666 --> 00:40:06.375
Ria Buana doesn't do
a lot of gigs currently.

00:40:06.416 --> 00:40:09.416
You should marry someone
again so we get a job.

00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:12.250
- Just pray for me.
- Okay. Amen.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:15.041
We'll do this later. Let's just go there.

00:40:16.875 --> 00:40:18.916
I don't have money. Later, okay?

00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:20.041
Hey.

00:40:20.125 --> 00:40:21.666
Ta, when will you perform again?

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.250
Ria Buana doesn't do
a lot of gigs currently.

00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:26.416
When we get a gig again,
we'll buy something from you, okay?

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.750
Thank you.

00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:32.041
- Mom, I want that.
- What?

00:40:32.125 --> 00:40:33.916
- Did your teacher ask you to buy it?
- No.

00:40:34.041 --> 00:40:35.916
You think it's easy for me to get money?

00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:38.125
Just play with what you have at home.

00:40:38.916 --> 00:40:41.416
- Ladies, and gentlemen.
- Shh. What are they announcing just now?

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.666
Everyone, don't forget
to come to Larung Pes.

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:47.916
Larung Pes! It's the
announcement for Larung Pes.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.291
Sir, I want to have one! For my son!

00:40:52.625 --> 00:40:55.916
Thank you! Yay! Rio!

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.500
They have Rizal Maduma, Mom.

00:40:57.541 --> 00:41:00.416
I want to watch the performance
from the stage, like last year.

00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:03.541
Relax, I'm going to sing there too.

00:41:03.666 --> 00:41:06.666
When I sing, you watch
me from the stage, okay?

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.416
- Fun! Larung Pes!
- Hurray!

00:41:10.875 --> 00:41:13.000
- Do you see this woman?
- No.

00:41:13.041 --> 00:41:15.041
- No? Are you sure?
- Yes.

00:41:26.166 --> 00:41:30.166
I think they're in Singalaya area.

00:41:30.291 --> 00:41:34.916
I asked some vendors and shop owners there.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.625
This is the photo of the shop's owner.

00:41:43.166 --> 00:41:44.541
Crazy!

00:41:44.666 --> 00:41:46.000
Action!

00:41:49.791 --> 00:41:52.291
What do we have the shop owner's photo for?

00:41:52.416 --> 00:41:53.833
Where's Naya's photo?

00:41:54.416 --> 00:41:55.317
That's the thing.

00:41:56.041 --> 00:41:56.942
Go on.

00:41:57.291 --> 00:41:59.791
Our source is Bobon.

00:42:04.291 --> 00:42:05.916
Yes.

00:42:05.941 --> 00:42:07.857
Excellent!

00:42:09.375 --> 00:42:13.416
Now, sensual pose. Great.

00:42:13.541 --> 00:42:15.166
I like it.

00:42:17.791 --> 00:42:19.875
Just accept it. The photo
has been taken anyway.

00:42:32.541 --> 00:42:34.375
Help!

00:42:34.416 --> 00:42:35.750
Help!

00:42:37.666 --> 00:42:39.125
Help!

00:42:42.791 --> 00:42:44.041
What did you do to Zul?

00:42:45.541 --> 00:42:49.666
- Zul's dead!
- I did nothing, Thomas! I don't know!

00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:51.291
You must've done something.

00:42:51.416 --> 00:42:53.041
Who else was here, Lola?

00:42:53.125 --> 00:42:55.500
- She said it wasn't her doing!
- Zul is dead!

00:42:55.541 --> 00:42:57.416
How can she not
remember that Zul died here?

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.625
It's not my doing, Thomas.

00:43:25.791 --> 00:43:29.333
That's the way you should be.
Showered, fragrant, and beautiful.

00:43:30.041 --> 00:43:33.792
I talked to my attorney friend.

00:43:34.291 --> 00:43:35.916
In Jonggol.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:40.958
Is it true that he has Alzheimer?

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.791
He can be considered not credible
because his memory is impaired.

00:43:47.916 --> 00:43:50.401
But in the video, look,

00:43:50.651 --> 00:43:51.798
He can talk.

00:43:51.882 --> 00:43:55.548
But he has to talk to the investigator.

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.625
Everything will be checked.

00:43:58.666 --> 00:44:03.666
His medical, psychological,
and social conditions.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.875
It's complicated, Yatno.

00:44:06.831 --> 00:44:08.500
You have a point.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:21.542
Where are you going?

00:44:22.375 --> 00:44:23.750
So, what do we do?

00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:27.625
You're not going to eat meatballs?

00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:28.208
Sir!

00:44:28.344 --> 00:44:33.391
La, I have to go. You and Dad
stay here until the rent is due.

00:44:33.416 --> 00:44:35.942
I will send you money through Yatno, okay?

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:37.667
Where are you going?

00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:40.541
We were going to cure Dad together here.

00:44:40.625 --> 00:44:43.469
But he isn't credible due to his illness.

00:44:43.494 --> 00:44:47.417
Not credible? How could you say that?

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.875
I don't have any other proof.

00:44:49.916 --> 00:44:52.475
He's our dad. He's credible.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.828
But I have to run away.
It'll be hard to do it with Dad.

00:44:54.853 --> 00:44:56.833
You keep running away. You never stop.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.875
- What's going on here?
- I don't know!

00:45:04.916 --> 00:45:06.791
- Naya, what happened?
- I don't know!

00:45:06.875 --> 00:45:09.791
Why is Dad here?

00:45:09.875 --> 00:45:11.541
Dad was dumped by his wife.

00:45:34.369 --> 00:45:37.244
What time is it now?
You're like a ghost, coming at this time.

00:46:06.416 --> 00:46:08.916
Just go with it, don't fight it.

00:47:49.875 --> 00:47:51.791
Great!

00:47:51.875 --> 00:47:54.541
What a great flute play. And it's so long!

00:48:01.791 --> 00:48:03.541
Nay, drink this.

00:48:09.416 --> 00:48:11.417
Wan, I want to talk to you.

00:48:11.625 --> 00:48:12.916
Aren't you in prison yet?

00:48:13.041 --> 00:48:14.583
Don't you want to talk to me?

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:16.666
Do you still want me to sing for your band?

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:17.875
Orchestra.

00:48:17.916 --> 00:48:19.083
Do you really want to?

00:48:19.416 --> 00:48:21.917
But I have one condition.

00:48:27.541 --> 00:48:28.542
Naya.

00:48:30.463 --> 00:48:31.692
Not asleep yet?

00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:33.583
Aren't you running away?

00:48:33.736 --> 00:48:35.042
I'm waiting for you to sleep first.

00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:36.833
Seriously?

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:38.708
Of course not.

00:48:39.524 --> 00:48:40.667
You're right, La.

00:48:41.375 --> 00:48:42.958
I don't want to run anymore.

00:48:43.916 --> 00:48:47.125
Go to sleep now!
Don't forget! Tomorrow is show time!

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:51.375
You're joining their band?

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.416
Orchestra.

00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:54.375
Why?

00:48:54.916 --> 00:48:57.375
I have a plan.

00:48:57.666 --> 00:48:59.000
What plan?

00:49:00.993 --> 00:49:02.243
Enough.

00:49:02.924 --> 00:49:04.667
Just trust me.

00:49:05.125 --> 00:49:09.041
The important thing is you focus on
taking care of Dad. Okay?

00:49:10.291 --> 00:49:12.291
I'm going to the basement for a while.

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:13.042
Bye.

00:49:14.875 --> 00:49:18.541
Okay, Princess.
The jacuzzi has been prepared for you.

00:49:27.666 --> 00:49:31.416
La, wake up. I have to go.

00:49:35.125 --> 00:49:38.625
What if someone recognize me when I sing?

00:49:38.798 --> 00:49:41.132
No problem. It's only a
matter of your appearance.

00:49:56.166 --> 00:49:59.250
Nay, dance. Let it all go.

00:49:59.291 --> 00:50:00.791
Just go with the flow.

00:50:00.827 --> 00:50:02.493
Move forward. Do it.

00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:29.250
Wilted before she even blooms.

00:51:42.875 --> 00:51:45.125
This is the money from our gig.

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:46.791
This is your share.

00:51:48.204 --> 00:51:48.943
What?

00:51:48.968 --> 00:51:50.975
I was singing hard but
I only get 34 thousand?

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.250
How much do you and Wawan get?

00:51:52.541 --> 00:51:55.000
Each of us gets 100 thousand.

00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:56.625
- Wait.
- "Wait"?

00:51:56.666 --> 00:51:58.375
You should be thankful, Naya.

00:51:58.416 --> 00:52:00.340
A lot of dangdut singers
out there who aren't...

00:52:00.364 --> 00:52:02.000
...as lucky as you and
don't get 34 thousand.

00:52:02.041 --> 00:52:03.958
They probably only get 32 thousand.

00:52:04.291 --> 00:52:07.725
Only a 2 thousand difference.
Don't steal people's money.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.500
You live in the big city for too long,
you're spoiled.

00:52:10.603 --> 00:52:12.895
Everyone has to do what you want.

00:52:13.166 --> 00:52:15.625
This is how we do it in Singalaya.

00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:18.552
Rules from where? from Hong Kong?
Whatever.

00:52:18.577 --> 00:52:19.410
Hey, Naya.

00:52:20.416 --> 00:52:22.025
Bring this with you.

00:52:22.666 --> 00:52:25.000
Your sister wants to borrow my guitar.
Give it to her.

00:52:25.166 --> 00:52:26.541
Why does she want this?

00:52:28.416 --> 00:52:30.416
Lols!

00:52:30.541 --> 00:52:31.067
Yes?

00:52:31.422 --> 00:52:33.891
Here, there's something for you.

00:52:33.916 --> 00:52:35.416
- From Wendhoy.
- It's here.

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.791
What is this for?

00:52:38.654 --> 00:52:39.491
I was...

00:52:39.516 --> 00:52:40.583
Look.

00:52:41.666 --> 00:52:45.291
I read a journal about Alzheimer.

00:52:46.625 --> 00:52:52.541
It is said that aside from visual,
audio can also stimulate the memory.

00:52:55.291 --> 00:52:56.083
Dad.

00:52:57.041 --> 00:52:58.875
Do you remember Mom's favorite song?

00:53:35.541 --> 00:53:37.000
I have to go.

00:53:37.041 --> 00:53:38.292
Dad!

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:40.917
Dad!

00:53:42.875 --> 00:53:44.833
I have to go home.

00:53:45.291 --> 00:53:46.108
Now.

00:53:48.666 --> 00:53:50.750
- Dad.
- La. Oh, dear.

00:53:50.807 --> 00:53:51.568
Dad.

00:53:51.816 --> 00:53:52.583
Dad!

00:53:53.125 --> 00:53:53.917
Dad!

00:53:54.166 --> 00:53:56.240
- Sir.
- Move.

00:53:56.265 --> 00:53:57.042
Naya.

00:53:57.609 --> 00:53:59.525
- I want to go there.
- Sorry!

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:00.833
Dad!

00:54:00.915 --> 00:54:03.374
- Dad, no!
- Dad!

00:54:03.666 --> 00:54:05.291
Dad!

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:06.375
Open!

00:54:06.416 --> 00:54:08.041
Help us!

00:54:08.125 --> 00:54:09.601
What's wrong with your dad?

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:11.150
What's wrong with you?

00:54:11.375 --> 00:54:13.541
- Move!
- Don't move!

00:54:13.625 --> 00:54:16.875
Sir!

00:54:16.916 --> 00:54:18.666
Dad! What should we do?

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:20.541
Your dad is troubling us!

00:54:20.625 --> 00:54:22.416
Sir!

00:54:22.541 --> 00:54:24.875
- Diana!
- Help!

00:54:24.916 --> 00:54:28.875
Who is Diana? God! Diana! Help me, Diana!

00:54:28.916 --> 00:54:31.666
- Diana!
- Sir! Help!

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.375
Diana!

00:54:34.416 --> 00:54:37.291
God! What sin did I do, God?

00:54:37.416 --> 00:54:40.166
There's no God but Allah. Stop!

00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:53.666
Stop, sir! Stop!

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:56.291
Diana!

00:54:57.675 --> 00:54:58.777
Hurry, hurry!

00:55:00.791 --> 00:55:02.166
Dad!

00:55:02.291 --> 00:55:03.416
- Hurry!
- Wan.

00:55:03.441 --> 00:55:05.125
Dad?

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:06.958
- You check on Wawan, okay?
- Okay.

00:55:07.416 --> 00:55:09.250
- Dad?
- Dad?

00:55:09.291 --> 00:55:10.666
Oh, God!

00:55:10.705 --> 00:55:11.830
Wawan!

00:55:11.923 --> 00:55:13.048
Wan!

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:14.750
Wawan!

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:18.219
Wan!

00:55:18.244 --> 00:55:20.442
Are you still alive?

00:55:20.916 --> 00:55:24.750
I don't want to die
just yet if I'm still poor.

00:55:33.315 --> 00:55:35.458
Please, Sir.
How much?

00:55:36.095 --> 00:55:37.221
It's crowded here.

00:55:37.246 --> 00:55:39.125
This is nothing.

00:55:39.417 --> 00:55:41.166
Larung Pes will be more crowded.

00:55:41.276 --> 00:55:42.104
Wawan!

00:55:42.265 --> 00:55:43.265
Wawan!

00:55:45.166 --> 00:55:47.416
Guess who will come here.

00:55:47.541 --> 00:55:49.542
- Who?
- Rizal Maduma!

00:55:50.791 --> 00:55:52.166
- Seriously?
- Yes.

00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:54.625
- Who is that?
- This is our chance. We have to do our best!

00:55:54.666 --> 00:55:57.416
- Yes! Let's get ready.
- Come on!

00:55:57.541 --> 00:55:59.875
Naya, Dad and I will wait here.

00:56:00.009 --> 00:56:00.885
You can do it!

00:56:01.541 --> 00:56:02.233
Let's go, Dad.

00:56:02.671 --> 00:56:03.816
Is there anything you want to buy?

00:56:04.628 --> 00:56:06.375
It's definitely more crowded at night.

00:56:06.587 --> 00:56:08.275
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.

00:56:08.541 --> 00:56:11.791
Nay, we will perform
in an hour. After dusk.

00:56:11.875 --> 00:56:13.625
Okay, in an hour, after dusk.

00:56:23.541 --> 00:56:25.291
You're going to perform here too, Wan?

00:56:25.416 --> 00:56:28.458
Why? Can't we compete fairly? Sit down.

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:32.291
Compete fairly? What are you talking about?
I was the one who bought your keyboard.

00:56:32.416 --> 00:56:34.041
I am trying here.

00:56:34.066 --> 00:56:36.358
What are you trying? Trying with her?

00:56:36.666 --> 00:56:37.792
Something wrong with that?

00:56:38.666 --> 00:56:39.917
Nothing.

00:56:40.666 --> 00:56:43.417
But you look like a guy.

00:56:44.041 --> 00:56:47.250
Seriously, Wan.
Why are you with someone like this?

00:56:47.666 --> 00:56:50.458
Hey! She's a rising singer!

00:56:50.666 --> 00:56:52.875
Unlike you, whose time is up!

00:56:53.016 --> 00:56:54.641
Hey, don’t talk nonsense!

00:56:54.666 --> 00:56:56.125
Stop it. Why do you have to say that?

00:56:56.166 --> 00:56:58.333
You know my situation.
Don't make a ruckus here.

00:56:59.041 --> 00:57:02.750
I bet you found this singer
from a prostitution app.

00:57:02.791 --> 00:57:05.416
- Rude. What do you mean by that?
- What?

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:08.000
- Do you even know me?
- I surely don't.

00:57:08.041 --> 00:57:11.291
Stop fighting! Stop!

00:57:11.375 --> 00:57:13.125
You stop talking.

00:57:13.166 --> 00:57:14.791
I've been patient.

00:57:14.916 --> 00:57:17.891
Hey! Stop! Stop arguing. It's embarrassing.

00:57:17.916 --> 00:57:21.666
Let's just leave. You're
all stinky. Let's go.

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:22.916
You're a guy!

00:57:23.041 --> 00:57:24.917
You trashy peasant!

00:57:25.615 --> 00:57:28.016
Calm down. Don't take everything to heart.

00:57:28.041 --> 00:57:29.917
Or else you'll have liver problem
and your body will be yellow.

00:57:30.916 --> 00:57:33.416
Stop laughing. I'm pissed.

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.917
You do look like a guy.

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:39.916
- Like a guy...
- See? You hit like a private.

00:57:40.041 --> 00:57:42.375
- Do you know what a private is?
- No.

00:57:42.416 --> 00:57:43.858
When in war, they'd be on the front.

00:57:44.791 --> 00:57:47.250
Just see, I'll be pretty.

00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:49.875
I don't care whether you'll be
pretty or you'll wear an army uniform.

00:57:49.916 --> 00:57:51.125
The important thing is I will perform.

00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.333
What are you talking about?

00:57:52.495 --> 00:57:53.916
I am fuming.

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:56.375
We can have a boxing match on the stage.
Do you want that?

00:57:57.541 --> 00:57:58.458
Stop it!

00:58:00.416 --> 00:58:02.416
I want to order the 12 thousand one.

00:58:05.972 --> 00:58:06.584
Yes.

00:58:07.125 --> 00:58:08.416
The burnt one.

00:58:30.541 --> 00:58:31.775
Dad?

00:58:32.056 --> 00:58:34.556
Dad! Where are you going? Dad.

00:58:34.791 --> 00:58:37.583
Where are you going?
We haven't eaten yet. Sit down.

00:58:38.041 --> 00:58:39.125
Who is it?

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.250
Who is it?

00:58:51.125 --> 00:58:52.400
Who is it? What's going on?

00:58:54.125 --> 00:58:54.958
Dad?

00:59:07.416 --> 00:59:09.391
- I don't look like a guy anymore, right?
- No.

00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:13.749
Good evening, everyone.

00:59:23.041 --> 00:59:25.125
Left, left.

00:59:25.166 --> 00:59:27.291
Right, right.

00:59:27.375 --> 00:59:28.625
Left...

00:59:37.783 --> 00:59:40.333
Get off the stage!

00:59:41.612 --> 00:59:42.769
Hey.

00:59:42.916 --> 00:59:43.471
Hey!

00:59:43.496 --> 00:59:45.392
- Hey, calm down!
- What's wrong with you?

00:59:45.666 --> 00:59:47.833
- Dad!
- Ouch.

00:59:48.916 --> 00:59:50.166
Naya!

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:52.674
Help Dad!

00:59:52.699 --> 00:59:53.254
Hey!

00:59:53.916 --> 00:59:55.916
Dad, get on stage.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.291
What?

00:59:57.375 --> 00:59:59.041
What?

00:59:59.125 --> 01:00:01.500
Stop!

01:00:01.541 --> 01:00:02.833
Miss.

01:00:03.041 --> 01:00:06.666
The generator is off.
But the mic is still on, its source is different.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.333
Okay.

01:00:09.541 --> 01:00:11.000
Hey.

01:00:11.032 --> 01:00:12.056
Acoustic.

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:14.506
- Acoustic? Seriously.
- Acoustic. Come on.

01:00:14.791 --> 01:00:16.375
Stop it.

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:34.291
My sister!

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:12.166
- My daughter!
- Encore, encore, encore!

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:35.833
Okay, then. Dad and I will go home now, okay?

01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:37.417
- Okay.
- Bye.

01:02:38.291 --> 01:02:39.750
Go home soon, Sis.

01:02:47.943 --> 01:02:49.359
- Hey, La.
- Yes?

01:02:49.541 --> 01:02:53.542
I'm going home with you.

01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:55.166
What about Wawan and Wendhoy?

01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:58.541
I'm gonna come to them first.
They're eating back there.

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:00.388
- Okay, then.
- But you wait here, okay?

01:03:00.413 --> 01:03:02.250
- I'll be back.
- Don't take too long.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.666
What is that?

01:03:03.756 --> 01:03:04.278
Huh?

01:03:04.303 --> 01:03:08.251
Rizal!

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:09.666
What is that?

01:03:09.791 --> 01:03:14.416
Rizal!

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:15.541
Okay.

01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:17.125
Put me down here.

01:03:24.125 --> 01:03:24.958
You...

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:29.792
I saw your charisma on stage, it's truly...

01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:32.125
...remarkable.

01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:36.906
Sorry, but who are you?

01:03:36.931 --> 01:03:38.750
I'm Rizal.

01:03:40.125 --> 01:03:42.266
I'm a legendary dangdut producer.

01:03:42.291 --> 01:03:44.916
Rizal!

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.958
LEGENDARY DANGDUT PRODUCER.

01:03:47.666 --> 01:03:49.666
Nice to meet you, I'm Nay...

01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:51.166
Aduduh (Ouch).

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:52.167
"Aduduh"?

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:57.291
Yayahh Aduduh. Because she often says that.

01:03:57.416 --> 01:03:58.792
Yes.

01:03:59.375 --> 01:04:01.291
BECAUSE SHE OFTEN SAYS THAT.

01:04:01.416 --> 01:04:03.375
Fantastic.

01:04:04.791 --> 01:04:06.791
I want you to perform at Larung Pes.

01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:08.625
Larung Pes?

01:04:08.916 --> 01:04:09.875
Larung Pes.

01:04:10.416 --> 01:04:13.166
- Larung Pes.
- Larung Pes?

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.791
Excuse me, Mr. Rizal.

01:04:14.816 --> 01:04:17.900
The schedule for Larung Pes performers
is fully booked.

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:25.875
No problem. Call the committee.
Tell them to cancel one performer.

01:04:25.916 --> 01:04:28.250
Replace them with Yayahh Aduduh.
Can you do that?

01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:30.500
- Yes, Sir.
- If you can't, just jump into the sea.

01:04:33.916 --> 01:04:35.375
See you at Larung Pes...

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.125
...Yayahh Aduduh.

01:04:37.166 --> 01:04:37.875
Yes, Sir.

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:40.125
People!

01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:41.375
- Yes.
- Yes, Boss!

01:04:42.314 --> 01:04:43.648
Let's go.

01:04:43.791 --> 01:04:49.416
Rizal!

01:04:49.509 --> 01:04:50.884
Wait.

01:04:51.041 --> 01:04:52.625
Why is he going back there?

01:04:52.666 --> 01:04:53.875
I don't know.

01:04:53.916 --> 01:04:55.500
So weird.

01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:59.250
A weird guy.

01:04:59.509 --> 01:05:00.907
Rizal Maduma?

01:05:01.149 --> 01:05:02.868
Why didn't you call me, Nay?

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.416
Should I have done that?

01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:06.291
This is my orchestra.

01:05:07.916 --> 01:05:09.608
Larung Pes is my dream.

01:05:09.916 --> 01:05:14.500
Well, what should I have done?
It's me, Yayahh Aduduh, who Rizal likes.

01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:15.625
What kind of name is that?

01:05:15.666 --> 01:05:17.791
Does this group even have a name?

01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:19.416
What if we name it Wawan and Friends?

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.750
Shut up. We're being serious here.

01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:23.149
Enough of this.

01:05:23.312 --> 01:05:25.187
You should be thankful.

01:05:25.423 --> 01:05:29.708
We got invited by Rizal because of me.
Because of Yayahh Aduduh.

01:05:30.008 --> 01:05:30.650
Enough.

01:05:31.166 --> 01:05:33.054
You traitor!

01:05:33.079 --> 01:05:34.740
Hey, Wan.

01:05:35.947 --> 01:05:37.445
What about Wawan and Partner?

01:05:38.131 --> 01:05:39.172
Keep talking.

01:05:39.291 --> 01:05:40.667
Wawan and Bestie.

01:05:40.916 --> 01:05:42.416
I'll slash you.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.750
I'd topple, then.

01:05:44.291 --> 01:05:46.167
Why can't you stop talking?

01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:48.733
Eat some noodles, then. Come on.

01:05:52.039 --> 01:05:54.789
It's either talking to Dajjal or Satan.

01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:58.416
I'm hurt by that traitor.

01:05:59.791 --> 01:06:02.666
But you're in it.
You also have to understand.

01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:05.666
What's going on?

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:08.541
Ria Buana can't perform at Larung Pes.

01:06:08.666 --> 01:06:12.166
Ask him. You tyrant!
The descendant of Firaun.

01:06:12.291 --> 01:06:14.167
How could you?

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:17.875
I told my son I would perform at Larung.

01:06:18.416 --> 01:06:20.041
He's counting on that.

01:06:20.166 --> 01:06:22.791
Ta, it wasn't me.

01:06:22.875 --> 01:06:25.583
There are a lot of performers already.

01:06:25.875 --> 01:06:30.916
And Rizal wants a new singer.
A fresher one.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.667
So he chose one.

01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:34.292
Yayahh Aduduh.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.041
Mr. Thomas?

01:06:46.666 --> 01:06:47.583
That's me.

01:06:49.416 --> 01:06:51.416
I have an info on Naya.

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:52.791
Who is this?

01:06:52.916 --> 01:06:54.792
Will you still reward me 10 million?

01:06:55.416 --> 01:06:58.042
I will, as long as you're being truthful.

01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:59.916
Just trust me.

01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:01.416
I will keep in touch.

01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:02.208
Okay?

01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:08.416
Oh, God! Don't startle me.

01:07:08.541 --> 01:07:09.573
You're like an owl.

01:07:09.598 --> 01:07:11.500
You're only standing there and don't
make a sound in the middle of the night.

01:07:11.791 --> 01:07:13.417
So, that's the way you do this?

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:14.875
What do I do?

01:07:14.916 --> 01:07:17.192
Your singer overtakes
Ria Buana in Larung Pes.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.666
That's not what we're trying to do.

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:23.000
Just blame Rizal Maduma. Don't blame me.

01:07:28.835 --> 01:07:30.250
Where is this old guy going?

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:44.875
You may think I don't care about you, Wan.

01:07:46.791 --> 01:07:51.958
But when your mom died,
you were my most beloved kid.

01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:03.166
Don't say things like that.

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:04.541
Don't touch me!

01:08:04.625 --> 01:08:05.750
What's wrong?

01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:06.875
I'm disgusted!

01:08:07.916 --> 01:08:09.275
I have only one wish.

01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:11.208
What?

01:08:11.233 --> 01:08:12.873
You have to be great.

01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:16.310
Don't embarrass me and your mom.

01:08:25.541 --> 01:08:26.875
I promise you!

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:29.167
I'll make you proud!

01:08:33.791 --> 01:08:34.917
Too late, idiot!

01:08:35.541 --> 01:08:37.166
I've been proud of you!

01:08:37.291 --> 01:08:38.917
Since you were born.

01:08:39.541 --> 01:08:41.041
Even though you never shower.

01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:44.417
Don't you ever realize
that your armpits stink like a burnt cable?

01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:20.041
Dad?

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.762
Where are you going,
dressed up that nicely?

01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:24.708
Your mom has been waiting too long.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.875
We have to go home today.

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:27.833
- Dad.
- Let's go.

01:09:28.291 --> 01:09:30.166
- Let's go. I'm serious.
- Dad...

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.750
You're right. We've been here too long.

01:09:32.929 --> 01:09:35.720
Okay, then. Tidy your
clothes. They're so messy.

01:09:35.875 --> 01:09:38.916
Or else it'll take us longer to go home.
I'll find Naya.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.291
- Naya!
- Don't take too long!

01:09:41.375 --> 01:09:42.667
Okay, Dad!

01:09:42.953 --> 01:09:44.994
Naya is here!

01:09:45.541 --> 01:09:46.791
Okay!

01:09:48.666 --> 01:09:49.500
Naya!

01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:55.166
Naya.

01:09:56.666 --> 01:09:57.417
Naya.

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:03.541
Inside there.

01:10:03.684 --> 01:10:04.833
Follow my instruction.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.708
Grab the person when I say so.

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:07.958
Don't hesitate.

01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:09.583
Move.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:12.942
You all coming along, right?

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.250
Let's get the person.

01:10:15.423 --> 01:10:16.632
Okay?

01:10:21.916 --> 01:10:23.416
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.775
Do you think I'm an idiot and know nothing?

01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:29.291
You killed Zul, didn't
you? Just admit it, Thomas.

01:10:29.375 --> 01:10:31.750
- Say something. Admit it!
- Naya!

01:10:31.789 --> 01:10:34.373
Run! The police is here! Police!

01:10:34.416 --> 01:10:35.458
Freeze!

01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:39.357
Sir, forgive her. My sister
did nothing wrong. I swear.

01:10:39.541 --> 01:10:42.291
- Thomas lied. Forgive her.
- Lola!

01:10:42.375 --> 01:10:43.916
Stop.

01:10:45.416 --> 01:10:48.041
I told you I had a plan.

01:10:48.166 --> 01:10:50.125
This is the plan.

01:10:52.359 --> 01:10:55.900
You shouldn't interfere
if you don't know anything.

01:10:56.006 --> 01:10:57.756
They're only politrons.

01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:01.791
Soap Opera Police.

01:11:01.947 --> 01:11:05.447
They usually act as the
police in soap operas.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.250
What is this?

01:11:07.291 --> 01:11:08.875
Come here, let me tell you.

01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:12.916
We're making a fake scenario here.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.541
They're going to arrest Thomas.

01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:18.916
And then we're going to force
Thomas to admit his actions.

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:20.666
What are you saying?

01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:25.666
That's the plan. That's what
we've been planning all along, Lola.

01:11:25.791 --> 01:11:27.291
I have one condition.

01:11:27.375 --> 01:11:30.750
She joins my dangdut group
and I help her frame Thomas.

01:11:30.791 --> 01:11:31.542
Who is this?

01:11:31.642 --> 01:11:33.250
Will you still reward me?

01:11:33.416 --> 01:11:35.416
I called him to come.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.166
Are you sure Thomas is the killer?

01:11:37.291 --> 01:11:41.166
I am. I have Dad's eyewitness testimony.

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:43.750
They will act as if they got the recording.

01:11:43.791 --> 01:11:47.750
But the recording isn't complete yet.
Dad doesn't know who did it.

01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:49.250
Does Thomas know that?

01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:53.291
- When will you do this?
- Tomorrow.

01:11:53.416 --> 01:11:55.916
- Tomorrow?
- Before Larung Pes.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.541
What if you fail?

01:11:57.634 --> 01:11:59.100
Wan, what if you fail?

01:11:59.125 --> 01:12:01.292
Relax, I'll help with my prayers.

01:12:02.166 --> 01:12:04.916
What are you doing?
Why is this komodo in here?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.475
I want to turn on the light, it's dark.

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:07.625
Get in!

01:12:09.166 --> 01:12:10.916
Naya.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.958
- Dad! I locked Dad in the room!
- What?

01:12:12.983 --> 01:12:14.141
I forgot!

01:12:14.166 --> 01:12:16.791
You talk to Dad. I don't know what else...

01:12:18.291 --> 01:12:21.417
- La?
- Dad?

01:12:21.666 --> 01:12:23.541
He broke through this door.

01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:26.916
- Dad!
- Dad?

01:12:27.916 --> 01:12:29.167
Gosh!

01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:31.291
Sir.

01:12:31.416 --> 01:12:32.458
Sir, did you see my dad?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.166
He just asked me where the terminal is.

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:36.250
But it's far.

01:12:36.875 --> 01:12:38.000
Idiot.

01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:41.500
It's nearer if you cut through the pier.
I drew him the map.

01:12:41.541 --> 01:12:42.791
- He went over there.
- Sir!

01:12:42.916 --> 01:12:44.625
Why did you help him?

01:12:44.666 --> 01:12:47.042
- He's an elder. I need to help him.
- Find him!

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:48.208
Dad!

01:12:49.416 --> 01:12:50.317
Dad!

01:12:51.041 --> 01:12:51.875
Dad!

01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:53.250
Dad!

01:12:54.291 --> 01:12:55.317
Dad!

01:12:56.291 --> 01:12:57.791
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.666
Dad!

01:13:00.726 --> 01:13:04.143
Girls, where are you going?
Just like a crazy-girls in afternoon.

01:13:04.214 --> 01:13:06.266
Where are you going in a hurry?

01:13:06.495 --> 01:13:07.333
We're looking for Dad.

01:13:07.628 --> 01:13:08.769
I see...

01:13:08.794 --> 01:13:13.335
I understand, girls your age
need a fatherly figure.

01:13:13.541 --> 01:13:15.166
I know a widower. Want to meet him?

01:13:15.218 --> 01:13:17.259
I'm not in the mood for
jokes. Just answer this.

01:13:17.316 --> 01:13:21.400
If I want to go to the terminal
through the pier shortcut, is it far?

01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:23.875
It is far, if you go
through this small alley.

01:13:23.916 --> 01:13:26.916
If you want to be fast,
go through the big street. By car.

01:13:27.041 --> 01:13:28.041
Oh, no!

01:13:29.541 --> 01:13:31.518
We have to go back and get the car, then.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:32.761
Hey...

01:13:33.116 --> 01:13:34.300
I have a car, you know.

01:13:34.791 --> 01:13:35.916
Don't underestimate me.

01:13:35.962 --> 01:13:38.962
Although I'm a commoner, I have a car.

01:13:41.916 --> 01:13:43.791
Walking would be faster.

01:13:45.041 --> 01:13:47.000
And less embarrassing.

01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:55.000
What do you say?
It's nice to ride my car, isn't it?

01:13:55.041 --> 01:13:57.625
Can you go a little faster? Just a little.

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:00.000
I can't, the road is bad.

01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:03.500
You don't want us to fall
out and hurt ourselves.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.291
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:14:08.416 --> 01:14:11.291
Sir, turn!

01:14:11.326 --> 01:14:13.653
- Slowly! Don't panic!
- Dad!

01:14:13.678 --> 01:14:15.026
- Don't scream by my ear!
- Dad!

01:14:15.166 --> 01:14:19.166
Calm down!

01:14:19.291 --> 01:14:22.166
Hang on!

01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:24.125
Dad!

01:14:24.235 --> 01:14:25.860
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:14:26.541 --> 01:14:27.791
Where have you been?

01:14:27.916 --> 01:14:30.000
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:36.042
Diana?

01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:38.708
Diana.

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:48.162
Diana.

01:15:05.416 --> 01:15:07.291
Diana.

01:15:15.291 --> 01:15:16.442
Dad.

01:15:17.166 --> 01:15:18.666
I'm not Mom.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.167
I'm Naya.

01:15:21.625 --> 01:15:22.791
Dad.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.567
Your mom was here!

01:15:28.916 --> 01:15:32.916
- Gosh, where's Diana?
- Okay, then.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.625
- Dad.
- Dad.

01:15:34.666 --> 01:15:36.875
- Dad.
- Dad, let's go home.

01:15:36.916 --> 01:15:39.070
- Let's go home, with me and Naya. Okay?
- Yes.

01:15:39.095 --> 01:15:41.886
With me and Naya.

01:15:42.281 --> 01:15:43.812
I have to go home now!

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:44.609
Dad!

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:47.166
- Dad!
- I have to go home!

01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:48.414
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:15:49.791 --> 01:15:51.291
Sir.

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:52.666
Dad!

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:54.166
- Dad!
- Diana!

01:15:54.291 --> 01:15:56.083
- Dad, where are you going?
- Dad!

01:15:56.108 --> 01:15:58.292
- Dad, please don't!
- Diana!

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.250
Dad!

01:16:01.235 --> 01:16:04.541
- Diana!
- Dad!

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.250
Dad, let's go home.

01:16:07.291 --> 01:16:08.541
- Dad!
- No!

01:16:08.566 --> 01:16:10.732
- Let's go home with me and Naya.
- No.

01:16:10.916 --> 01:16:12.000
- Dad.
- Dad, listen...

01:16:13.875 --> 01:16:15.042
Dad!

01:16:15.291 --> 01:16:17.041
Dad, let's go home.

01:16:18.116 --> 01:16:19.907
Mom's dead!

01:16:20.103 --> 01:16:21.353
Naya!

01:16:24.375 --> 01:16:26.542
Mom died three years ago!

01:16:28.416 --> 01:16:30.625
I'm tired of telling you this.

01:16:37.416 --> 01:16:38.125
Here.

01:16:39.125 --> 01:16:40.416
Dad.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.000
- Dad.
- No...

01:16:44.875 --> 01:16:46.541
Diana.

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:51.750
We should've told him
from the start. I told you.

01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:53.750
I told you this from the start!

01:16:53.791 --> 01:16:55.416
Enough, Naya!

01:16:55.541 --> 01:16:57.375
I'm also tired, you know!

01:16:57.791 --> 01:16:58.916
Enough!

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.416
We've been like this for three years!

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:03.291
And now Dad comes
and be like this. Stop it!

01:17:03.416 --> 01:17:04.541
Naya, stop it!

01:17:04.666 --> 01:17:07.291
So, stop leaving.

01:17:07.416 --> 01:17:09.291
- Where else are you going to go?
- Stop this!

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:11.125
Where else are you going to look for Mom?

01:17:11.166 --> 01:17:13.125
- Stop this.
- Diana.

01:17:15.125 --> 01:17:17.375
Stop this.

01:17:17.416 --> 01:17:18.541
Stop what?

01:17:18.625 --> 01:17:20.541
I'm sick of this, you know.

01:17:23.041 --> 01:17:25.000
We should've told him from the start.

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:27.166
Dad should know.

01:17:32.666 --> 01:17:35.291
Dad should know.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.541
Mom died three years ago, Lola.

01:17:48.666 --> 01:17:50.791
He has to know.

01:18:15.971 --> 01:18:17.334
I'm exhausted.

01:18:21.416 --> 01:18:23.166
I'm exhausted, Lola.

01:18:42.791 --> 01:18:45.166
- We're doing this, Wan.
- We are!

01:18:46.291 --> 01:18:48.791
- I didn't expect this.
- You're only saying that.

01:18:48.875 --> 01:18:50.541
Get them up here.

01:18:51.916 --> 01:18:54.042
Get up here. Don't be lazy.

01:18:54.416 --> 01:18:55.916
Slowly.

01:18:57.041 --> 01:18:59.541
Yes? Hello. Thomas?

01:18:59.625 --> 01:19:01.250
So, all set up?

01:19:02.541 --> 01:19:05.291
I don't work out often.
Don't tell me to sit up.

01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:07.400
Set up, idiot!

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:13.000
I mean, have you set
up everything with Naya?

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:15.416
Oh, that. I have.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.792
You just wait.

01:19:17.166 --> 01:19:18.791
As per our initial deal, okay?

01:19:19.875 --> 01:19:21.167
Don't forget about the 10 million.

01:19:35.666 --> 01:19:37.042
One day...

01:19:37.916 --> 01:19:40.125
...your dad will come home.

01:19:42.291 --> 01:19:44.666
And he will apologize to us.

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.417
And will you forgive him?

01:19:47.791 --> 01:19:49.375
I have forgiven him.

01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:53.791
Whatever you say, Mom.

01:19:57.541 --> 01:20:00.625
You have to apologize to your dad one day.

01:20:01.666 --> 01:20:03.667
What did I do wrong?

01:20:06.041 --> 01:20:09.458
Your deep hatred toward him.

01:20:10.041 --> 01:20:12.791
Does Dad know that I hate him?

01:20:15.375 --> 01:20:17.291
God knows.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.250
Nay?

01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:28.541
Nay?

01:20:30.791 --> 01:20:33.417
The committee said we perform after dusk.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.163
That's in two hours.

01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:38.083
Thomas is waiting too.

01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:39.667
Naya.

01:20:41.625 --> 01:20:43.166
Dad's condition is getting worse.

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:09.229
It's been like this since last night.

01:21:09.916 --> 01:21:12.041
He doesn't want to eat.

01:21:13.041 --> 01:21:14.042
Dad.

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:15.708
Let's go to the doctor.

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.416
Who are you?

01:21:27.791 --> 01:21:30.375
He's been like this since he woke up.

01:21:32.431 --> 01:21:37.681
I don't want to be here.

01:21:39.666 --> 01:21:40.958
Nay.

01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:42.416
Let's go.

01:21:44.916 --> 01:21:46.000
Nay.

01:21:48.625 --> 01:21:49.192
La...

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:51.850
...you have to come.

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:54.166
As soon as I finish all this...

01:21:55.375 --> 01:21:56.916
...we're going to the doctor.

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:02.166
I'm leaving for now, Dad.

01:22:04.797 --> 01:22:05.833
I'm leaving.

01:22:07.541 --> 01:22:08.108
Naya.

01:22:12.666 --> 01:22:17.666
If this thing with Thomas fails...

01:22:19.041 --> 01:22:21.042
...you'll be okay, right?

01:22:37.166 --> 01:22:38.416
Let's go.

01:22:45.250 --> 01:22:46.208
Get ready.

01:22:49.416 --> 01:22:51.667
Larung Pes, Nay. Larung Pes!

01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:56.000
Wawan. Naya.

01:22:56.041 --> 01:22:57.791
Yatno, are the politrons ready?

01:22:57.916 --> 01:23:00.750
They're ready. But the guys the
other day were called for shooting.

01:23:00.791 --> 01:23:03.791
But all good, I've prepared
their replacements.

01:23:03.916 --> 01:23:05.833
As long as they understand what to do.

01:23:06.291 --> 01:23:07.083
Yes, Sir.

01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:10.667
Your pants are nice. Go get ready.

01:23:11.625 --> 01:23:15.916
How fierce these keyboard singers are.

01:23:16.041 --> 01:23:17.666
They must be Perbaungan's keyboard.

01:23:19.041 --> 01:23:20.541
Check mic.

01:23:29.119 --> 01:23:31.494
- It looks great.
- Of course, it's Larung Pes.

01:23:31.625 --> 01:23:34.041
- Are you happy?
- This is my dream, Nay.

01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:35.416
This is my dream.

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.500
- Miss Yayahh Aduduh?
- Yes.

01:23:37.541 --> 01:23:39.291
- Hello.
- Wawan.

01:23:39.375 --> 01:23:42.041
Wawan. Hello, welcome to Larung Pes.

01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:45.666
I can't wait to see Miss
Yayahh to dance with us.

01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:47.541
But you're going to change first, right?

01:23:47.625 --> 01:23:49.291
- Just go straight in.
- It's okay?

01:23:49.416 --> 01:23:51.541
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:24:05.562 --> 01:24:06.354
Hello.

01:24:06.523 --> 01:24:07.250
Bee One.

01:24:08.291 --> 01:24:10.042
Ready for instruction. Roger.

01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:11.483
What are you talking about, Yatno?

01:24:11.791 --> 01:24:13.083
Just go in.

01:24:13.375 --> 01:24:14.416
He's inside.

01:24:14.441 --> 01:24:15.483
Permission to get closer.

01:24:16.158 --> 01:24:19.033
We're going to go in. Okay?

01:24:19.125 --> 01:24:19.875
Over there...

01:24:19.984 --> 01:24:21.400
Which unit are you from?

01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:27.166
SOAP OPERA POLICE VERSUS REAL POLICE.

01:24:28.398 --> 01:24:29.106
Mr. Thomas.

01:24:31.791 --> 01:24:32.708
I'm Wawan.

01:24:35.541 --> 01:24:36.458
Where's Naya?

01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:38.166
Come with me.

01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:42.291
Nay.

01:24:42.316 --> 01:24:43.250
Your friend's here.

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:49.292
I'll wait for you outside.

01:24:51.408 --> 01:24:53.667
Naya, are you okay?

01:24:56.666 --> 01:24:57.958
Why did you run?

01:24:58.375 --> 01:25:01.483
You know I didn't kill Zul, right?

01:25:01.666 --> 01:25:04.000
Okay, honestly, I don't know.

01:25:04.166 --> 01:25:05.567
Let's just leave it to the police.

01:25:06.314 --> 01:25:07.526
I don't want to do that!

01:25:07.947 --> 01:25:09.322
I feel like I'm being framed!

01:25:09.416 --> 01:25:12.000
I've prepared an attorney. One of the best.

01:25:12.666 --> 01:25:14.000
I only need one thing from you.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.500
Sign the letter of authorization
to access all of Zul's bank accounts.

01:25:21.125 --> 01:25:22.583
All of our money is in there.

01:25:22.791 --> 01:25:24.667
You mean my money?

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:27.125
Most of it, yes.

01:25:27.291 --> 01:25:28.775
But we need that money.

01:25:29.174 --> 01:25:30.557
To pay for the attorney, for...

01:25:30.868 --> 01:25:31.952
I mean, look at this.

01:25:32.166 --> 01:25:33.375
You want to keep doing this?

01:25:36.916 --> 01:25:39.000
Wan...

01:25:39.625 --> 01:25:40.875
Yatno!

01:25:41.291 --> 01:25:42.833
Why did it take you so long?

01:25:43.541 --> 01:25:45.041
Are they the new politrons?

01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:47.041
Don't point your finger at us, be polite!

01:25:47.166 --> 01:25:51.208
Hey, if I haven't given you the dialogue,
don't talk. You're only an extra.

01:25:51.916 --> 01:25:53.125
Do you dare?

01:25:57.291 --> 01:25:59.416
Do you think people are
scared of this fake gun?

01:25:59.541 --> 01:26:02.250
Why are you scaring me with this fake gun?

01:26:02.291 --> 01:26:05.667
And this woman. Who asked
for a female police officer? I didn't.

01:26:06.666 --> 01:26:08.416
And she looks like a guy too.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:10.291
Is this real hair?

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.416
Oh, real woman.

01:26:25.416 --> 01:26:27.500
RECORDING...

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:30.805
Hey, wait a minute.

01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:33.900
I want to ask you a question.

01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:35.500
Okay.

01:26:36.243 --> 01:26:36.994
What?

01:26:37.666 --> 01:26:39.291
What did you put in my drink?

01:26:40.291 --> 01:26:42.291
Because after I had drank that...

01:26:42.375 --> 01:26:43.625
...I passed out.

01:26:43.916 --> 01:26:46.416
And when I woke up, Zul had been dead.

01:26:47.666 --> 01:26:49.041
Can you explain that to me?

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.791
Don't be mad at me, Nay.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:54.442
This is all Thomas' idea.

01:26:55.125 --> 01:26:57.916
Honestly, I'm fed up with Thomas.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
You should arrange the meeting
with Mr. Indra immediately.

01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:05.291
Mr. Indra is a greater
producer than Thomas.

01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:07.250
You're not suited to be Naya's manager.

01:27:07.291 --> 01:27:09.875
You're the one who
isn't suited. You never...

01:27:16.041 --> 01:27:17.708
Sorry about earlier.

01:27:18.041 --> 01:27:19.416
I was just trying to do my best.

01:27:21.291 --> 01:27:22.416
Drink this.

01:27:31.166 --> 01:27:32.791
- Answer me!
- I didn't put anything.

01:27:32.875 --> 01:27:34.666
- Tell me what you put in there!
- I didn't put anything, Nay!

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.875
- You're still lying?
- Stop it. Let's go.

01:27:37.141 --> 01:27:38.766
- I don't want to!
- Stop it. Let's...

01:27:38.791 --> 01:27:41.000
Human rights violation!

01:27:41.041 --> 01:27:42.791
Right on time.

01:27:42.875 --> 01:27:44.750
Mister Police, Madam Police...

01:27:45.267 --> 01:27:46.726
Naya has agreed to go back to Jakarta.

01:27:47.666 --> 01:27:49.635
No! It wasn't me who killed Zul.

01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:51.100
- Nay.
- I swear.

01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:53.366
- Let them prove that.
- It wasn't me. What are you talking about?

01:27:53.391 --> 01:27:55.266
- Nay.
- It wasn't Naya who killed Zul.

01:27:55.291 --> 01:27:56.250
See?

01:27:57.664 --> 01:27:59.016
Naya was the only one in the room.

01:27:59.041 --> 01:27:59.667
That's right.

01:28:00.791 --> 01:28:03.167
But you were well asleep
when it happened, right?

01:28:03.375 --> 01:28:04.875
I was, that's right.

01:28:05.281 --> 01:28:06.281
How do you know?

01:28:06.416 --> 01:28:09.583
The event was sponsored
by a mineral water brand...

01:28:09.861 --> 01:28:11.236
...Aquadius.

01:28:12.666 --> 01:28:15.625
But when we checked the crime scene...

01:28:15.666 --> 01:28:18.375
...there was a bottle of a different brand.

01:28:18.416 --> 01:28:19.833
Holi Wota.

01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:25.875
This brand is usually sold in one of
West Jakarta's clubs, The Arena Club.

01:28:26.125 --> 01:28:30.166
This Arena Club is also a place
that sells different kinds of drugs.

01:28:30.291 --> 01:28:32.875
He often goes there. You go there often.

01:28:32.916 --> 01:28:34.317
- I know you!
- Stop making slander.

01:28:35.166 --> 01:28:37.125
What does that bottle
have to do with this case?

01:28:37.252 --> 01:28:38.961
We saw the liquid inside a bit murky.

01:28:39.166 --> 01:28:42.375
So we brought the bottle to the lab
to check the content.

01:28:42.791 --> 01:28:46.291
And the result was as we expected.

01:28:46.444 --> 01:28:51.069
The water inside the bottle
had a high dose of sedative.

01:28:52.032 --> 01:28:53.032
Here's the thing, Naya.

01:28:53.125 --> 01:28:56.375
Drug users consume the drug directly.

01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:59.125
They don't crush the
drug and mix it with water.

01:28:59.416 --> 01:29:03.541
Unless they want to drug
someone else not in the know.

01:29:03.625 --> 01:29:06.000
My commander is amazing.

01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:14.000
Our lab also found another thing.

01:29:14.375 --> 01:29:15.875
A fingerprint.

01:29:16.416 --> 01:29:17.458
Yours.

01:29:18.416 --> 01:29:22.250
So, it's enough evidence
to ask for a search warrant.

01:29:22.291 --> 01:29:25.916
And we did search your house earlier today.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.875
Our team found a knife
still covered in Zul's blood.

01:29:29.916 --> 01:29:31.666
See?

01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:32.791
Stop!

01:29:32.816 --> 01:29:33.586
Naya!

01:29:33.611 --> 01:29:35.333
What are you doing?
Let me go!

01:29:35.666 --> 01:29:38.250
Ma'am, I don't want to die.
Help me.

01:29:38.291 --> 01:29:40.041
Wan, help me.

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:41.666
Don't you see I'm being held?

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:43.791
Can't you do anything?

01:29:43.875 --> 01:29:46.375
I'm praying for you right now.

01:29:46.416 --> 01:29:48.416
- Don't play around!
- Praying is not playing around.

01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:49.916
Can you shut your mouth?

01:29:55.791 --> 01:29:56.750
Quick.

01:29:58.916 --> 01:30:01.291
Make way. Help us, Sir.

01:30:01.375 --> 01:30:02.625
Slowly.

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:08.916
Naya. We'll be waiting for you in Jakarta
to conclude the investigation report.

01:30:08.941 --> 01:30:09.716
Yes, Ma'am.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.279
Go.

01:30:11.304 --> 01:30:13.263
- Escort them.
- Sir. Sorry.

01:30:13.666 --> 01:30:16.192
He is my politron.

01:30:16.541 --> 01:30:17.791
Just go away!

01:30:19.041 --> 01:30:22.041
If you mess around with fake
police once again, I'll arrest you.

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:23.167
Yes, Sir.

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:24.875
Yes, Ma'am.

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:27.458
- You're spitting on me.
- Let's go, Zaki.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.167
Bye, Sir.

01:30:29.875 --> 01:30:32.000
Let's go in. We have to perform.

01:30:44.916 --> 01:30:46.916
Who doesn't know this person?

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:50.625
A living legend of the
national dangdut music scene.

01:30:50.766 --> 01:30:52.016
I present you...

01:30:52.041 --> 01:30:56.541
...Rizal Maduma from Senandung Citayam!

01:31:04.916 --> 01:31:12.500
Rizal!

01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:15.901
Not yet.

01:31:15.926 --> 01:31:17.051
Hey!

01:31:18.666 --> 01:31:20.833
So eager.

01:31:21.166 --> 01:31:24.150
- We can't wait anymore.
- So eager.

01:31:24.541 --> 01:31:29.375
As per my tradition
since a long time ago...

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:36.833
...I will introduce a new talent
in the dangdut music scene.

01:31:38.791 --> 01:31:41.166
After Iis Maduma!

01:31:42.666 --> 01:31:44.625
Ipeh Ratu Bucin.

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.375
Uti Goyangintil.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:50.292
Now, get ready...

01:31:50.375 --> 01:31:52.750
...for a future star.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.198
Whi is that?

01:31:56.791 --> 01:31:57.542
Yayahh!

01:31:57.617 --> 01:31:59.783
- Yayahh.
- Miss, stop.

01:32:00.164 --> 01:32:02.100
Sir, you can go. I'll catch up.

01:32:02.125 --> 01:32:03.692
- Okay, I'll leave first.
- Okay.

01:32:04.416 --> 01:32:06.291
- Rio, wait here for a while, okay?
- What?

01:32:08.125 --> 01:32:09.166
Yah...

01:32:10.416 --> 01:32:12.916
I want to have a quick chat with you.

01:32:13.041 --> 01:32:14.666
You want to argue with me again?

01:32:15.916 --> 01:32:18.916
About that, I'm sorry.

01:32:20.916 --> 01:32:22.317
Okay, I forgive you.

01:32:22.791 --> 01:32:24.666
Thanks, Yah.

01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:27.000
And I want to ask for your help.

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.375
Just one thing.

01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:30.791
Rio, come here.

01:32:34.291 --> 01:32:35.000
Yah...

01:32:35.916 --> 01:32:38.791
...please bring my son on stage.

01:32:39.839 --> 01:32:40.519
What?

01:32:41.166 --> 01:32:43.000
I promised him...

01:32:43.375 --> 01:32:46.000
...that I would bring him with me on stage.

01:32:46.541 --> 01:32:49.042
But because I'm not going to perform...

01:32:49.916 --> 01:32:52.416
...I can't keep my promise.

01:32:56.291 --> 01:32:58.416
I'm not a great parent.

01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:01.125
Far from it.

01:33:02.916 --> 01:33:05.291
That's why I'm asking for your help.

01:33:06.914 --> 01:33:09.333
Please bring him on stage with you, Yah...

01:33:10.916 --> 01:33:13.416
...so he won't be disappointed at me.

01:33:15.041 --> 01:33:17.916
He really wants to watch the performance
from the stage.

01:33:25.125 --> 01:33:26.750
Help me.

01:33:33.625 --> 01:33:35.916
Let's call...

01:33:37.791 --> 01:33:40.541
...Yayahh Aduduh!

01:33:40.625 --> 01:33:42.666
Yayah!

01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:50.541
Yayah!

01:34:07.666 --> 01:34:11.416
Good evening, Larung Pes.

01:34:11.541 --> 01:34:14.125
Let me hear it, Larung Pes!

01:34:16.789 --> 01:34:18.292
Really like the spirit.

01:34:19.416 --> 01:34:21.416
Guys...

01:34:21.541 --> 01:34:23.291
Come sing with me!

01:35:39.291 --> 01:35:40.625
Don't step on the cable.

01:35:40.666 --> 01:35:45.000
Who wants a surprise?

01:35:45.041 --> 01:35:50.000
Give it up for Tata Ria Buana!

01:35:52.166 --> 01:35:55.666
Tata!

01:35:57.416 --> 01:35:58.666
Rio!

01:35:59.791 --> 01:36:01.125
Music!

01:36:33.375 --> 01:36:35.041
Rio!

01:36:35.087 --> 01:36:37.337
I'm performing at Larung Pes!

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:38.750
Come here!

01:37:07.875 --> 01:37:09.875
Let's go home to Jakarta.

01:38:06.875 --> 01:38:08.750
Dad doesn't recognize us anymore.

01:38:12.666 --> 01:38:13.792
Yes.

01:38:26.291 --> 01:38:28.500
I want to apologize to him.

01:38:34.916 --> 01:38:36.333
I can't, can I?

01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:43.041
It's okay. Let's just go home.

01:38:55.392 --> 01:38:56.209
Naya.

01:38:58.541 --> 01:38:59.875
I have an idea.

01:39:12.875 --> 01:39:15.166
Thank you!

01:39:19.125 --> 01:39:21.416
Thank you, Yayah!

01:39:21.441 --> 01:39:22.650
Congrats'!

01:39:24.416 --> 01:39:25.666
You can do it.

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:30.166
Dad?

01:41:31.375 --> 01:41:32.916
Dad, do you remember me?

01:41:34.041 --> 01:41:35.666
Yes.

01:41:35.791 --> 01:41:37.791
Lauralei.

01:41:37.875 --> 01:41:40.041
My beautiful youngest daughter.

01:41:58.291 --> 01:41:59.416
Hold this.

01:42:02.625 --> 01:42:05.042
Dad. It's Naya here.

01:42:15.166 --> 01:42:18.041
Dad. I'm Naya. Do you remember me?

01:42:18.125 --> 01:42:19.666
Naya.

01:42:19.791 --> 01:42:21.083
Yes.

01:42:22.125 --> 01:42:24.000
Naya!

01:42:34.166 --> 01:42:37.000
Dad, I'm sorry.

01:42:38.916 --> 01:42:40.625
I love you.

01:43:12.125 --> 01:43:18.250
SIX MONTHS LATER

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:32.458
Nurse, where are you taking me?

01:43:32.689 --> 01:43:34.625
Do you forget?

01:43:34.845 --> 01:43:38.792
Every Saturday,
there's a musical performance at the park.

01:43:40.579 --> 01:43:41.375
Yes.

01:44:12.166 --> 01:44:14.667
What's the name of the singer?

01:44:15.125 --> 01:44:16.666
Nayara...

01:44:16.791 --> 01:44:17.916
...Amalia...

01:44:18.041 --> 01:44:19.166
...Wardhani.

01:44:19.291 --> 01:44:20.500
Naya.

01:44:21.666 --> 01:44:23.541
Such a beautiful name.

01:45:36.642 --> 01:45:38.767
Be patient, Wan. Five more minutes.

01:45:40.166 --> 01:45:41.416
We have a lot of stuff here.

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:44.000
Where's your curly-haired friend
who often helps us carrying our stuff?

01:45:44.163 --> 01:45:46.579
My friend? He's your friend!

01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:48.708
You're kidding.

01:45:49.291 --> 01:45:51.000
So, whose friend is that? Yours?

01:45:51.633 --> 01:45:52.500
What?

01:45:52.666 --> 01:45:53.750
I don't know.

01:45:54.041 --> 01:45:55.500
He's not your friends?

01:46:04.916 --> 01:46:06.291
So, who is he?

01:46:06.375 --> 01:46:07.833
Wait, who am I?
