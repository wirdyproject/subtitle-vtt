WEBVTT

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:48.708
Tonight, I'm all alone

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:56.125
Counting on lonely hearts

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:03.666
Reminiscing about our love story

00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:09.458
Is there any hope for us?

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:11.708
What do you think?
I told you it'll be fine.

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:14.333
But we shouldn't do it like this,

00:01:14.416 --> 00:01:17.083
recording a song without proper lyrics.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.416
Hey.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.416
It's fresh from the oven.

00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:23.125
I was involved
in brainstorming the lyrics.

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.541
Even the second verse contains
a lot of my ideas.

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:26.500
It's good, right?

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:29.250
But as you know,

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.916
we have to submit the song
for mixing by tomorrow.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.250
My heart is shattered

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.500
As if run over by a car

00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:43.791
A broken car

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:50.875
Now where should I go

00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:57.750
To fix my flat tire of hope?

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.375
I can't continue singing this.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:09.500
But we have to submit
the song by tomorrow.

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:12.375
But the lyrics are absurd.

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:15.083
I get the music, but not the lyrics.

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:16.458
Cha, please.

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:19.083
Please try to feel the lyrics more.

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.625
The analogy is really good.

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:22.375
No one has ever used
that analogy before, you know.

00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:24.250
Then you two, go ahead
and sing this song yourselves.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:25.458
I can't.

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:29.791
Hold on.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:31.291
Wait.

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:35.333
Hey, tell me the truth.

00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:37.208
The lyrics are awesome, right?

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:44.791
I know it's awesome, right?

00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:48.625
Ms. Ocha, are you sure
you can't sing that song?

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:51.375
You heard it yourself, the music is good,

00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.291
but the lyrics are absurd.

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:58.958
Comparing love to fixing a car,

00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:01.375
at the auto repair shop, filling up hope.

00:03:01.458 --> 00:03:03.833
What's romantic about that?
I don't want it.

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:06.958
Yeah, it's probably romantic
to a mechanic, Ms. Ocha.

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.791
Just stick to driving, Yan!

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:10.250
Then what do we do?

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:12.625
We have to submit the song by tomorrow.

00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:14.333
We'd disappoint Mr. Andi

00:03:14.416 --> 00:03:16.833
if we sent the song
to Flagship Pictures too late.

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:19.333
What do we do?

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:21.458
Ms. Ocha.

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.125
I have one,
if you're looking for a good song.

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:26.041
Play it then.

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:27.208
Wait a minute.

00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:32.541
Then I will be fine

00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:40.083
Just hoping this hurt will subside

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:45.208
Even though I slowly forget

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:50.500
The sound of your voice that ever existed

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:53.583
When I was fine

00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:58.500
It's really good.

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:01.500
The song lyrics are beautiful and rare.

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:04.000
Who wrote this, Yan?

00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:05.708
Well, it's my friend's song.

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:07.875
His name is Kawidra.

00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.375
But…

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:11.375
It's a long story, Ms. Ocha.

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:14.875
So, do you want to help or not?

00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.375
I have a friend.

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:18.166
Her name is Sekar.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.625
She can tell you more about the song.

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:22.041
Where is she now?

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:23.750
She's at her shop in the BSD area.

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:26.125
Let's just head there now.

00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:27.458
BSD is not that far, right?

00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:28.416
Okay, miss.

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:34.083
Sekar!

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.541
Yandy, what brings you here so late?

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:42.916
It's not me.

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.083
Ms. Ocha!

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:51.958
So that's why we're here.

00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:54.833
Ms. Ocha wants to use K's song
for her recording sessions tomorrow.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.083
Why don't we just meet the songwriter?

00:05:00.708 --> 00:05:02.958
Surely he would let me sing his song?

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.916
So, it's like this.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.875
The songwriters are

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.458
Kawidra and Clarissa,

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:13.875
better known as K and Cream.

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:18.833
Cream, the lyricist for Rise Records?

00:05:18.916 --> 00:05:19.875
Yeah.

00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.666
The Rise Records?

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.333
I'm familiar with them.

00:05:23.416 --> 00:05:26.041
Why don't we go meet them now?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.625
K has passed away, Ms. Ocha.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.333
And we don't know where Cream is.

00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:36.875
What does that mean?

00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:41.583
Yandy and I have known K for a long time.

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:49.041
He told us everything before he died.

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:10.541
ST. WENCESLAUS HIGH SCHOOL

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.416
You ran as if chased by a ghost.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.916
Tired?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.208
Here, drink this.

00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:58.916
Hey!

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.083
Why aren't you two in class?

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:06.958
How dare you smoke in school?

00:07:10.416 --> 00:07:12.708
You skipped class
and you even got caught smoking.

00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:14.291
What will you be when you grow up?

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:19.458
We are aware that
you recently lost your dad and mom

00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:21.000
in a short period of time.

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:23.458
But skipping classes

00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:25.000
and smoking at school

00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:27.958
are not the answer.

00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:31.083
If you need to talk to a counsellor,

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:33.541
the school could assist.

00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:36.791
Sir, in my opinion,
before seeing a counselor…

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:47.791
Hey!

00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:51.750
You're mad, aren't you?

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:55.333
Yeah. I almost got punished
because of you.

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:57.416
Hey, you're the one
who skipped class, not me.

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:01.833
I knew you wouldn't be punished

00:08:01.916 --> 00:08:03.500
because you recently became an orphan.

00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:09.541
I just became one too.

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:12.083
Let's grab some chicken noodles.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:14.083
Come on, it's on me.

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:16.166
You're a penniless orphan, right?
Let's go!

00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:18.416
Try it!

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.333
These are the best chicken noodles
in the world.

00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:24.041
You have to try them.
That's why I brought you here.

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:26.750
Ever since then,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.833
Clarissa has been my one and only friend.

00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:32.333
Both at school

00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:34.916
and outside.

00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:43.625
We both didn't have anyone anymore.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.333
We also have the same hobby.

00:08:49.541 --> 00:08:50.833
What did I tell you?

00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:54.625
When a popular kid is sad,
a lot of people rush to their side.

00:08:55.208 --> 00:08:56.500
They'll offer their sympathy.

00:08:56.583 --> 00:08:59.166
But when it's a nobody like us,
nobody cares!

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:02.791
Thankfully you have me.

00:09:09.208 --> 00:09:10.791
-Here are some ice creams.
-Yes, sir!

00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:12.375
You want it too, right?

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:13.958
No. I don't have money.

00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:14.916
Here, take it.

00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:19.500
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:22.250
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.666
Give me the potion.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.166
Wait a minute.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.958
Come on, right now!

00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:38.166
Here it is.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.666
Like that.

00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:51.583
It takes forever for you
to make that song.

00:09:51.666 --> 00:09:53.500
I get the music,

00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:55.958
but I'm not good at writing lyrics.

00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:58.625
You should've said something.
Here, let me do it!

00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:00.458
Can you actually write the lyrics?

00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:01.708
Of course!

00:10:01.791 --> 00:10:05.250
I write pages of things
in my diary every day.

00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:07.541
Writing song lyrics
shouldn't be that hard, it's quite easy.

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:10.125
Do you want to hear how it sounds?

00:10:10.833 --> 00:10:11.708
Sure!

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:27.875
Here, it's done.

00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:30.250
Take a look.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.041
Do you like it?

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.791
Don't you want to be
a professional lyricist?

00:10:42.166 --> 00:10:43.916
Let's keep on writing songs together then.

00:10:46.666 --> 00:10:47.541
All right.

00:10:52.708 --> 00:10:54.666
I'll give it a try.

00:10:56.375 --> 00:10:57.250
Sure, let's try.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:09.125
From now on,
let's capture important moments

00:11:09.208 --> 00:11:11.750
in our lives
with this Polaroid camera, okay?

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:12.708
Let's take a picture.

00:11:12.791 --> 00:11:16.666
With Clarissa, high school flew by.

00:11:22.791 --> 00:11:25.750
It's sad that such a cute dog
has no one to care for it.

00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:29.291
If not the young ones
who care and volunteer,

00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:30.875
-then who else, right?
-Yeah.

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.083
Thank you for helping out again.
I'm going inside.

00:11:33.166 --> 00:11:34.041
Okay, doctor.

00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:36.625
By the way, what major
are you going to study in college?

00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:38.875
I don't really know yet.

00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.916
Then take the same as me, marketing.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.875
Why should I?

00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:43.625
It's cheap.

00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:46.958
It's not that hard to pass the classes.
Then we're off to find a job.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:49.125
Why not skip college
and go straight to work?

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.625
You're so stupid!

00:11:50.708 --> 00:11:53.250
Nowadays, even college graduates
get paid in chump change.

00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.250
A high school graduate often earns
below minimum wage.

00:12:03.666 --> 00:12:07.583
Today, we will discuss
market segmentation.

00:12:08.791 --> 00:12:11.291
Is there anyone here

00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:15.416
who can give an example of
what market segmentation is like?

00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:17.625
Please raise your hand.

00:12:19.125 --> 00:12:20.541
Let's move to the next material.

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:22.416
First point.

00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:26.791
Operational management
can be interpreted as

00:12:26.875 --> 00:12:31.083
a series of activities that include…

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:36.041
Operational management
can be interpreted as

00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:39.458
a series of activities that include…

00:12:39.541 --> 00:12:41.083
College tuition is expensive.

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:42.458
We might as well
throw our money down the drain.

00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:44.625
Don't be so dramatic.

00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:46.708
We're just here to get our degree.

00:12:46.791 --> 00:12:48.250
Do you want to work in marketing?

00:12:49.416 --> 00:12:51.041
So, don't complain.

00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:52.666
Hey, where are we going?

00:12:57.291 --> 00:13:00.083
Wait, your birthday was last week.

00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:01.541
October 18th.

00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:03.083
Yeah.

00:13:03.166 --> 00:13:06.250
And your birthday is next week, right?
October 31st.

00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:10.458
From now on,
we'll celebrate our birthdays together.

00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:11.416
Cost-effective.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.666
Yours gets moved forward a week
and mine is pushed back

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.833
to October 25th.

00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:16.916
Right in between.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.833
That's not right.
You can't just push your birthday date.

00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:21.250
You could shorten your age.

00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:23.958
Come on,
you still believe in that kind of stuff.

00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:26.583
Do you want to celebrate or not?

00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:30.166
All right then.

00:13:33.291 --> 00:13:34.791
Do you need help?

00:13:35.416 --> 00:13:36.291
Sure!

00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:45.083
Let's make a wish together.

00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.166
Let me cut the cake.

00:14:21.916 --> 00:14:23.208
-Two ice creams?
-How much are they?

00:14:23.291 --> 00:14:24.750
-It's 20,000.
-20,000.

00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.791
-Thank you!
-Thank you, sir.

00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:30.083
Here, let me open it.

00:14:31.916 --> 00:14:33.916
Oh no, it's raining.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.083
Let's go over there.

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.125
-Thank you, sir!
-Yes, thank you.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.875
-It's pouring.
-Yeah.

00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:48.875
Let's just go to my apartment.
It's not too far from here.

00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:50.583
Sure.

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:52.791
Let's go.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.291
Thank you.

00:14:58.375 --> 00:14:59.250
You're welcome.

00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:11.916
Your apartment is so messy.

00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.416
Well, I have been living alone.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.125
I don't have time to clean up.

00:15:20.791 --> 00:15:22.208
There are also

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.375
many of my parents' belongings left,
especially my dad's.

00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:27.250
Why don't you just throw them away?

00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:28.750
Nobody's using them anyway.

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:34.958
Is it still hard to let go?

00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:48.125
I have an idea.
This is a two-bedroom apartment, right?

00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:49.916
Yeah.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.500
How about I become your roommate?

00:15:52.416 --> 00:15:53.291
What do you mean?

00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:54.708
I'll stay here.

00:15:55.458 --> 00:15:56.541
I know, but…

00:15:56.625 --> 00:15:58.375
We've got to be resourceful.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:01.750
We're living off our savings
and inheritance,

00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:03.291
so we need to cut back!

00:16:03.916 --> 00:16:05.708
Yeah, but…

00:16:05.791 --> 00:16:09.000
I'll sell my family's house
and deposit the money in the bank

00:16:09.083 --> 00:16:10.458
when I get the earnings from the sale.

00:16:11.083 --> 00:16:12.958
I'll pay you rent every month
so you'll have some extra income.

00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:19.166
-But…
-Don't you know the law of economics?

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.750
Do you ever listen in class?

00:16:20.833 --> 00:16:22.500
You're the one
who always makes me skip class.

00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:25.416
Don't you want me to be your roommate?

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.458
One more thing.

00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:32.875
What else?

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.583
Your name sounds odd.

00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:36.791
Kawidra.

00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:39.083
What is that?

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:41.041
My dad gave me that name.

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:42.083
If I'm not wrong,

00:16:42.708 --> 00:16:45.666
it means a man with a sense of art.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.291
Right, the meaning is nice.

00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:51.000
But it still sounds bad.
What should we call you then?

00:16:51.666 --> 00:16:52.916
Kawi?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.875
Dra?

00:16:56.083 --> 00:16:57.000
So weird.

00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:02.291
From now on, I'll just call you K.

00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:03.375
Kay?

00:17:03.458 --> 00:17:05.500
No! Not Kay!

00:17:06.333 --> 00:17:07.250
Just the letter "K."

00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:08.500
-K?
-Yeah.

00:17:08.583 --> 00:17:09.750
The letter "K."

00:17:12.458 --> 00:17:14.875
To make it even, I'll change my name too.

00:17:15.708 --> 00:17:17.416
From now on, you can call me Cream.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.875
Cream?

00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.208
-Yeah.
-Why Cream?

00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:21.708
Because I love ice cream!

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.041
Why not Ice?

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.416
K, please!

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.500
Doesn't your apartment look nice now?

00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:12.250
Our apartment.

00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:18.000
If I weren't around,
what would you have become?

00:18:20.791 --> 00:18:21.875
Probably dead?

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.958
Don't say that!

00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:29.875
By the way,
why haven't you made any songs lately?

00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:30.833
Why?

00:18:32.458 --> 00:18:35.250
I'm an orphan and poor.

00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:36.541
I have no connection.

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:38.750
Pursuing a career in music?

00:18:39.875 --> 00:18:41.041
It's impossible.

00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:44.541
Come on. Even having a dream
is complicated with you.

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:45.958
Not complicated.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.666
It's realistic.

00:18:48.791 --> 00:18:50.416
It's hard enough
to make a living on your own.

00:18:51.458 --> 00:18:52.750
Let alone dream big like that.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.708
It makes me feel like
an ungrateful person.

00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:58.833
Hey, having a dream is free!
Dream as big as you want!

00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:02.375
That's fine.

00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:03.500
If you don't have the guts,

00:19:04.208 --> 00:19:06.458
I'll be a songwriter.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.500
When I make it big,

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:11.833
I will take you with me.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.875
We will write songs together.

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:20.500
Let's take a picture!

00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:25.500
All important moments must be captured
with the Polaroid camera.

00:19:29.708 --> 00:19:30.875
Why Polaroid?

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.666
Because everything in life
goes by so fast,

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.250
but memories last forever.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.916
Like this camera.

00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:47.916
The process is quick,
but the result lasts forever.

00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:50.041
Like our memories.

00:19:56.666 --> 00:19:58.458
You're good with words.

00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:00.875
I'm pretty sure

00:20:01.916 --> 00:20:04.166
you will become a famous songwriter.

00:20:05.416 --> 00:20:06.291
Amen.

00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:20.916
So what's your take?
Did Taylor Swift's new album move you?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.125
It's quite different
from her previous albums.

00:20:25.208 --> 00:20:27.500
The songs in this one are kind of heavy.

00:20:28.833 --> 00:20:31.541
But I feel like Swifties
won't mind at all.

00:20:34.125 --> 00:20:35.125
So should we go for that?

00:20:36.541 --> 00:20:38.708
It seems we're all Swifties.

00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:41.375
Okay then.
Yandy, please proceed with the plan.

00:20:44.625 --> 00:20:45.458
Sekar.

00:20:47.208 --> 00:20:48.708
How are you doing now with your dad?

00:20:52.041 --> 00:20:53.125
Well, same old, same old.

00:20:53.833 --> 00:20:58.208
He said there's no future
in music in Indonesia.

00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:00.500
But I'm still confused.

00:21:00.583 --> 00:21:02.500
Why can't he ever understand me?

00:21:02.583 --> 00:21:03.458
When I was a kid,

00:21:03.541 --> 00:21:06.250
it was actually his vinyl records
that got me into music.

00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:08.541
If I may suggest,

00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:13.250
try taking him to a concert
of your favorite band.

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:14.875
Or now it's your turn

00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:19.166
to bring him to a vinyl shop
and show him the songs you love.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.125
Make him see your world.

00:21:21.208 --> 00:21:25.333
Show him that the music business today
is so different from his time.

00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:29.000
Nothing is permanent in this world,

00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:30.625
so don't regret it later

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:33.583
when they're gone.

00:21:37.458 --> 00:21:38.458
Let's grab dinner.

00:21:44.416 --> 00:21:45.625
Didn't you say
you have a recording session?

00:21:45.708 --> 00:21:47.875
Yes, it's done! The singer's amazing.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.375
Is the singer talented
or are you the talented one?

00:21:50.458 --> 00:21:51.500
Both of us.

00:21:52.041 --> 00:21:53.375
All right, let me tidy up first.

00:21:57.416 --> 00:21:59.333
I thought you were
taking me out for dinner.

00:21:59.416 --> 00:22:00.833
Turns out, we're eating
a home-cooked meal.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.750
Hey, this is more cost-effective
than eating out all the time.

00:22:03.833 --> 00:22:05.791
It's not like you're loaded.

00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:09.291
Still, you said it was dinner.

00:22:09.375 --> 00:22:11.083
So you should've made something special.

00:22:11.166 --> 00:22:12.333
Not just instant noodles.

00:22:12.416 --> 00:22:14.875
This is special, K.

00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:16.958
I made it. Isn't it special for you?

00:22:17.041 --> 00:22:18.291
It is.

00:22:19.458 --> 00:22:21.416
But next time, don't bring up my salary.

00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:23.250
Why? Are you offended?

00:22:23.333 --> 00:22:25.458
It's a fact that
paychecks at radio stations are small.

00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:27.916
You were offered a marketing job
at P&G and you turned it down.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.583
Music is my passion.
I don't want to work in marketing.

00:22:30.666 --> 00:22:34.666
But you didn't have the guts
to be a full-time songwriter too.

00:22:35.291 --> 00:22:36.208
What do you want then?

00:22:36.291 --> 00:22:38.916
I work at a radio station,
and the pay is just enough.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.166
How could I possibly work
just by writing songs?

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.666
I did. I made good money

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.166
as a lyricist at Rise Records.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.541
They pay me quite well.

00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:49.208
Yeah, sure.

00:22:49.291 --> 00:22:53.583
Cream, the best lyricist
in Indonesia right now.

00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:56.708
Not yet.

00:22:56.791 --> 00:22:57.791
But I will be.

00:22:59.041 --> 00:23:00.000
I'm so full.

00:23:00.958 --> 00:23:02.250
Very confident.

00:23:04.333 --> 00:23:06.541
In our industry,
if we don't have the confidence,

00:23:06.625 --> 00:23:09.166
those singers would underestimate you.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.166
I can picture it.

00:23:10.916 --> 00:23:12.750
You writing lyrics to a legendary song

00:23:12.833 --> 00:23:14.541
that becomes an all-time legacy.

00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:17.166
I'm still young,
don't get ahead of ourselves

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:18.375
and talk about legacy.

00:23:18.458 --> 00:23:19.958
Sounds like you're about to die.

00:23:20.041 --> 00:23:21.333
That's not it.

00:23:21.416 --> 00:23:22.958
The thing is,

00:23:23.041 --> 00:23:25.291
there are a lot of musicians
who died young.

00:23:25.833 --> 00:23:27.750
For example, Kurt Cobain.

00:23:27.833 --> 00:23:29.041
Janis Joplin.

00:23:29.125 --> 00:23:30.041
Tupac.

00:23:30.125 --> 00:23:31.583
Wouldn't it be cool?

00:23:31.666 --> 00:23:32.958
For me,

00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:34.875
living a short life, but making an impact

00:23:34.958 --> 00:23:38.250
is way cooler than living to old age
with nothing to show for it.

00:23:39.583 --> 00:23:40.875
What are you saying?

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:42.875
Come here!

00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:45.708
Don't you dare die young
and leave me all alone.

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:47.000
-It hurts!
-You can't leave me alone!

00:23:47.083 --> 00:23:48.250
No, I'm not!

00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:50.291
-You can go after I'm gone.
-No…

00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:52.375
It's not like we have control
over life and death, Cream.

00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:54.708
It hurts!

00:23:54.791 --> 00:23:56.541
Would you like it if I did the same thing?

00:23:57.083 --> 00:23:58.041
Don't you dare!

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.458
Don't leave me alone.

00:24:01.541 --> 00:24:02.583
Are you sulking?

00:25:19.625 --> 00:25:20.875
It's cancer, isn't it?

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.625
Didn't I tell you a long time ago?

00:25:25.583 --> 00:25:28.333
You have cancer in your genes.

00:25:29.041 --> 00:25:31.375
So you need regular checkups.

00:25:32.458 --> 00:25:34.291
When symptoms reach this stage,

00:25:34.375 --> 00:25:36.750
it means you're in Stage IV,

00:25:37.916 --> 00:25:38.916
the final stage.

00:25:40.583 --> 00:25:42.208
It's a rare cancer.

00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:45.625
Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

00:25:45.708 --> 00:25:47.791
It has spread
to the soft tissues, forming a sarcoma.

00:25:47.875 --> 00:25:51.916
Chemotherapy is unlikely to be effective
for this type of cancer.

00:25:53.333 --> 00:25:54.666
But since you're still young,

00:25:56.083 --> 00:25:57.125
we should give it a shot.

00:26:02.625 --> 00:26:04.208
How long do I have?

00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:06.958
In medical terms, probably…

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:09.166
A year.

00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:23.583
Hi, may I help you?

00:26:23.666 --> 00:26:24.916
Here's the thing, Mr. Aldy.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Turning a new singer into a star
isn't an easy job.

00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:29.208
It needs a process.

00:26:36.041 --> 00:26:36.916
All right.

00:26:37.666 --> 00:26:39.000
How much do you need?

00:26:39.083 --> 00:26:40.333
For Momo,

00:26:40.416 --> 00:26:43.000
I'll pay whatever it costs.

00:26:43.083 --> 00:26:44.875
This is not about money, sir.

00:26:44.958 --> 00:26:46.708
We all need a process.

00:26:46.791 --> 00:26:50.958
We can't force people
to like a song or a singer.

00:26:51.041 --> 00:26:52.333
Look.

00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:56.958
If we make a great song,

00:26:57.041 --> 00:27:00.875
and we keep airing it
on the radio over and over,

00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:03.000
I believe

00:27:03.666 --> 00:27:04.791
people will love it anyway.

00:27:04.875 --> 00:27:06.666
-But Mr. Aldy…
-Okay.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.208
Mr. Aldy, we can give it a try, okay?

00:27:09.958 --> 00:27:11.375
But as I said,

00:27:11.458 --> 00:27:15.333
making an album
with Rise Records is not cheap.

00:27:17.166 --> 00:27:18.541
I'll pay for everything.

00:27:20.875 --> 00:27:22.041
Thank you, darling.

00:27:22.666 --> 00:27:23.625
You're the best!

00:27:25.625 --> 00:27:27.541
You're ghosting

00:27:28.708 --> 00:27:30.958
Your feelings are fake

00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:34.250
You're the one

00:27:35.291 --> 00:27:37.875
Who flirts with me

00:27:38.625 --> 00:27:40.666
You make me can't move on

00:27:41.958 --> 00:27:44.041
Really make me can't move on

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.375
You make me crazy

00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:51.041
Send shivers down my spine

00:27:55.083 --> 00:27:55.958
What's wrong?

00:27:57.708 --> 00:27:59.083
Calm down, sir.

00:27:59.166 --> 00:28:00.125
Why did you stop it?

00:28:00.208 --> 00:28:01.541
What happened to the lyrics?

00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:04.250
Yeah.

00:28:04.333 --> 00:28:08.708
I had to tweak some parts
to fit my personality.

00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:09.666
Let me take a look.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.708
Hey, here's the thing.

00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:16.416
If you change the lyrics for the better,
then that's fine.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.041
But this is unacceptable.
You turned them into cheesy lyrics.

00:28:18.125 --> 00:28:19.708
This is an embarrassment for me!

00:28:19.791 --> 00:28:21.541
I'm credited as the lyricist.

00:28:21.625 --> 00:28:23.541
What do you mean it's cheesy?
This is what's trending!

00:28:23.625 --> 00:28:26.250
You don't know anything
about Gen Z's taste.

00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:28.375
Fine, then write your own lyrics
for the entire song.

00:28:28.458 --> 00:28:29.458
Don't use my name.

00:28:35.541 --> 00:28:36.833
What the hell is this?

00:28:36.916 --> 00:28:39.083
I paid a lot of money for this!

00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:41.125
Yes, sir. Calm down.

00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:54.583
A rookie dared to criticize my lyrics!

00:29:04.625 --> 00:29:06.291
Are you playing hide and seek?

00:29:08.875 --> 00:29:10.166
Where is Cream?

00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:13.250
I can't see her.

00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:20.833
I still can see you, Cream.

00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:23.916
Hey.

00:29:26.333 --> 00:29:27.666
What happened to you?

00:29:30.125 --> 00:29:32.125
Tell me what's going on.

00:29:35.875 --> 00:29:36.791
What is it?

00:29:37.666 --> 00:29:39.416
I got into a fight at the office.

00:29:41.125 --> 00:29:43.708
There's this new singer
who ignorantly changed my lyrics.

00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:46.000
Momo?

00:29:48.208 --> 00:29:49.291
How do you know?

00:29:51.958 --> 00:29:53.583
Rizal called me.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.750
He said you just stormed out
of a recording session.

00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:05.291
Hey. Come on.

00:30:08.708 --> 00:30:10.041
Don't think about that.

00:30:10.125 --> 00:30:11.833
Newcomers are always cocky.

00:30:11.916 --> 00:30:13.208
They don't understand
how the industry works.

00:30:16.458 --> 00:30:19.041
But you have to be careful
with her boyfriend

00:30:19.666 --> 00:30:20.958
because they said

00:30:21.541 --> 00:30:22.750
her boyfriend is a gangster.

00:30:23.375 --> 00:30:24.458
A real gangster?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.250
Just make peace with Momo tomorrow

00:30:29.208 --> 00:30:31.375
and write the lyrics together.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.333
I don't want to.

00:30:33.416 --> 00:30:34.875
I'm not willing to.

00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:37.166
Didn't you say music is your passion?

00:30:38.583 --> 00:30:40.083
You're really giving up that easily?

00:30:43.791 --> 00:30:44.958
Hug?

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:01.416
I'm so sorry, Cream.

00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:04.625
Yeah, me too.

00:31:04.708 --> 00:31:06.916
I'm so sorry
for getting emotional yesterday.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.541
No worries. I was being rude.

00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:14.291
Oh, yeah. By the way,

00:31:14.375 --> 00:31:17.291
I just found out about
the kind of lyrics you wrote

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:18.875
and they're all really good.

00:31:18.958 --> 00:31:20.875
I haven't written that many songs.

00:31:20.958 --> 00:31:23.166
Yeah, but I like them all.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.083
I could really feel the emotions
in the lyrics. They're so deep.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.041
So that's settled then.
You girls stay at peace.

00:31:31.666 --> 00:31:33.625
No more fighting.

00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:36.791
It gives me a headache!

00:31:38.333 --> 00:31:40.208
Oh, darling.

00:32:05.208 --> 00:32:09.791
You're going to experience
blackouts like this more frequently.

00:32:10.791 --> 00:32:12.458
You need to be more careful.

00:32:12.541 --> 00:32:13.791
But…

00:32:14.458 --> 00:32:16.000
I thought you said I have a year?

00:32:17.041 --> 00:32:18.166
Are you sure?

00:32:19.125 --> 00:32:22.125
Aren't you going to tell her?
Be upfront about your condition.

00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:23.458
I can't.

00:32:26.625 --> 00:32:28.500
She has been an orphan since high school.

00:32:28.583 --> 00:32:30.416
She doesn't have anyone else.

00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:33.291
I'm afraid that
if she found out I was dying,

00:32:35.208 --> 00:32:36.333
she wouldn't be able to cope.

00:32:37.375 --> 00:32:38.708
What if

00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:41.666
something bad happens to you?

00:32:42.916 --> 00:32:43.791
Then what?

00:32:44.416 --> 00:32:45.625
I've thought about that.

00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:50.333
Someone has to take care of her
after I'm gone.

00:32:54.791 --> 00:32:56.000
What happened to you, K?

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.041
I'm fine.

00:32:58.583 --> 00:33:00.666
It's just anemia. Right, doctor?

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.375
Right.

00:33:02.458 --> 00:33:03.500
It's just anemia.

00:33:03.583 --> 00:33:06.875
I'll prescribe him some supplements,

00:33:06.958 --> 00:33:09.166
and if he eats properly, he'll be fine.

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.541
What's the cause of his anemia?

00:33:11.625 --> 00:33:15.041
It could be many things,
but he also seems to lack nutrition.

00:33:15.125 --> 00:33:16.666
Yeah, lacking nutrition.

00:33:17.791 --> 00:33:18.708
That's weird.

00:33:18.791 --> 00:33:21.083
I eat what you eat.

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:22.458
How come I didn't get anemia?

00:33:24.625 --> 00:33:27.291
Because you always eat my portion.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:29.250
Don't trust her.

00:33:29.333 --> 00:33:32.208
She looks thin, but she eats a lot.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.291
-How dare you!
-It hurts!

00:33:34.375 --> 00:33:37.083
-How dare you!
-My head hurts!

00:33:38.708 --> 00:33:42.041
Here, I bought premium meat for you

00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:43.208
so you won't have another anemia episode.

00:33:43.875 --> 00:33:46.416
But too much red meat
can be bad for our health.

00:33:47.416 --> 00:33:48.750
Gosh, you're such a pain.

00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:06.416
What's your biggest wish in life?

00:34:14.208 --> 00:34:16.500
I want you to meet a decent man,

00:34:20.083 --> 00:34:21.250
get married…

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.916
and live happily ever after.

00:34:27.541 --> 00:34:29.000
I don't even have a boyfriend.

00:34:29.083 --> 00:34:30.791
Then look for one.

00:34:32.833 --> 00:34:34.416
Then why don't you marry me?

00:34:37.791 --> 00:34:39.833
I said a decent man.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:42.666
So you're not a decent man?

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.625
I mean, I want your future husband
to be the perfect man.

00:34:51.708 --> 00:34:53.291
What's the criteria?

00:34:55.375 --> 00:34:56.541
He should have a steady job,

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.125
and be rich,
so he could give you everything.

00:35:00.666 --> 00:35:03.125
He also needs to be healthy

00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:07.291
so you both can grow old together.

00:35:08.375 --> 00:35:10.333
Where can I find a guy like that?

00:35:12.166 --> 00:35:13.166
You will find one.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.375
You're pretty, as long as you stop
being so grumpy all the time.

00:35:21.791 --> 00:35:22.958
Here's the meat.

00:35:25.708 --> 00:35:26.666
And your spoon.

00:35:29.208 --> 00:35:30.416
Let's pray first.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.125
What do you think?

00:35:45.958 --> 00:35:47.750
It's a great song, right?

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:53.500
Mr. Aldy.

00:35:54.958 --> 00:35:56.500
It's not that I don't want to help,

00:35:56.583 --> 00:36:02.083
but being a feature singer
on Enlight Radio is not that easy.

00:36:02.708 --> 00:36:04.833
We even had to discuss

00:36:04.916 --> 00:36:07.416
before featuring
Taylor Swift's latest album,

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.083
so you know it's not that simple.

00:36:13.166 --> 00:36:14.708
Well, that's Taylor Swift.

00:36:14.791 --> 00:36:17.416
This is a local singer.
You need to support local talent.

00:36:17.958 --> 00:36:20.333
How can that be? If not…

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.041
My first single is written by Cream.

00:36:25.125 --> 00:36:27.166
Surely you can help put this on the radio?

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.000
Please, K. Help Momo out, will you?

00:36:32.416 --> 00:36:33.291
Okay.

00:36:33.375 --> 00:36:36.708
We might be able
to play this single often,

00:36:36.791 --> 00:36:38.500
but I can't promise

00:36:39.583 --> 00:36:40.833
the whole album for now.

00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:44.750
Yes! That's all right, K.

00:36:44.833 --> 00:36:45.708
Thank you so much!

00:36:45.791 --> 00:36:48.375
The important thing is
to make this single a hit first.

00:36:56.291 --> 00:36:57.750
Momo.

00:36:57.833 --> 00:37:00.000
Are you and Mr. Aldy serious?

00:37:00.708 --> 00:37:01.750
Why all of a sudden?

00:37:02.375 --> 00:37:03.583
I'm just curious.

00:37:04.333 --> 00:37:06.791
Why? Because he's old?

00:37:07.666 --> 00:37:09.125
No! I didn't say that.

00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:10.916
Seriously, I'm just curious.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.250
That's really okay.

00:37:13.375 --> 00:37:15.666
A lot of people say

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.250
Mr. Aldy is old,

00:37:18.083 --> 00:37:20.916
but he's really nice.

00:37:21.666 --> 00:37:25.000
He truly cares about me and loves me.

00:37:26.583 --> 00:37:28.166
He's better than all those young guys.

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:29.916
They're just posers,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.291
cheating every chance they get.

00:37:31.375 --> 00:37:33.208
Plus, they're mokondo.

00:37:33.291 --> 00:37:35.541
Mokondo? What's that?

00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:41.416
Freeloaders.

00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:44.458
You know, right?

00:37:46.541 --> 00:37:49.375
So it's true what they say,
that you need money to be happy.

00:37:49.458 --> 00:37:51.708
Money isn't everything.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.166
But everything needs money.

00:37:59.958 --> 00:38:01.208
K is your boyfriend, right?

00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:03.833
No, we're just roommates.

00:38:04.416 --> 00:38:05.458
Really?

00:38:06.125 --> 00:38:08.916
But I could see that
you guys are very close.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.208
Well, of course.
We've been friends since high school.

00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:15.666
Haven't you guys ever dated each other?

00:38:16.916 --> 00:38:17.791
No.

00:38:18.875 --> 00:38:21.416
I'm actually very comfortable with him,

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.916
but he never said anything.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.666
I can't be the one
making the first move, right?

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:29.458
Nowadays, it's okay for a girl
to make the first move.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.916
But he asked me
to find a man who's steady.

00:38:37.166 --> 00:38:38.041
Who is steady?

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:40.166
I just remembered!

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.083
Come with me
to my high school reunion tonight.

00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:57.708
This is my friend, Cream.

00:38:57.791 --> 00:38:59.041
-Hello, Cream!
-Hi.

00:39:10.125 --> 00:39:11.000
How is it?

00:39:11.541 --> 00:39:12.500
Is there anyone you like?

00:39:22.375 --> 00:39:24.375
Oh, him?

00:39:24.458 --> 00:39:25.875
His name is Armand.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.583
You have a sharp eye.

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:29.833
He's very handsome.

00:39:29.916 --> 00:39:33.416
He's not just good-looking,
but he's also a dentist.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.708
His dad owned a lot of dental clinics
around Jakarta.

00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:37.875
He's perfect for you.

00:39:39.458 --> 00:39:41.333
Come on, go for it.

00:39:51.833 --> 00:39:53.958
Why are you sitting here all alone?

00:39:55.125 --> 00:39:57.208
Yeah. I'm waiting for a friend.

00:39:57.291 --> 00:39:59.291
A friend? Where is she?

00:39:59.375 --> 00:40:01.666
Well, I don't know why she's not here yet.

00:40:06.875 --> 00:40:08.166
What class were you in?

00:40:08.791 --> 00:40:11.708
Oh, I'm not an alumnus.
I came here with Momo.

00:40:13.375 --> 00:40:14.291
Oh, Monica.

00:40:16.916 --> 00:40:18.333
Hey! That's my glass.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:21.166
It's yours?

00:40:21.875 --> 00:40:23.833
That means we indirectly kissed, right?

00:40:26.583 --> 00:40:27.875
You're a dentist, aren't you?

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.041
I've had a tooth problem for a while.
Could you check it out?

00:40:32.791 --> 00:40:34.583
Yeah, sure.

00:40:34.666 --> 00:40:36.625
Well, this is my card.

00:40:36.708 --> 00:40:38.416
That's my clinic's address.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.500
Okay. I'll come by your clinic tomorrow.

00:40:41.583 --> 00:40:43.500
Actually, you need to make
an appointment first!

00:40:51.333 --> 00:40:52.625
I think I found it.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.500
Found what?

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.500
The perfect candidate as you said.

00:41:04.916 --> 00:41:05.958
Who is it?

00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:08.875
He's a dentist.

00:41:19.791 --> 00:41:21.875
I'll tell you more later.

00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:42.791
Please rinse your mouth.

00:41:58.416 --> 00:42:00.000
The scaling is done

00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:02.541
and the cavities are filled.

00:42:02.625 --> 00:42:04.000
Overall, your teeth look good.

00:42:08.041 --> 00:42:09.416
We are moving so fast.

00:42:09.958 --> 00:42:13.000
The first time we met,
we indirectly kissed.

00:42:14.666 --> 00:42:16.125
And now the second time,

00:42:16.208 --> 00:42:18.166
you've already checked
the inside of my mouth.

00:42:21.166 --> 00:42:22.750
Do you have plans tonight?

00:42:24.166 --> 00:42:26.375
Let's get drunk.

00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:36.083
So here's the situation, Cream.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.875
I just want you to know

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:42.500
I'm already engaged.

00:42:42.583 --> 00:42:44.666
And at the reunion,

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.500
I was actually waiting for her.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.708
But she didn't show up.

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:50.208
Engaged, huh?

00:42:51.166 --> 00:42:52.458
Let's see the ring.

00:42:58.125 --> 00:42:59.541
-Cream!
-Let me borrow it.

00:43:19.833 --> 00:43:22.166
I also want an engagement ring.

00:43:24.833 --> 00:43:26.250
In high school,

00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:29.916
my mom, dad and big sister
went to Bandung.

00:43:33.333 --> 00:43:34.666
They had an accident.

00:43:35.958 --> 00:43:37.708
They all died on the spot.

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:41.583
Ever since then, I've had no one.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.041
I just really want

00:43:46.916 --> 00:43:49.750
to be loved by someone…

00:43:52.708 --> 00:43:53.916
Unconditionally.

00:44:05.333 --> 00:44:07.458
I'll accompany you tonight, okay?

00:44:19.708 --> 00:44:23.041
Come on, Mr. K.

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:28.583
Your radio station doesn't play
Momo's song often enough.

00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:30.541
Mr. Aldy,

00:44:31.291 --> 00:44:33.375
that's actually a lot for a newcomer.

00:44:34.166 --> 00:44:35.250
But I'm sorry.

00:44:36.166 --> 00:44:37.708
The traction is not quite good.

00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:40.958
Well,

00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:43.666
play the second single then.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:44.750
Come on.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:53.625
Okay.

00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:55.958
I'll help you

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.500
if you help me too.

00:44:59.666 --> 00:45:00.750
Sure!

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.125
That's what I like.

00:45:05.291 --> 00:45:06.291
Let's do it.

00:45:09.208 --> 00:45:10.125
Tell me.

00:45:10.666 --> 00:45:11.916
Whatever it is,

00:45:12.708 --> 00:45:13.916
I'll do anything to help you.

00:45:15.916 --> 00:45:21.416
Mr. Aldy, could you do
a full background check on someone?

00:45:27.708 --> 00:45:29.750
Why do you think
my song has not gone viral?

00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:34.208
Be patient. Give it some time to catch on.

00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:35.333
Just be patient, Mo.

00:45:38.875 --> 00:45:40.916
By the way,
how are things going with Armand?

00:45:42.083 --> 00:45:43.583
He's already engaged.

00:45:43.666 --> 00:45:44.750
Seriously?

00:45:47.125 --> 00:45:48.791
Yeah, actually…

00:45:48.875 --> 00:45:50.208
You're in love with K, right?

00:45:54.791 --> 00:45:57.250
Why don't you just be frank with him?

00:45:57.333 --> 00:46:00.583
If he likes me, then why did he tell me
to go find a husband?

00:46:01.916 --> 00:46:03.125
Well, that's true.

00:46:03.208 --> 00:46:06.791
Or is it fine, as long as he's happy?

00:46:07.666 --> 00:46:09.583
Well, that's not really
the concept of love.

00:46:10.625 --> 00:46:12.041
That's not logical.

00:46:12.666 --> 00:46:14.416
If love were logical,

00:46:15.875 --> 00:46:18.250
then no one would suffer from it.

00:46:22.583 --> 00:46:24.250
That would be a great lyric for a song!

00:46:24.875 --> 00:46:26.250
Write it down.

00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:35.333
Hi, Chester!

00:46:35.416 --> 00:46:36.708
Taking Snoopy for a walk?

00:46:36.791 --> 00:46:39.000
Yeah, going on a date.

00:46:39.791 --> 00:46:43.375
By the way,
how are things going with the dentist?

00:46:44.083 --> 00:46:45.916
Well, we still hang out.

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:53.291
Do you really like him?

00:46:53.375 --> 00:46:55.875
Aren't you the one who told me
to go find someone like him?

00:46:57.083 --> 00:46:59.666
He fits all your criteria, right?

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.958
Okay. Well, I'll go take a walk.

00:47:09.041 --> 00:47:11.208
Let's go.

00:47:13.833 --> 00:47:14.875
All done.

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:27.333
What did I say?

00:47:28.166 --> 00:47:30.250
There is nothing that I couldn't do.

00:47:31.708 --> 00:47:33.750
Armand Suryadi is a good man.

00:47:33.833 --> 00:47:35.041
He has no criminal record.

00:47:35.666 --> 00:47:38.500
His dad, Charles Suryadi,

00:47:38.583 --> 00:47:40.750
is a rich man.

00:47:40.833 --> 00:47:43.875
He has over ten dental clinics
in Jakarta alone.

00:47:44.666 --> 00:47:46.166
That's his fiancée,

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:47.750
Vero Solaya.

00:47:47.833 --> 00:47:50.000
An up-and-coming photographer in Jakarta.

00:47:50.083 --> 00:47:52.250
Wait, so he's engaged?

00:47:53.625 --> 00:47:54.708
Calm down.

00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:59.166
Without you asking, I also did
a background check on her.

00:48:00.041 --> 00:48:02.333
She's a total player.

00:48:03.208 --> 00:48:05.666
On Monday, she's with one guy.

00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:09.208
On Wednesday, she's with an older man.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:11.750
Yes, an older man.

00:48:15.625 --> 00:48:17.833
Well, it's Vero.

00:48:18.666 --> 00:48:21.166
And Armand is unaware of this?

00:48:21.916 --> 00:48:23.583
I told you.

00:48:23.666 --> 00:48:26.166
Armand is a genuinely nice guy

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.458
and Vero's just playing him.

00:48:29.791 --> 00:48:31.500
These photos are for me, right?

00:48:31.583 --> 00:48:33.041
Of course!

00:48:33.125 --> 00:48:34.833
Why would I keep photos like that?

00:48:35.708 --> 00:48:37.458
So, it's a deal, right?

00:48:38.958 --> 00:48:40.750
Momo's second single
will be played, right?

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.833
All right.

00:48:43.875 --> 00:48:45.041
Deal!

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:57.666
Armand.

00:48:58.416 --> 00:49:00.291
Where's the P&L report for this quarter?

00:49:00.916 --> 00:49:02.041
It's not done yet, Dad.

00:49:02.125 --> 00:49:03.250
You should step up!

00:49:03.333 --> 00:49:07.083
You're the managing director here.
What do you even do?

00:49:08.041 --> 00:49:09.666
Stop wasting time with women!

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:10.666
I don't care.

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:12.833
I want the report done today!

00:49:19.708 --> 00:49:20.583
Doctor!

00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:22.708
Sorry.

00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:25.375
But someone came
and asked to give this to Dr. Armand.

00:49:26.416 --> 00:49:28.541
-From who?
-He didn't say his name.

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:30.041
Excuse me.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.291
Do you take me for an idiot?

00:49:38.833 --> 00:49:40.375
I've already told you.

00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:42.916
I need freedom in my profession.

00:49:43.791 --> 00:49:44.625
Do you think it's easy

00:49:44.708 --> 00:49:47.083
for a young photographer like me
to do a solo exhibition?

00:49:47.166 --> 00:49:49.208
I told you I would finance it,
but you refused.

00:49:49.291 --> 00:49:51.458
What's so great about having an exhibition
funded by your own boyfriend?

00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:53.666
-So you asked that old man to finance you?
-Hey!

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:57.500
He's a filmmaker and I love his work!
Show some respect!

00:49:58.291 --> 00:49:59.625
Don't you have a brain?

00:50:05.083 --> 00:50:06.458
Don't you have a heart?

00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:09.791
Don't you know

00:50:10.791 --> 00:50:12.916
that I am not happy?

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.541
You don't even know that
our relationship has problems.

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:21.250
And that's the problem.

00:51:19.625 --> 00:51:20.916
Okay, all good.

00:51:24.291 --> 00:51:25.458
Hey! What is all this?

00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:27.250
Stop!

00:51:27.333 --> 00:51:29.291
Who are you? You got the wrong person!

00:51:31.833 --> 00:51:33.000
You sent this, right? Bastard!

00:51:33.583 --> 00:51:35.166
Who are you to try and ruin my life?

00:51:38.166 --> 00:51:39.291
Vero!

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:41.625
Who the hell are you? Bastard!

00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:45.291
I'm sorry, I can explain all this.

00:51:45.375 --> 00:51:46.125
No need!

00:51:46.875 --> 00:51:47.875
You are crazy.

00:51:50.458 --> 00:51:51.333
Vero!

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.666
Are you okay, K?

00:52:01.416 --> 00:52:03.291
Are you sure this is a good idea, K?

00:52:03.916 --> 00:52:04.791
It is my fault, Yan.

00:52:05.458 --> 00:52:07.166
But do you want to go see her again?

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:08.541
I need to apologize.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.416
Vero.

00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:19.875
-What else do you want, bastard?
-Calm down.

00:52:19.958 --> 00:52:21.541
Please don't hit us again, miss.

00:52:22.916 --> 00:52:26.333
I'm here to apologize to you,

00:52:26.416 --> 00:52:29.458
since you said yesterday
that I seem to have ruined your life.

00:52:29.541 --> 00:52:31.958
Who are you exactly? What do you want?

00:52:32.583 --> 00:52:33.625
Well, I'm Kawidra.

00:52:34.208 --> 00:52:36.083
And I need your help.

00:52:37.125 --> 00:52:38.208
Oh, God.

00:52:38.875 --> 00:52:40.750
So I have a best friend

00:52:41.375 --> 00:52:42.750
and her name is Cream.

00:52:43.708 --> 00:52:45.708
Unfortunately, she has her eyes
on Armand, your fiancé.

00:52:46.708 --> 00:52:48.041
At first, I wanted her to back off,

00:52:48.125 --> 00:52:50.125
but after seeing those photos,

00:52:50.208 --> 00:52:52.083
I thought maybe
you don't love him as much.

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:54.375
So please,

00:52:55.458 --> 00:52:56.708
let them be together.

00:52:56.791 --> 00:52:58.291
Who are you to tell me what to do?

00:52:58.375 --> 00:53:00.166
-Not like that.
-Hey!

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:02.458
Armand is my boyfriend since high school.

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:08.166
Why do I have to give him up
for your girlfriend?

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.625
I'm dying, Vero.

00:53:12.416 --> 00:53:13.750
Wait, what do you mean?

00:53:14.625 --> 00:53:16.916
I have less than a year to live.

00:53:24.541 --> 00:53:27.666
I have pancreatic cancer, Stage IV.

00:53:29.375 --> 00:53:31.458
This is the diagnosis.

00:53:45.041 --> 00:53:47.125
So, before I die,

00:53:47.208 --> 00:53:49.416
I want Cream to marry a decent man.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.250
If there is another choice, believe me,

00:53:52.333 --> 00:53:54.083
I won't do this.

00:53:54.166 --> 00:53:55.333
Okay.

00:53:55.416 --> 00:53:58.791
Now, if I say yes, what's in it for me?

00:53:58.875 --> 00:54:01.458
It's only good for you.
I don't care about your condition.

00:54:01.541 --> 00:54:03.500
Wait a minute.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.958
This is my savings
for the last couple of years.

00:54:09.041 --> 00:54:11.250
At first, I wanted
to give this all to Cream.

00:54:11.333 --> 00:54:14.375
But after I learned that Armand could
support her more than enough,

00:54:14.458 --> 00:54:15.625
I thought this might be
more useful for you.

00:54:24.125 --> 00:54:25.583
It's not much.

00:54:26.291 --> 00:54:28.166
But that's all I have.

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.333
Okay.

00:54:33.416 --> 00:54:34.875
Thank you!

00:54:34.958 --> 00:54:36.291
On one condition.

00:54:36.375 --> 00:54:37.375
What's that?

00:54:37.458 --> 00:54:39.958
I want you to be the subject
of my next photo exhibit.

00:54:40.583 --> 00:54:41.458
Why me?

00:54:41.541 --> 00:54:44.333
The theme is death and destruction.

00:54:46.375 --> 00:54:48.500
I wanted to take photos and interview
people on the brink of death,

00:54:48.583 --> 00:54:50.000
like you.

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.750
-Hey, that's not right!
-That's okay.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.875
Anything for Cream.

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:07.333
How could you not tell me this?

00:55:09.458 --> 00:55:13.041
Well, I didn't want you
to worry like this.

00:55:13.125 --> 00:55:14.250
What do you mean, K?

00:55:16.583 --> 00:55:17.750
Am I not your friend?

00:55:18.625 --> 00:55:19.833
You're my best friend.

00:55:24.875 --> 00:55:26.833
Why don't you just come clean with Cream?

00:55:29.666 --> 00:55:31.958
Are you sure this is what she wants?

00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:34.500
I want someone to take care of her

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:36.916
after I'm gone, Yan.

00:55:38.583 --> 00:55:40.750
You love her that much.

00:55:44.833 --> 00:55:46.125
Does she know

00:55:46.208 --> 00:55:47.625
how you feel?

00:55:49.333 --> 00:55:50.833
She doesn't need to know.

00:55:55.041 --> 00:55:56.625
The important thing is, I know.

00:56:10.833 --> 00:56:13.875
Thank you for bringing some food
at this late hour.

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:16.500
Well, you mentioned

00:56:17.208 --> 00:56:18.958
you always come home late

00:56:19.041 --> 00:56:20.791
and you live alone.

00:56:22.208 --> 00:56:24.916
Who will prepare your dinner then?

00:56:27.416 --> 00:56:28.875
In my whole life,

00:56:29.875 --> 00:56:32.416
no one has ever cared about me like this.

00:56:33.416 --> 00:56:34.708
I'm different, you know.

00:56:36.625 --> 00:56:37.833
That's true.

00:56:46.875 --> 00:56:48.041
Let's break this off.

00:56:48.708 --> 00:56:51.541
We don't need to think
about a wedding anymore.

00:56:54.458 --> 00:56:55.666
Because of the photos?

00:56:58.583 --> 00:56:59.958
I've realized that

00:57:00.041 --> 00:57:02.041
we've been together since high school,

00:57:02.666 --> 00:57:04.458
but a lot has changed.

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:08.625
I was selfish.

00:57:09.291 --> 00:57:12.000
I even forced you into marriage.

00:57:13.625 --> 00:57:15.166
I've also just realized that

00:57:17.083 --> 00:57:18.375
the truth is…

00:57:20.541 --> 00:57:22.291
I need to be loved.

00:57:26.083 --> 00:57:27.916
After meeting someone

00:57:29.875 --> 00:57:32.708
who always shares
what's on her mind with me,

00:57:36.125 --> 00:57:38.416
for the first time in my life,

00:57:39.875 --> 00:57:41.791
I feel like
someone actually cares about me.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:51.916
It's good then.

00:57:52.708 --> 00:57:54.958
You've found the love of your life.

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:00.791
I didn't really want to marry you.

00:58:31.125 --> 00:58:32.833
For being with me all this time.

00:59:15.541 --> 00:59:17.875
Do you often volunteer here?

00:59:17.958 --> 00:59:19.666
Yeah, since high school.

00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:23.083
If you like dogs so much,
why don't you just get one

00:59:23.166 --> 00:59:24.791
instead of volunteering here?

00:59:24.875 --> 00:59:28.041
Pets are not allowed in my apartment.

00:59:28.125 --> 00:59:32.500
A shelter like this always needs
volunteers and financial support.

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.750
Do you want to donate?

00:59:35.375 --> 00:59:36.666
Yeah, well.

00:59:37.208 --> 00:59:40.291
The movie we saw was great.
Why did you suddenly take me to a movie?

00:59:40.375 --> 00:59:42.083
Yeah, I wanted to see you.

00:59:42.708 --> 00:59:44.166
You miss me that much, huh?

00:59:48.458 --> 00:59:49.875
I ended things with Vero.

00:59:51.833 --> 00:59:53.333
Because I realized that

00:59:53.958 --> 00:59:55.458
I love you.

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:06.708
Would you be my girlfriend?

01:00:28.666 --> 01:00:30.583
I'm officially dating Armand.

01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:44.583
Hello? Yes?

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:50.791
My battery is running low.
I'll call you back.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.125
K, can I borrow yours?

01:00:56.208 --> 01:00:58.000
Hey, don't you understand privacy?

01:01:03.416 --> 01:01:05.250
I'm waiting for a call.

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:08.166
I'm only borrowing it for a while.

01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:18.666
I'm heading there now.

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:27.458
Who was it?

01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:31.500
I'll be home late.

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:34.500
You don't need to wait for me.

01:01:36.041 --> 01:01:37.166
I'll bring my keys.

01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:48.125
I couldn't believe
there's someone as stupid as you.

01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:51.541
Why?

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.041
You don't like what I said?

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:54.166
You are an idiot!

01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:59.375
If you like Cream,

01:02:00.166 --> 01:02:01.666
why don't you just tell her
that you love her?

01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:03.583
Just say, "Hey, I love you."

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:07.250
Yet here you are, troubling yourself
to find a guy to marry her.

01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:10.750
People say love is complicated,

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.541
but it's really not.

01:02:13.375 --> 01:02:15.208
Only idiots like you make it complicated.

01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:16.833
-I'm not an idiot.
-Yes, you're an idiot!

01:02:16.916 --> 01:02:17.875
Why not just say to her?

01:02:17.958 --> 01:02:19.708
-It's not that easy!
-Why not?

01:02:19.791 --> 01:02:21.750
All you have to do is say what you feel.
What's so hard about that?

01:02:21.833 --> 01:02:24.125
-I can't.
-Why not?

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:25.750
Because I'm dying.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.916
Why would I tell her?

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.333
To make myself feel at ease?

01:02:44.666 --> 01:02:46.166
Love isn't selfish.

01:02:49.458 --> 01:02:50.708
True love

01:02:51.958 --> 01:02:53.708
doesn't think only of itself.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:59.833
She taught me that.

01:03:02.666 --> 01:03:04.791
When I'm all alone,

01:03:06.125 --> 01:03:07.833
Cream is always there.

01:03:12.083 --> 01:03:15.333
When I feel down,
she always believes in me.

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:21.208
My dream has always been
to live a happy life with Cream.

01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:24.750
To marry her,

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:26.833
to grow old with her.

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:32.458
But in reality…

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.291
I have to wake up from that dream

01:03:39.708 --> 01:03:42.000
and do what's best for her.

01:03:59.666 --> 01:04:01.875
I'M SORRY FOR BEING RUDE EARLIER
BY GRABBING YOUR PHONE

01:04:04.791 --> 01:04:10.041
BUT I'M ALSO MAD AT YOU.
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO OVERLY DRAMATIC?

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.375
SORRY FOR BEING MAD EARLIER, CREAM.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.458
WHY AREN'T YOU ASLEEP AT THIS HOUR?

01:04:27.666 --> 01:04:31.125
WAITING FOR YOU

01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:37.208
I'M HUNGRY…

01:04:40.666 --> 01:04:43.166
I TOLD YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT UP.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:47.333
COME OUT. I'LL MAKE YOU SOME SPAGHETTI.

01:05:07.791 --> 01:05:13.791
THANKS FOR THE SPAGHETTI

01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:25.333
YOU'RE WELCOME.
SORRY I YELLED AT YOU EARLIER.

01:05:25.416 --> 01:05:29.500
ARE YOU STILL UPSET?

01:05:30.166 --> 01:05:34.000
YES. WHAT IS WITH YOU LATELY?

01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:51.041
I'M FINE, JUST A BIT TIRED. THAT'S ALL.

01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:53.250
AGAIN, I'M SORRY.
STOP BEING UPSET, PLEASE?

01:06:12.916 --> 01:06:16.041
-For next time…
-We can do that.

01:06:16.125 --> 01:06:17.791
Sorry, we're late.

01:06:17.875 --> 01:06:19.125
Let me introduce to you, this is Armand.

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.916
-Hello, everyone!
-Hello.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.583
Armand, this is K.

01:06:23.791 --> 01:06:26.916
-We finally meet, K.
-Yeah.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.416
Cream talks about you all the time.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.416
Well, Cream also talks about you
all the time.

01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:33.208
Thank you, K,

01:06:33.916 --> 01:06:36.250
for taking such good care
of Cream all this time.

01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:39.958
We all know she doesn't have anyone else.

01:06:41.166 --> 01:06:42.708
That's why she has you now, right?

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:47.041
Please take good care of her
and make her happy.

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:48.458
Yeah, sure.

01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:50.166
I promise.

01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:58.958
Hello. Hi, Monica. How are you?

01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:01.208
-Aldy.
-Armand.

01:07:01.291 --> 01:07:02.375
-Hello. Sekar.
-Armand.

01:07:02.458 --> 01:07:03.708
-Yandy.
-Armand.

01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:06.041
Sorry, everyone, for being late.

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:08.625
Well, the usual. Jakarta's traffic is bad.

01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:12.708
That's okay,
we just ordered drinks as well.

01:07:14.125 --> 01:07:17.250
Aldy, I used to go to school with Armand.

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:18.208
Really?

01:07:18.291 --> 01:07:20.500
I heard you are a singer now?

01:07:20.583 --> 01:07:24.000
Yes, I just released my latest single
and the one who wrote the lyrics is Cream.

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:26.833
-Really?
-You don't know, right?

01:07:26.916 --> 01:07:29.250
You haven't heard the song yet?
I'll let you listen to it later.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.083
Sorry, I think there's something
I need to do at the office.

01:07:34.166 --> 01:07:36.000
-K, let me drive you.
-No need.

01:07:36.958 --> 01:07:40.375
Hey, that's not cool, man!

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:42.416
We're having fun.

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.416
Next time, you guys go ahead.

01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:47.500
Don't think about me.

01:07:48.125 --> 01:07:50.916
Everyone, Armand, Cream. I'm leaving.

01:07:54.541 --> 01:07:55.458
Okay then.

01:07:56.041 --> 01:07:57.250
Let's just eat.

01:07:57.333 --> 01:07:58.541
I will order.

01:08:44.333 --> 01:08:45.541
Are you okay?

01:08:46.875 --> 01:08:48.541
I'm fine.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.375
I'm just feeling under the weather.

01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:54.125
I'm not going to the office today.

01:08:54.916 --> 01:08:56.583
I'll see Dr. Joko later.

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:58.500
Do you want me to accompany you?

01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:00.416
No need.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.208
I don't want to bother you.

01:09:18.458 --> 01:09:19.750
What's the matter, Cream?

01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:38.375
Do you love me?

01:09:39.666 --> 01:09:40.875
Very much.

01:09:40.958 --> 01:09:43.750
You were supposed to marry Vero
in three months, right?

01:09:43.833 --> 01:09:45.000
Before it got canceled.

01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:49.250
You had everything
prepared anyway, didn't you?

01:09:53.833 --> 01:09:55.083
Let's just get married.

01:10:05.833 --> 01:10:08.041
I have never met anyone like you, Cream.

01:10:32.958 --> 01:10:34.708
Time flies.

01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:36.541
Next month, in October,

01:10:37.791 --> 01:10:39.041
you two are getting married.

01:10:47.958 --> 01:10:50.083
I know you are very close with Cream.

01:10:50.166 --> 01:10:52.041
You're practically family.

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:56.000
But may I request that
after we get married,

01:10:57.458 --> 01:11:00.250
could you see a little less of her?

01:11:01.333 --> 01:11:02.916
It's just that, well…

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.583
I need more time alone with her.

01:11:05.666 --> 01:11:07.708
To get to know her better.

01:11:08.875 --> 01:11:09.916
Don't worry.

01:11:11.416 --> 01:11:12.708
I know my place.

01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:16.375
I'm happy to see you guys happy.

01:11:17.125 --> 01:11:19.708
-I'm sorry, it's just…
-It's okay.

01:11:21.291 --> 01:11:22.333
I understand.

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:27.625
Another thing.

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:31.791
Cream said that she wants to pick
her wedding gown with you, K.

01:11:32.458 --> 01:11:33.333
Is that okay with you?

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:35.458
I already agreed to it.

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:39.333
Besides, they say it's bad luck
for the groom to see the wedding gown

01:11:39.416 --> 01:11:40.416
before the wedding.

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:42.375
Could you help her?

01:11:48.625 --> 01:11:50.208
Here's the coffee.

01:11:50.291 --> 01:11:52.000
The coffee smells really good.

01:11:52.083 --> 01:11:53.125
Really?

01:11:54.541 --> 01:11:55.791
Really good.

01:11:55.875 --> 01:11:57.541
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:07.083
How is it?

01:12:07.916 --> 01:12:09.041
Isn't it beautiful?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.625
Which one is better?

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.000
I don't know. It's hard to choose.

01:12:22.125 --> 01:12:23.083
You look beautiful in anything.

01:12:24.416 --> 01:12:25.375
What do you think, ma'am?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.125
Well, it's tough.

01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:31.041
It needs to match the groom's suit.

01:12:31.666 --> 01:12:35.208
Why don't you try on the suit, sir?

01:12:35.291 --> 01:12:37.125
So we can see if they match
when paired together.

01:12:37.208 --> 01:12:39.875
Sorry, but I'm not the groom.

01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:42.208
That's okay, K. Just try it on.

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:43.708
Just for comparison.

01:12:45.125 --> 01:12:48.916
You're here to help me find
the best wedding gown, aren't you?

01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:51.416
Okay.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.583
Wow, you look very handsome!

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:02.708
I think this is good enough,
I'll just get changed now.

01:13:02.791 --> 01:13:04.500
Wait a minute!

01:13:05.541 --> 01:13:06.708
Let's take a picture.

01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:08.250
Come here.

01:13:10.291 --> 01:13:12.291
Ma'am, could you please take
a picture of us?

01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:13.958
-Sure.
-Just click this button.

01:13:14.833 --> 01:13:15.875
Okay.

01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:18.916
Let me take a look first.

01:13:24.708 --> 01:13:26.000
Handsome.

01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:28.125
Yes, you are.

01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:32.541
One, two, three.

01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:38.625
Thank you, ma'am.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.041
Do you want to try on another?

01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:43.000
Sure.

01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:45.458
-K, you wait here first.
-Yeah.

01:13:46.083 --> 01:13:47.333
I'll get changed.

01:15:01.416 --> 01:15:03.208
K, let's take another picture!

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.208
Where did you go?

01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:14.250
Why did you leave me alone?

01:17:14.875 --> 01:17:18.500
There was an announcer
who suddenly couldn't go on air,

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:20.791
so I had to fill in.

01:17:24.875 --> 01:17:25.875
Here, eat first.

01:17:25.958 --> 01:17:27.625
I made some noodles for you.

01:17:28.458 --> 01:17:30.708
But it's probably not as tasty
as the ones you usually make.

01:17:46.666 --> 01:17:48.333
Your future husband is a lucky man.

01:17:58.916 --> 01:18:00.375
Can you help me

01:18:00.458 --> 01:18:02.333
rehearse the wedding ceremony?

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:04.625
What for?

01:18:04.708 --> 01:18:06.708
I'm nervous, you know.

01:18:06.791 --> 01:18:08.958
You only have to say "I do."

01:18:09.041 --> 01:18:10.958
How about the ring exchange part?

01:18:11.041 --> 01:18:12.875
You just need to exchange them.

01:18:12.958 --> 01:18:13.833
It's easy.

01:18:13.916 --> 01:18:16.958
I don't care. I want to practice.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.375
Okay.

01:18:21.625 --> 01:18:23.458
Clarissa…

01:18:23.541 --> 01:18:24.416
Wait a minute.

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:39.375
Clarissa.

01:18:41.375 --> 01:18:46.000
Do you take this man
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:49.916
to love and cherish,

01:18:50.666 --> 01:18:52.500
in sickness and in health,

01:18:53.958 --> 01:18:55.791
until death do you part?

01:18:57.875 --> 01:18:59.500
I do.

01:19:16.041 --> 01:19:17.666
In the name of Jesus Christ,

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:21.000
I pronounce you husband and wife.

01:19:23.083 --> 01:19:25.375
Is that the usual closing statement
from a priest at a wedding ceremony?

01:20:00.833 --> 01:20:03.750
Okay, that's enough for now.

01:20:10.208 --> 01:20:11.375
Let's take a picture!

01:21:41.541 --> 01:21:43.291
After K passed away,

01:21:44.208 --> 01:21:47.000
we found Cream's diary in her room.

01:21:47.958 --> 01:21:49.625
So? What happens next?

01:22:36.833 --> 01:22:38.583
I already know

01:22:39.666 --> 01:22:40.791
from the beginning.

01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:43.208
Wid!

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:44.458
Wait a minute, Wid.

01:22:45.916 --> 01:22:47.916
-Wid.
-I don't really understand.

01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:52.791
You said my mom was fine.

01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:57.583
To be honest, Wid,

01:22:58.750 --> 01:23:02.166
your mom's hepatitis is actually curable.

01:23:03.166 --> 01:23:05.625
But what I didn't take
into consideration is that

01:23:05.708 --> 01:23:08.875
she didn't will her body
to fight the illness.

01:23:09.666 --> 01:23:13.041
It's as though she wanted to die,

01:23:13.125 --> 01:23:14.833
just so she could be with your dad.

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:17.583
So, my mom…

01:23:21.916 --> 01:23:23.541
chose to leave rather than be with me?

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:26.791
You can't say that, Wid.

01:23:27.625 --> 01:23:29.625
Maybe your mom

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:32.291
couldn't control her emotions.

01:23:34.083 --> 01:23:35.458
I never thought

01:23:36.208 --> 01:23:40.125
a person could die from sadness.

01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:46.458
The power of love is truly unbelievable.

01:23:49.666 --> 01:23:51.375
You are now alone.

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:55.250
You need to take good care of yourself.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.583
You have cancer in your genes.

01:24:00.916 --> 01:24:03.041
You need to have regular checkups with me.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:07.958
Ever since that day,

01:24:08.041 --> 01:24:11.625
I knew we were destined to be together.

01:24:13.791 --> 01:24:16.375
We became orphans at the same time.

01:24:17.583 --> 01:24:19.833
I didn't know which was more painful.

01:24:20.583 --> 01:24:24.166
Losing my family in a sudden accident,

01:24:25.166 --> 01:24:26.458
or K,

01:24:27.625 --> 01:24:29.958
who had to watch his dad fight
a long battle with cancer,

01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:32.541
then lose his mom

01:24:32.625 --> 01:24:34.208
to illness just a month later.

01:24:35.416 --> 01:24:38.416
I was sure I'd live with K forever.

01:24:40.083 --> 01:24:42.291
He never said he loved me.

01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:46.958
But sometimes,
love doesn't need to be spoken.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.500
It needs to be felt.

01:24:58.333 --> 01:25:01.000
A rookie dared to criticize my lyrics!

01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:06.375
I don't know Gen Z's taste?

01:25:08.041 --> 01:25:10.291
I'll write the most Gen Z lyrics.

01:25:25.333 --> 01:25:29.041
K, I'm borrowing your comic books
for inspiration.

01:25:43.416 --> 01:25:44.875
Until the day

01:25:46.166 --> 01:25:48.208
that changed everything.

01:25:48.291 --> 01:25:51.166
These are cancer medications
and painkillers.

01:25:52.375 --> 01:25:54.666
People on this combination of medications

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:56.708
are usually in the last stage of cancer.

01:25:56.791 --> 01:25:58.458
They can't be helped
by chemotherapy anymore.

01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:30.208
Don't leave me!

01:26:33.916 --> 01:26:38.333
Don't leave me alone!

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:02.916
I didn't know what to do.

01:27:03.625 --> 01:27:05.541
K was secretly hiding his illness.

01:27:06.375 --> 01:27:08.041
He must've had his reasons.

01:27:10.166 --> 01:27:14.666
You're going to experience
blackouts like this more frequently.

01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:17.916
You need to be more careful.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.708
Don't forget to take your medication.

01:27:20.250 --> 01:27:21.125
But…

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.916
I thought you said I have a year?

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.166
Are you sure?

01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:28.083
Aren't you going to tell her?
Be upfront about your condition.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.083
I can't.

01:27:30.708 --> 01:27:32.791
She has been an orphan since high school.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.833
She doesn't have anyone else.

01:27:35.916 --> 01:27:37.625
What if

01:27:38.541 --> 01:27:40.916
something bad happens to you?

01:27:41.666 --> 01:27:42.500
Then what?

01:27:43.166 --> 01:27:44.375
I've thought about that.

01:27:45.416 --> 01:27:47.458
Someone has to take care of her
after I'm gone.

01:27:50.125 --> 01:27:51.250
Turns out,

01:27:51.875 --> 01:27:55.250
that was the reason
K kept his illness a secret from me.

01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:00.000
What happened to you, K?

01:28:00.666 --> 01:28:03.833
I'm fine. It's just anemia.

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.541
That night, I tried
to make him open up to me.

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:10.416
Then, maybe

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.250
we could be together
before he passed away.

01:28:14.291 --> 01:28:16.875
What's your biggest wish in life?

01:28:17.416 --> 01:28:20.416
I want you to meet a decent man,

01:28:23.625 --> 01:28:24.541
get married…

01:28:25.625 --> 01:28:27.375
and live happily ever after.

01:28:28.291 --> 01:28:30.541
It turned out that was part of his plan.

01:28:30.625 --> 01:28:34.291
In his last days,
he wanted someone to take care of me.

01:28:35.541 --> 01:28:36.708
I think I found it.

01:28:38.375 --> 01:28:40.750
The perfect candidate as you said.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:44.958
Cancer can spread more rapidly
when someone is under stress.

01:28:45.666 --> 01:28:49.041
That's why I went along with his plans
so he could feel at ease.

01:28:50.583 --> 01:28:51.583
Who is it?

01:28:52.583 --> 01:28:54.458
He's a dentist.

01:28:55.333 --> 01:28:56.750
And I had hoped that

01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:59.958
his cancer would not get any worse.

01:29:02.625 --> 01:29:05.416
At first, I wanted to make K jealous,

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.375
but the truth is

01:29:09.416 --> 01:29:10.958
his mind is set.

01:29:13.666 --> 01:29:16.875
That night, I only thought about K.

01:29:18.708 --> 01:29:21.458
I was so sad,
thinking why can't I be with him?

01:29:23.375 --> 01:29:25.416
How could fate be so cruel?

01:29:26.541 --> 01:29:29.791
Why does everyone I love
have to leave me behind?

01:29:31.416 --> 01:29:34.000
Armand, it seems like
I have to go now too.

01:29:34.083 --> 01:29:37.041
I just remembered
I have some work to finish tonight

01:29:37.125 --> 01:29:38.166
for tomorrow's recording.

01:29:39.166 --> 01:29:40.333
Can't you do it later?

01:29:40.416 --> 01:29:41.750
I'm afraid I won't finish it in time.

01:29:41.833 --> 01:29:43.666
It's okay, you can stay
and keep them company here.

01:29:44.666 --> 01:29:46.708
Everyone, I have to go now.

01:29:57.625 --> 01:30:00.333
That night, I was so worried
about K's condition.

01:30:01.416 --> 01:30:03.416
That night, I made up my mind.

01:30:03.958 --> 01:30:06.208
If K ever turned around,

01:30:06.291 --> 01:30:08.166
and saw me standing there,

01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:11.375
I would run to him and hug him.

01:30:11.958 --> 01:30:15.083
Then I would tell him everything

01:30:15.166 --> 01:30:17.625
and he doesn't need
to worry about me anymore.

01:30:28.041 --> 01:30:29.750
But that night,

01:30:29.833 --> 01:30:32.875
he never turned around.

01:30:41.166 --> 01:30:44.375
I knew he didn't have much time.

01:30:57.041 --> 01:30:59.916
I had to fulfill his wish
as quickly as I could.

01:31:10.791 --> 01:31:11.875
Let's get married.

01:31:24.833 --> 01:31:26.375
Do you want to try on another?

01:31:27.916 --> 01:31:28.791
Sure.

01:31:29.625 --> 01:31:30.750
K, you wait here first.

01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:32.833
I'll get changed.

01:32:07.625 --> 01:32:09.416
We were truly married

01:32:10.333 --> 01:32:12.916
in front of God and the universe.

01:32:13.875 --> 01:32:15.708
No one needs to know.

01:32:15.791 --> 01:32:17.708
Only we do.

01:32:23.458 --> 01:32:26.541
I truly wished K would kiss me,

01:32:28.041 --> 01:32:29.291
but I knew

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.375
he wasn't that kind of man.

01:32:32.916 --> 01:32:35.708
That's enough for now.

01:32:41.666 --> 01:32:44.833
And this is our wedding picture.

01:32:46.875 --> 01:32:47.791
That day,

01:32:48.708 --> 01:32:51.541
I was hoping K would be the one
waiting at the altar,

01:32:56.125 --> 01:33:00.583
not the one walking me down
the aisle to marry another man.

01:33:15.708 --> 01:33:17.708
You don't have to worry, K.

01:33:21.416 --> 01:33:23.625
From the beginning,
it's always been just the two of us.

01:33:25.208 --> 01:33:26.208
Now…

01:33:28.666 --> 01:33:29.916
and forever.

01:33:34.541 --> 01:33:36.000
And forever.

01:33:38.625 --> 01:33:40.000
I'm scared.

01:33:42.708 --> 01:33:44.375
I'm scared, Cream.

01:33:48.166 --> 01:33:49.958
I don't want to leave you.

01:33:53.083 --> 01:33:55.041
I don't want to die.

01:33:57.541 --> 01:33:59.458
I really don't want to die.

01:34:16.791 --> 01:34:18.916
Now, we can stay together here.

01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:24.666
No more secrets.

01:34:34.208 --> 01:34:36.041
And we were already married.

01:34:52.666 --> 01:34:53.791
Forever.

01:34:56.375 --> 01:34:57.875
Forever.

01:35:00.875 --> 01:35:02.125
Clarissa.

01:35:09.041 --> 01:35:10.166
Thank you.

01:35:16.875 --> 01:35:18.041
Thank you.

01:36:07.875 --> 01:36:09.291
Thank you.

01:36:20.291 --> 01:36:22.916
Thank you for everything, K.

01:36:35.291 --> 01:36:36.500
Oh, God.

01:36:40.375 --> 01:36:44.458
I want to record their song, may I?

01:36:46.541 --> 01:36:47.791
Absolutely.

01:36:48.791 --> 01:36:51.875
They'll be proud to have their song
sung by you, Ms. Ocha.

01:36:54.916 --> 01:36:56.375
But what about

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.958
the fees, rights, and royalties?

01:37:01.041 --> 01:37:02.541
How about all that?

01:37:03.333 --> 01:37:04.958
Just donate it.

01:37:05.041 --> 01:37:09.208
K and Cream have always volunteered
at an animal shelter nearby.

01:37:10.375 --> 01:37:13.875
I'm sure they'd be happy

01:37:13.958 --> 01:37:19.083
to have the earnings
from their song go toward supporting it.

01:37:23.333 --> 01:37:24.625
Okay.

01:37:25.291 --> 01:37:26.541
Thank you, Ms. Ocha.

01:37:31.458 --> 01:37:36.458
This song is for you

01:37:38.041 --> 01:37:43.958
And for the deceived heart

01:37:45.250 --> 01:37:49.416
You said that the world

01:37:52.125 --> 01:37:56.583
Is fine

01:37:58.666 --> 01:38:03.333
And so I am fine too

01:38:03.416 --> 01:38:07.583
I just wish this hurt

01:38:07.666 --> 01:38:11.708
Will subside

01:38:12.375 --> 01:38:17.291
As I slowly forget

01:38:17.375 --> 01:38:23.416
Your voice

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:27.875
When I was

01:38:29.458 --> 01:38:34.458
Fine

01:38:39.833 --> 01:38:45.041
This song is about you

01:39:21.625 --> 01:39:24.250
I once told K that he is an idiot.

01:39:26.625 --> 01:39:29.375
Love shouldn't be that complicated.

01:39:31.166 --> 01:39:33.291
He should've just told Cream
how he really felt.

01:39:37.583 --> 01:39:39.041
But it turns out I was the idiot.

01:39:41.208 --> 01:39:43.166
I didn't understand the meaning of love.

01:39:44.875 --> 01:39:46.708
Love needs sacrifice.

01:39:49.583 --> 01:39:51.083
The truth is,

01:39:51.166 --> 01:39:53.541
the biggest happiness for K is

01:39:54.708 --> 01:39:56.416
to see Cream happy.

01:39:58.916 --> 01:40:00.125
And Cream

01:40:02.125 --> 01:40:06.041
was willing to do anything
to make him happy

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:10.500
and peaceful before he died.

01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:19.208
How would an idiot like me
understand this kind of love?

01:40:33.958 --> 01:40:38.541
Then I will be fine

01:40:38.625 --> 01:40:42.875
I just wish that this hurt

01:40:42.958 --> 01:40:46.625
Will subside

01:40:57.375 --> 01:40:58.625
Forever.

01:41:12.625 --> 01:41:18.208
When I was

01:41:19.708 --> 01:41:24.208
Fine

01:41:41.083 --> 01:41:43.708
Now, these lyrics fit.

01:41:45.208 --> 01:41:46.666
You try and sing it.

01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:48.333
Why me?

01:41:48.416 --> 01:41:49.666
Yeah, you.

01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:51.041
But I'm not a good singer.

01:41:51.125 --> 01:41:53.333
It's okay. It's just a demo.

01:41:54.416 --> 01:41:56.208
This is our song now.

01:41:56.291 --> 01:41:58.333
Later, people will remember us
every time they hear it.

01:41:58.916 --> 01:42:00.250
One day,

01:42:00.333 --> 01:42:02.958
someone will hear our song

01:42:03.041 --> 01:42:07.750
and remember that there was
someone named K and Cream.

01:42:10.291 --> 01:42:11.291
I'll record now.

01:42:12.625 --> 01:42:14.041
One, two…

01:42:19.875 --> 01:42:25.000
This song is for you

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:31.166
And for the deceived heart

01:42:32.625 --> 01:42:35.416
You said that the world is

01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:41.458
Fine

01:42:42.875 --> 01:42:43.958
Yeah.

01:42:45.791 --> 01:42:49.250
Then I will be fine too

01:42:50.125 --> 01:42:53.708
I just wish that this hurt

01:42:53.791 --> 01:42:56.833
Will subside

01:42:57.625 --> 01:43:01.500
As I slowly forget

01:43:01.583 --> 01:43:06.416
Your voice

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:09.625
When I was

01:43:11.958 --> 01:43:14.875
Fine

01:43:17.333 --> 01:43:18.541

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.208
When I was

01:43:48.833 --> 01:43:52.125
