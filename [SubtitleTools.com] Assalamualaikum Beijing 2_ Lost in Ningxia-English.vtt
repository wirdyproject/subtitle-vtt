WEBVTT

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Rani.

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.791
Thank you.

00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:48.291
Arif?

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.625
Arif?

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.375
Arif?

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:56.458
Arif?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.416
Aisha?

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:00.375
Wake up, Aisha.

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:04.541
-Wake up.
-Why did you wake me up?

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:08.416
You look so sleepy.

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:12.500
Stop recording. Delete it.

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:13.458
Okay.

00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:15.166
Go back to sleep

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.041
so your dream continues.

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:21.500
Why did I have such a bad dream?

00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:22.791
Is it a sign?

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:26.000
It means you're missing Arif too much.

00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:29.083
Calm down. We'll arrive in 30 minutes.

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:31.583
You can make the most
of your time with him.

00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:47.250
We've arrived in China.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.625
Let's take a selfie, Aisha.

00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:50.875
Okay.

00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.750
Evy, smile for the selfie. Stop frowning.

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:56.875
We're here in China.
Everyone here is Chinese.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.083
Welcome. I'm Hastomo.

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:02.208
I came to pick you up here.

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.708
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:06.041
-Thank you.
-Why isn't he Chinese?

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:09.791
Aisha, don't you want to meet Arif now?

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:11.500
I'm ready to accompany you there.

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:13.000
Let's finish our job here first.

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:14.666
We'll be more relaxed afterward.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.416
Also, he's having his birthday
the day after tomorrow

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.625
so I want to surprise him.

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:21.416
Victor!

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:24.625
Focus on getting good shots.

00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:29.208
Mr. Hastomo, they always fight
wherever they go.

00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:32.583
I suspect they're actually soulmates.

00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:34.958
-Don't talk nonsense!
-They might be, Aisha.

00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:37.958
-Nauzubillahminzalik. No way!
-What does that mean?

00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:41.375
We seek refuge in God from bad things.

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:44.166
Am I that bad to you, Evy?

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.875
Oh, God. When I get married,
I bet you'll cry nonstop.

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.958
-"Don't leave me. I love you so much."
-Don't say anything back!

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:59.333
Evy, Aisha, and Victor,

00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:00.958
that's the restaurant.

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:02.916
You can eat there. I'll park the car.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.875
-Thank you, sir.
-Okay. You're welcome.

00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.291
-This one?
-Which one?

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:09.958
-This one. Let's go.
-Hurry up.

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.208
"Hurry up"? Stop rushing people.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.291
-It's a nice restaurant, isn't it?
-It is.

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:19.250
Where's the waitress?
There's no menu, either.

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:21.916
Relax, I ordered the food on our way here.
You just have to eat.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.500
You won't regret it because
the restaurant is run by an Indonesian.

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:27.875
There. I think that's ours.

00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.666
-Baba, you have customers.
-Thank you.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.500
Peace be upon you.

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:32.916
Peace be upon you too.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.375
Welcome to Ningxia.

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:37.125
My name is Rahman.

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:40.333
But people here call me "Baba."

00:04:40.416 --> 00:04:41.375
Baba.

00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:44.000
My name's Evy. This is Aisha, and…

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:46.500
Victor Panggabean. I'm from Medan.

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:49.833
Are you three going to cover
the event here tomorrow?

00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:52.250
-That's right.
-What's your name, cute girl?

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:53.208
Saabira.

00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:55.750
-Saabira. Nice to meet you. I'm Aisha.
-Nice to meet you.

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:59.333
Bira is my youngest kid.
She has an older brother.

00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:01.291
He's around your age.

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:03.208
But he's currently out,
taking care of something.

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:05.041
Taking care of his girlfriends.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.041
Girlfriends? He has plenty of them?

00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:10.291
He's such a playboy, then.

00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:11.625
-Victor.
-Just like me.

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:15.000
Bira, don't talk like that.

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:16.750
He does have a lot of girlfriends.

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:23.416
-Enjoy your meal. We'll chat later, okay?
-Sure.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.250
Thank you, Baba. Thank you, Bira.

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:29.041
We came all the way to China
just to eat noodles, Evy?

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:31.375
We often eat this kind of dish
in Pecenongan, Jakarta.

00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:33.125
Enjoy your meal.

00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:36.708
In the name of God.

00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:41.000
It tastes so good!

00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:43.666
-Right?
-It tastes so good!

00:05:45.708 --> 00:05:47.250
Eat slowly.

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:48.208
Hot!

00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:49.500
It's complimentary.

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:51.458
If you still need it tomorrow,

00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:53.500
-feel free to come back.
-It only costs one yuan?

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:54.583
It is!

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:57.083
If you don't believe me,
do you want to ask the others?

00:05:57.166 --> 00:06:00.000
-It's okay, Bira.
-Could you come here for a moment?

00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:03.375
They're curious
if this really costs one yuan.

00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:06.791
Hi! That's right.
I'm an Indonesian student.

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:10.583
When we are short on money, we eat here.

00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:14.416
But when we have extra money,
we'd pay more.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.500
Look at the banner over there.

00:06:16.583 --> 00:06:19.291
"Eat to your heart's content,
pay as you wish,

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:22.125
free for those in need"?

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:24.916
Hang on. Is this even profitable?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.083
You have a point.

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:32.041
Praise be to God, we made a huge profit.

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.875
I've been doing it this way
for almost ten years.

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.125
And as you see…

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.125
My restaurant is still running.

00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:42.125
Praise be to God,
our family has never lacked anything.

00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:45.083
If God's willing, it has given us
spiritual rewards and blessings.

00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:46.416
Amen.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.166
So what do I do now?

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.125
I've finished three bowls.

00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:51.458
What should I do?

00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:55.458
How about you bring the bowls inside
and you wash them?

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:56.833
Seriously?

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:57.916
-Saabira…
-Seriously.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.708
I wash the dishes? I'm in China, you know.

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:10.875
Hi, everyone. Welcome back
to the Indonesian news channel.

00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.875
Today, I'm at the Indonesian
and Chinese Cultural Festival.

00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.375
We will explore many things.

00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:18.875
Come with me, and stay until the end.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.375
-Is that Indonesian?
-Yes.

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:51.250
-Stand there. A bit closer, it's fine.
-Here.

00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:56.416
This is a dance
from the Indonesian students here.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.500
Let's watch.

00:07:58.291 --> 00:07:59.666
Move a little bit.

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:03.750
Sister.

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:07.291
I saw you filming.
You're so cool! I like it!

00:08:07.375 --> 00:08:10.708
When I grow up, I'd love to be like you.

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.708
Why do you want to be like me?

00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:14.541
I want to travel the world.

00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:16.000
I'd love to go to Indonesia.

00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:17.416
You've never been to Indonesia?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.291
I'd really love to.

00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:22.958
But I have to wait
until I'm a grown-up like you

00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:24.291
and go on my own.

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:27.291
Why do you want to go on your own?
Why won't you go with Baba?

00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:28.708
Peace be upon you, Aisha.

00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:29.916
Peace be upon you too, Baba.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.333
Baba is here.

00:08:31.416 --> 00:08:32.750
Is everything going well?

00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:34.458
Praise be to God, it does.

00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:37.625
But there are still some spots
that we still need to visit.

00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:38.916
Good, then.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.500
It's good that you're here, Baba.
Can we interview you?

00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:43.708
About what?

00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:47.083
Anything. About how you came to live here,

00:08:47.166 --> 00:08:49.708
your family, or any fun things!

00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:56.291
My life is not interesting. It's ordinary.

00:08:56.916 --> 00:08:59.000
Many other people have
more interesting lives.

00:08:59.083 --> 00:09:00.541
I still have things to do.

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:01.875
Bira, let's go.

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:05.041
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you too.

00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:06.250
Bye, Bira.

00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:08.791
Did I say something wrong?

00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:11.791
I don't know.
I will do some filming again, okay?

00:09:11.875 --> 00:09:13.041
Okay. Let's go.

00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:17.041
Evy, where is he?
What's taking him so long?

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:18.000
I'm sure right about now.

00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:21.166
Since Mr. Hastomo can't pick us up,
someone else will do it.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.958
He'll be here soon.
Just a moment. Be patient.

00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:25.041
-Maybe this one.
-Will it be the same car?

00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:27.291
It should be.
But, one second, let me check.

00:09:28.041 --> 00:09:30.375
It's heading here.
Maybe this is Mr. Hastomo.

00:09:30.458 --> 00:09:32.083
Wait, is it the car?

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:35.125
But he's coming here. He's getting off.

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:38.000
I don't think so.
The driver wouldn't be as handsome as…

00:09:38.083 --> 00:09:40.041
-Zhang Zhehan.
-What kind of Chinese food is that?

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:42.208
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you too.

00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:43.666
I'm Mr. Hastomo's replacement.

00:09:49.208 --> 00:09:51.541
Answer him. Don't space out. Evy!

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:52.666
-You understand the language.
-Right.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.000
Yes. Mr. Hastomo can't pick us up.
He's the replacement.

00:09:55.083 --> 00:09:56.916
We'll leave when you're ready.

00:09:58.166 --> 00:10:00.500
Sister, guard your eyes
and guard your heart.

00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:02.125
-Hey, hello!
-Is it really him?

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:04.291
-Hey!
-Okay, then. Let's go.

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:05.958
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:10:07.666 --> 00:10:09.666
Evy, I'm going to speak Chinese.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.458
-Watch me.
-Yes.

00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:12.916
Hello.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.875
What's your "namo"?

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:16.833
"Name."

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:18.125
What?

00:10:18.666 --> 00:10:21.583
Hello. What's your name?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.583
-Mo.
-Mo?

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.083
What's that short for?

00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:28.958
Mo.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.291
Read the one below.

00:10:31.375 --> 00:10:32.333
-This one?
-Yes.

00:10:32.416 --> 00:10:34.166
What's your complete name?

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.833
Why is it only

00:10:36.916 --> 00:10:39.666
"Moooo"?

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.166
Just call me "Mo."

00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:43.875
His name is just Mo.

00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:45.958
O…

00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:48.166
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.333
Hello, Mo. My name's Evy.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.250
-Aisha.
-Yes?

00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:57.500
Mr. Hastomo told me
all the passengers' names.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.500
He wasn't talking to you.

00:10:59.583 --> 00:11:01.750
He said Mr. Hastomo told him
all the passengers' names.

00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:03.958
He knows all of our names, including me?

00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:04.958
-It should be.
-Okay.

00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:08.541
So, you know my name?

00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:10.250
I forget.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.166
You can speak Indonesian?

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:17.875
I can.

00:11:19.166 --> 00:11:20.666
Why did I speak Chinese?

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.333
So, do you understand me right now?

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.375
You should've told me, Mo.

00:11:30.625 --> 00:11:33.833
I'm in Ningxia,
China's biggest Muslim territory.

00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:36.041
There are a lot
of historical footprints here.

00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:40.875
One of them is Daxuexixiang Mosque.
It was built in the year 705 A.D.

00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.708
It becomes a source of pride
for the Hui Muslims.

00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:46.625
I'm Aisha, reporting from Ningxia, China.

00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:47.875
Bye!

00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:52.000
Her hijab!

00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:00.458
Maybe you didn't tighten it enough.

00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:02.291
If worn correctly, it wouldn't slip off.

00:12:03.291 --> 00:12:04.166
Thanks, Mo.

00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:05.875
You're welcome.

00:12:07.916 --> 00:12:08.875
Let me help you.

00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:11.500
Okay.

00:12:11.583 --> 00:12:12.916
-Good?
-Good.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.833
Mo wants you to wear hijab correctly.

00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.541
Okay, stand by.

00:12:19.458 --> 00:12:21.083
Okay, Mo.

00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:31.791
-All good?
-All good.

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:34.375
-Thanks, Mo.
-You're welcome.

00:12:34.458 --> 00:12:36.541
Sorry for any shortcomings
while accompanying you.

00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.583
-No shortcoming.
-You only have one.

00:12:38.666 --> 00:12:39.708
You're handsome.

00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:42.500
Next to you, I look ugly in their eyes.

00:12:43.458 --> 00:12:45.208
Here. If you need my help.

00:12:45.291 --> 00:12:46.291
Okay.

00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:48.291
Okay. Thanks, Mo.

00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:49.583
You're welcome. Peace be upon you.

00:12:49.666 --> 00:12:51.208
-Peace be upon you too.
-Peace be upon you too.

00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:53.458
Why did he give the card to you?

00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:54.583
I'm the producer here.

00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:56.000
Why are you jealous?

00:12:56.083 --> 00:12:57.750
He's the owner, you know.

00:12:57.833 --> 00:12:58.708
Really?

00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:04.458
That's why he's handsome.

00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:05.500
He even gave his card.

00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:09.083
Why do girls judge guys
based on their looks?

00:13:10.875 --> 00:13:12.791
It's still morning
and he's getting a surprise.

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.875
How lucky this Arif guy is.

00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.583
According to this, this is the address.

00:13:16.666 --> 00:13:17.791
Thank you.

00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:34.333
-Can you hold both?
-I can.

00:13:34.416 --> 00:13:36.375
You're smiling so wide.

00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:41.000
Slowly.

00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:43.208
-We carry a lot of stuff.
-Thank you.

00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:44.916
Hello.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.125
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:13:46.208 --> 00:13:47.583
Can I help you with something?

00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:51.000
Do you know this person?

00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:52.083
Let me see.

00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:53.291
Does he live here?

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:54.333
Arif?

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:55.458
Correct.

00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:58.208
You can only visit briefly.
His room number is 1702.

00:13:58.291 --> 00:13:59.458
-Thank you.
-Okay.

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:03.000
Which one?

00:14:03.083 --> 00:14:05.041
-This one.
-Yes.

00:14:05.125 --> 00:14:06.208
Aisha!

00:14:07.458 --> 00:14:08.708
Light up the candles first.

00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:11.166
Okay.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.500
-Light up the rest, Evy.
-Be careful.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.583
I'll knock and we'll sing together, okay?

00:14:19.666 --> 00:14:20.708
Let me go first.

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:29.791
Call him.

00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:31.791
Arif!

00:14:32.541 --> 00:14:34.000
Arif!

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.083
Arif!

00:14:37.791 --> 00:14:39.833
Arif!

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:51.666
Who are you looking for? You…

00:14:54.208 --> 00:14:56.416
Sister, we're looking for Arif.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.708
-I don't know that name.
-She doesn't know.

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:03.166
Hang on, but the receptionist said
this is Arif's apartment.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.875
Maybe he's the previous owner.

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:10.875
Sister, have you ever seen this guy?

00:15:12.666 --> 00:15:13.875
Sorry.

00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.250
-Do you know him?
-I never saw him.

00:15:18.041 --> 00:15:20.041
Never saw him.

00:15:20.125 --> 00:15:22.250
-Sorry.
-Aisha, she doesn't know him.

00:15:27.375 --> 00:15:29.000
-Are you sure this is his room?
-Impossible.

00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:31.958
This is the right address.
The one he gave me.

00:15:32.041 --> 00:15:34.416
Well, that was also
what the receptionist said.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.500
Honey.

00:15:37.458 --> 00:15:38.708
Honey, open the door.

00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:41.458
Honey, open the door.

00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:43.916
Who are these people
and what are they doing here?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.125
I think they got the wrong address.

00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:47.625
This is my husband.

00:15:48.416 --> 00:15:49.583
Sorry.

00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:53.458
-That's her husband.
-Did she say "junk food"?

00:15:54.458 --> 00:15:55.750
Let's just go back down.

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.291
-Sorry to disturb you.
-Okay then.

00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:04.958
Why isn't Arif staying in room 1702?

00:16:05.041 --> 00:16:06.208
Arif?

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:09.708
-Arif?
-That's right.

00:16:09.791 --> 00:16:12.125
The last time I saw him was
three months ago.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.833
What did he say?

00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:18.000
-So unfriendly.
-Understood.

00:16:18.083 --> 00:16:20.500
If you're in Medan,
I would've slapped you many times.

00:16:20.583 --> 00:16:22.541
He used to live here three months ago,

00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:25.291
but he could've rented
the apartment to someone else.

00:16:25.375 --> 00:16:27.750
We were still texting last night,
he still lives here.

00:16:27.833 --> 00:16:30.000
We talked on the phone last night.

00:16:30.083 --> 00:16:31.708
That means he lied to you.

00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:36.583
-Aisha!
-The cake? Aisha.

00:16:36.666 --> 00:16:37.875
What about the cake? Hello?

00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.166
Aisha. Is this his campus?

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:41.875
It is.

00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.333
Are you sure?

00:16:43.416 --> 00:16:44.833
Excuse me.

00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:47.208
I'd like to get some information.

00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:49.916
Is he a student here?

00:16:50.458 --> 00:16:51.833
His name is Arif.

00:16:52.458 --> 00:16:53.625
Let me check.

00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:58.458
NAME: ARIF NIZART
ACADEMIC YEAR: 2024/2025

00:16:58.541 --> 00:17:00.583
It's been six months

00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:02.833
since Arif was last registered
as a student.

00:17:03.833 --> 00:17:05.375
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:09.000
Arif hasn't been registered
as a student for six months.

00:17:09.083 --> 00:17:10.375
Is it true?

00:17:10.458 --> 00:17:11.875
That was what the staff said.

00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.250
You just paid his tuition, didn't you?

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:16.625
Right?

00:17:17.708 --> 00:17:18.583
Valid?

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:22.583
Well, it's getting interesting!

00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:24.833
Victor.

00:17:25.916 --> 00:17:27.416
-Aisha.
-Did I say something wrong?

00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:29.375
-Aisha.
-Evy!

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.875
Where else are you going
to look for him, Aisha?

00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.291
What are you going to do?

00:17:35.583 --> 00:17:36.625
I don't know.

00:17:36.708 --> 00:17:40.208
He never told me
if he had any trouble or anything.

00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:43.166
So I don't know what to do.

00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:45.875
Victor, any idea?

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.708
It's easy to look for someone in Bekasi.

00:17:49.791 --> 00:17:51.166
I have a lot of friends there.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.375
But this is China.

00:17:52.458 --> 00:17:54.458
The language is different.
I cannot understand.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.875
Victor, can't you watch
what you're saying?

00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.333
Show some empathy!

00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:01.125
Haven't I shown enough empathy?

00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:04.916
She wanted to give him a surprise?
I accompanied her.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.583
She wanted to spy on his campus?
I was right behind you.

00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:10.500
This is our last day here.
We should go sightseeing.

00:18:10.583 --> 00:18:12.291
Buy souvenirs or whatever.

00:18:12.375 --> 00:18:14.083
-Right.
-Haven't I sacrificed enough?

00:18:14.166 --> 00:18:15.291
Okay, then.

00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:19.000
I'm sorry if I ruined your trip for you.

00:18:19.083 --> 00:18:21.750
But I have to process
a lot of things suddenly.

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:24.041
I'm still shocked. I'm confused.
I don't know what to do.

00:18:24.125 --> 00:18:25.500
You can go sightseeing without me.

00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:28.416
I'm going back to the hotel.
Once again, Victor, I'm so sorry.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.791
No, Aisha.

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.708
-Is she mad?
-Victor!

00:18:31.791 --> 00:18:32.750
Aisha!

00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:34.416
Aisha!

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.333
Gosh. I made another mistake.

00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:09.250
I know what it feels like
to be lied to by a guy.

00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:13.166
Especially after being
with someone for years.

00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:17.750
Good thing you found out he was lying now.

00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:19.333
If you found out after you're married,

00:19:19.416 --> 00:19:22.916
wouldn't that be more hurtful?
It would be harder.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.375
I've known for a long time

00:19:32.208 --> 00:19:33.916
that you often send money to him.

00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:38.458
Do you realize that
you've been so generous to him?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.958
I just didn't expect him
to be that cruel to you.

00:19:44.708 --> 00:19:47.791
In fact, he knows
you don't have anyone else.

00:19:50.916 --> 00:19:51.958
It's okay.

00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:55.125
Just cry it out.
Let's hope it'll calm you down.

00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:58.208
But you have to remember,

00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:00.250
the storm will pass.

00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:06.416
I just don't want
anything bad to happen to you.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.291
I care about you, Aisha.

00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:18.458
It's okay.

00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:20.000
It's okay, Aisha.

00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:30.916
Here, let me help you.

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:35.375
-Let me help you.
-Okay. Thank you, Mo.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.875
Too bad you have to go back this soon.

00:20:59.416 --> 00:21:03.666
There are still a lot of beautiful
and historical places you have to visit.

00:21:04.333 --> 00:21:05.708
We'd love to stay longer.

00:21:05.791 --> 00:21:08.166
Especially Aisha.
She wants to see the City Wall.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:09.750
Right, Aisha?

00:21:10.291 --> 00:21:12.000
We're going to come back.

00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:13.791
But we have to save some money first.

00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:16.291
I'd be happy
to take you guys around again.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:19.166
You should've talked this much before.

00:21:19.875 --> 00:21:21.083
We wouldn't be going home today.

00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:24.833
This is my first time taking
my customers around myself.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:30.250
So, I'm nervous. I don't know what to do.

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:33.958
I thought you were a cool guy.
Turns out you can be nervous too.

00:21:34.041 --> 00:21:36.041
You're an ordinary human being.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.625
What's wrong with Aisha?

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.083
She has a toothache.

00:21:44.458 --> 00:21:47.250
Having a toothache is
better than a heartbreak.

00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:50.041
You know that dangdut song?
You listen to dangdut too?

00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:01.375
Luggage, Mo.

00:22:01.458 --> 00:22:02.375
Okay.

00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:23.291
Mo, let me.

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.458
It's okay. Let me.

00:22:24.541 --> 00:22:25.750
I'll accompany you inside.

00:22:25.833 --> 00:22:27.708
It's okay, Mo. You can leave now.

00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:28.916
Okay.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.708
-Thank you.
-Okay. You're welcome.

00:22:31.291 --> 00:22:33.000
-Mo.
-Have a safe journey!

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.916
YINCHUAN STATION

00:22:50.791 --> 00:22:52.416
Has the train departed?

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.500
I think the train will leave soon.

00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:56.958
Check your belongings.
Have you checked yours?

00:22:57.041 --> 00:22:58.625
I don't want us to leave anything here.

00:22:58.708 --> 00:23:00.541
The camera is here. Everything's here.

00:23:00.625 --> 00:23:02.208
-Check everything.
-I have.

00:23:02.833 --> 00:23:05.416
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure, Evy. They're all here.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.583
Aisha.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.375
What are you doing here, Mo?

00:23:09.458 --> 00:23:12.208
I bought you
this Chinese toothache medicine.

00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:13.666
This works wonders.

00:23:16.083 --> 00:23:17.208
Thanks, Mo.

00:23:17.833 --> 00:23:19.791
You're welcome. Have a safe journey.

00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:21.083
Yes. Thank you, Mo.

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:22.916
That's it?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.333
Thank you, Mo.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.666
He really bought it for you.

00:23:27.375 --> 00:23:28.958
-Keep it as a souvenir.
-Let's go.

00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:30.041
That's it.

00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:03.458
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Okay.

00:24:30.708 --> 00:24:31.916
Where's Aisha?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.125
She's going to the restroom.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.291
What's taking her so long?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.208
The train will depart very soon.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.750
Yeah.

00:24:55.958 --> 00:24:58.000
TRAIN FROM NINGXIA TO BEIJING: DEPARTED

00:25:08.416 --> 00:25:09.500
Mo.

00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:14.541
What's taking her so long? Where is she?

00:25:14.625 --> 00:25:15.708
Is she locked inside the restroom?

00:25:15.791 --> 00:25:17.916
Stop making me more panicked.

00:25:19.208 --> 00:25:22.041
-Evy. Where is she?
-Hang on.

00:25:22.708 --> 00:25:23.958
She's texting me.

00:25:24.833 --> 00:25:27.041
Evy, Victor.

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:29.125
Sorry, I'm not going home with you.

00:25:29.833 --> 00:25:32.000
I'll be staying here for a few days.

00:25:32.083 --> 00:25:35.250
I need to meet Arif, no matter what.

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:39.041
Because I still can't believe
he can do this to me.

00:25:39.125 --> 00:25:43.958
I still hope his reason
was not to betray me.

00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:47.583
But if he really did,

00:25:47.666 --> 00:25:51.250
I want to know the reason
for him to be that cruel.

00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:55.875
Evy, just go back home with Victor.

00:25:56.916 --> 00:25:58.750
You don't need to worry about me.

00:25:58.833 --> 00:26:00.750
I can take care of myself here.

00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:03.083
Sorry for troubling you.

00:26:03.833 --> 00:26:05.458
-Victor.
-What?

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:07.833
What?

00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:08.916
She's not coming with us.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.375
What do you mean?
So, it's only the two of us?

00:26:11.458 --> 00:26:12.666
What should we do?

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.708
I don't understand. What's up with her?

00:26:14.791 --> 00:26:16.291
Just say something to her.

00:26:16.375 --> 00:26:18.000
Deal with her yourself.

00:26:19.458 --> 00:26:22.208
What do you mean by "deal"?
Should I get off? The train has departed.

00:26:22.291 --> 00:26:23.750
I don't know, Victor!

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:25.750
Can you stop asking questions?

00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:28.500
Don't be mad. I was only asking.

00:26:34.333 --> 00:26:35.291
Mo.

00:26:36.708 --> 00:26:38.291
Sorry for venting.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.458
Because I don't have anyone here.
You're the only one who can help me.

00:26:44.125 --> 00:26:46.791
No matter how much I have to pay,

00:26:46.875 --> 00:26:48.583
just tell me and I'll pay you.

00:26:48.666 --> 00:26:51.875
Do you have any contact
or the address of his friends here?

00:26:53.708 --> 00:26:54.708
I don't.

00:26:54.791 --> 00:26:56.208
Reckless.

00:26:59.625 --> 00:27:00.583
What?

00:27:03.291 --> 00:27:04.208
Reckless.

00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:07.375
I'm not. I have a plan.

00:27:08.416 --> 00:27:11.000
I have several photos of him in China.

00:27:11.083 --> 00:27:13.875
Maybe you know the person or the location.

00:27:13.958 --> 00:27:15.583
We can start from there.

00:27:22.916 --> 00:27:24.791
I know the location of some of his photos.

00:27:24.875 --> 00:27:26.583
Let's start with the nearest one.

00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:28.500
Okay.

00:27:35.375 --> 00:27:37.583
I have a question.
Have you ever met this guy?

00:27:37.666 --> 00:27:39.583
He's been here.

00:27:39.666 --> 00:27:42.166
He prayed here once,
but he never came back.

00:27:42.791 --> 00:27:44.000
Okay.

00:27:44.666 --> 00:27:46.375
-Thank you.
-Peace be upon you.

00:27:46.458 --> 00:27:48.250
-Peace be upon you too.
-Goodbye.

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:49.541
What did he say?

00:27:49.625 --> 00:27:52.500
Arif has only been here once
to pray and take some photos.

00:27:52.583 --> 00:27:54.375
He doesn't know Arif personally.

00:27:54.458 --> 00:27:57.750
When Arif wrote that
he stayed here for a week,

00:27:57.833 --> 00:27:58.708
that was a lie.

00:28:00.708 --> 00:28:01.583
Okay.

00:28:03.125 --> 00:28:05.041
CIVILIZED CAMPUS, NO SMOKING

00:28:07.208 --> 00:28:08.208
Arif?

00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:11.166
The last time I saw him was
about five to six months ago.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.041
I heard he worked
at the solar energy research center.

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:15.416
Where is that?

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.250
-Shapotou.
-Shapotou?

00:28:17.333 --> 00:28:18.375
Oh, yeah.

00:28:19.125 --> 00:28:20.416
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.875
Mo, do you know where that is?

00:28:23.958 --> 00:28:26.375
Shapotou is six to seven hours from here.

00:28:26.458 --> 00:28:29.458
Can you please take me there?

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:31.125
No matter how much the fee is,
I'll pay you.

00:28:31.208 --> 00:28:32.666
-Just tell me the total amount.
-Later.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.583
-It's okay. I can pay you now.
-Later. After everything is done.

00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:39.750
Thanks, Mo.

00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:07.041
Mo, where are we?

00:29:07.875 --> 00:29:09.375
We're almost there.

00:29:09.458 --> 00:29:10.833
I slept for a long time, didn't I?

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.958
If you want to eat, there's food.

00:29:16.583 --> 00:29:18.375
Mo, I'm so sorry.

00:29:18.458 --> 00:29:20.583
It should've been me who bought the food.
I'll pay you back.

00:29:21.208 --> 00:29:22.416
It's okay.

00:29:51.666 --> 00:29:53.041
Is this as far as we can go?

00:29:53.125 --> 00:29:54.958
Can't we go up there?

00:29:55.041 --> 00:29:57.083
We can't.
We're not allowed to enter freely, Aisha.

00:29:58.333 --> 00:29:59.791
I can't. We've come this far.

00:29:59.875 --> 00:30:02.000
-We have to try.
-It's written there.

00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:04.416
-We have to have permission.
-It's only a formality. Let's just try.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.791
We can't. I'm from here.
I know the rule here.

00:30:06.875 --> 00:30:09.208
Since you're from here,
it should be easier, right?

00:30:09.291 --> 00:30:11.416
That's not right.

00:30:13.625 --> 00:30:14.916
Aisha, come back.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.291
It's okay. I'll just go alone.

00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:18.041
Don't be reckless. Go back! Aisha!

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.708
Aisha, let's go back and leave.

00:30:20.791 --> 00:30:22.000
Aisha!

00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:25.375
Aisha! If you continue,
I will not be held responsible.

00:30:25.458 --> 00:30:27.458
-I'll wait for you here.
-Okay!

00:30:36.083 --> 00:30:37.041
Aisha.

00:30:37.916 --> 00:30:40.083
Love may be blind, but that doesn't mean
it doesn't need logic.

00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:43.541
Who says so?

00:30:43.625 --> 00:30:45.916
Mo, you don't know about me and Arif.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.041
It's your business.

00:30:47.708 --> 00:30:49.083
The problem is that it involves me.

00:30:49.166 --> 00:30:52.541
I'm not involving you.
Your job is to take me here.

00:30:52.625 --> 00:30:54.500
The problem is
you're my responsibility now.

00:30:54.583 --> 00:30:55.791
Stop, Aisha.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.750
Let's try another way.
This is dangerous, Aisha.

00:30:59.916 --> 00:31:00.791
Aisha.

00:31:03.083 --> 00:31:04.166
Mo.

00:31:05.291 --> 00:31:06.458
Stop there.

00:31:06.541 --> 00:31:07.500
What are you doing here?

00:31:07.583 --> 00:31:10.083
Mo, I think we can ask them.

00:31:10.166 --> 00:31:11.375
Hello.

00:31:11.458 --> 00:31:12.291
Don't move!

00:31:12.375 --> 00:31:13.833
-Hello…
-We're lost.

00:31:14.375 --> 00:31:15.208
Hold on.

00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:17.166
-I'm with a tourist from Indonesia.
-Wait.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.083
Hello.

00:31:18.666 --> 00:31:20.250
What for?

00:31:21.375 --> 00:31:22.708
What is she talking about?

00:31:22.791 --> 00:31:23.791
-Let's just try.
-Not sure.

00:31:23.875 --> 00:31:25.708
-Search them.
-Don't move!

00:31:25.791 --> 00:31:27.208
Hands up!

00:31:27.291 --> 00:31:28.541
-Hands up, Aisha.
-Don't touch me.

00:31:28.625 --> 00:31:30.416
-Hey! Stop!
-Hands up.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.125
-Don't touch her!
-Help!

00:31:32.208 --> 00:31:33.500
Don't move!

00:31:33.583 --> 00:31:35.875
-Okay!
-Don't move!

00:31:35.958 --> 00:31:37.833
Don't move!

00:31:37.916 --> 00:31:40.000
-Mo!
-Don't move!

00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:41.166
Aisha!

00:31:41.958 --> 00:31:43.166
Mo!

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.541
No!

00:31:47.333 --> 00:31:48.833
-Bring him here.
-Move!

00:31:49.625 --> 00:31:51.250
No!

00:31:51.333 --> 00:31:53.625
-Aisha, show them your passport.
-Wait.

00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:58.291
We're here looking for someone.

00:32:04.625 --> 00:32:05.458
Don't move!

00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:24.125
This project was closed a year ago.

00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:25.625
We're guarding this place.

00:32:26.958 --> 00:32:28.375
This is a restricted area.

00:32:28.458 --> 00:32:30.083
You're not supposed to be here.

00:32:30.166 --> 00:32:31.125
Leave now.

00:32:34.125 --> 00:32:35.666
Go!

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.583
Leave now!

00:32:47.625 --> 00:32:51.375
I'm so sorry, Mo. I'm at fault here.

00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:56.291
Here, let me.

00:32:56.375 --> 00:32:57.416
Is this alcohol?

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.083
-Yes.
-Okay.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:02.416
Sorry, I'll…

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.916
It's okay. Let me do it myself.

00:33:12.583 --> 00:33:14.083
If that didn't happen,

00:33:14.916 --> 00:33:16.458
you wouldn't believe me, would you?

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.916
I was just making an effort, Mo.
Shouldn't we…

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.125
Shouldn't we make an effort
if we want something?

00:33:24.875 --> 00:33:26.416
Sorry, I'm in the wrong.

00:33:31.166 --> 00:33:32.416
They said

00:33:33.333 --> 00:33:35.708
the project was closed a year ago.

00:33:36.958 --> 00:33:38.875
There's no worker there now.

00:33:39.625 --> 00:33:40.875
Just the security guards.

00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:47.708
Let me help you.

00:33:52.291 --> 00:33:53.708
-Excuse me, Mo.
-Yeah?

00:33:53.791 --> 00:33:54.625
Your hair.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.291
Mo.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:12.791
There are lots of cuts on your arms.

00:34:12.875 --> 00:34:14.541
Do you want me to…

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:17.833
Thank you.

00:34:39.833 --> 00:34:40.750
Aisha.

00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:44.458
Sorry for being harsh to you earlier.

00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:47.291
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

00:34:47.833 --> 00:34:49.166
It's okay, Mo.

00:34:49.916 --> 00:34:52.291
You're right. Love needs logic.

00:34:53.416 --> 00:34:56.708
I was at fault.
I should be the one apologizing.

00:34:56.791 --> 00:34:59.625
Yes, but I shouldn't have done that.

00:35:02.666 --> 00:35:06.750
Everyone has done something
illogical out of love.

00:35:09.458 --> 00:35:11.875
My mom died giving birth to me.

00:35:21.333 --> 00:35:23.458
After my dad died,

00:35:23.541 --> 00:35:25.291
I only have Arif.

00:35:33.416 --> 00:35:35.000
He's always on my side.

00:35:35.083 --> 00:35:36.750
He always accompanies me.

00:35:36.833 --> 00:35:38.625
He always supports me.

00:35:44.083 --> 00:35:47.375
Maybe that's why I'm too dependent on him.

00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:13.083
I want to perform the Maghrib prayer.

00:36:30.125 --> 00:36:31.291
Do you want to pray together?

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:34.750
No, thanks. You go first.

00:36:34.833 --> 00:36:36.375
You're having a problem now.

00:36:37.208 --> 00:36:38.875
It's better for you to ask for God's help.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.291
God is the Greatest.

00:37:08.416 --> 00:37:09.291
Hello, Evy.

00:37:09.375 --> 00:37:11.375
Gosh, Aisha.
Why is it so hard to call you?

00:37:11.458 --> 00:37:13.958
Where are you? Are you okay?

00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:15.833
Have you met Arif?

00:37:15.916 --> 00:37:18.958
One question at a time, or else,
she'll be more confused.

00:37:19.583 --> 00:37:20.750
Slow down.

00:37:21.291 --> 00:37:22.791
I'm in Ningxia.

00:37:23.375 --> 00:37:25.458
I still can't find Arif.

00:37:25.541 --> 00:37:26.541
How about this?

00:37:26.625 --> 00:37:29.208
Tomorrow morning,
you fly to Beijing as early as possible,

00:37:29.291 --> 00:37:30.833
and then we fly home together.

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:32.750
I'll book you the ticket.
I'll handle everything.

00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:34.833
Stop thinking about that crazy Arif, okay?

00:37:34.916 --> 00:37:36.625
Aisha, we came here together,

00:37:36.708 --> 00:37:37.875
so we have to go home together too.

00:37:37.958 --> 00:37:39.416
I appreciate your concern.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.583
But relax, I can take care of myself here.

00:37:42.208 --> 00:37:44.416
Okay? I'm hanging up now, Evy.
Safe flight.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.916
Wait! Don't hang up just yet.
Where's Mo? I want to talk to him.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.208
Mo is praying.

00:37:48.291 --> 00:37:50.333
I'm hanging up now, Evy. Bye.

00:37:50.416 --> 00:37:51.833
Safe flight. Peace be upon you.

00:37:52.916 --> 00:37:54.291
Hello?

00:38:15.458 --> 00:38:17.541
Victor, what now?
I can't stop worrying about Aisha.

00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:19.958
What else should we do? Go back there?

00:38:20.041 --> 00:38:21.666
It's far.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.875
If we stay together longer,
we'll fall for each other.

00:38:26.125 --> 00:38:27.416
I mean…

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:31.458
I'm worried about Aisha, but I trust Mo.

00:38:31.541 --> 00:38:33.125
She'll be all right.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.541
Just like we'll be all right
until we get married.

00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:42.083
Victor, I'm not joking.

00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:43.708
But I'm serious, Evy.

00:38:43.791 --> 00:38:45.625
I'm also serious here.
Don't be delusional.

00:38:53.041 --> 00:38:56.208
Victor. Isn't that the girl
from the apartment?

00:38:57.041 --> 00:38:59.500
And is that Arif? It is Arif!

00:38:59.583 --> 00:39:00.708
Wait! Our food!

00:39:00.791 --> 00:39:02.416
-Our food, Evy!
-Arif!

00:39:04.458 --> 00:39:05.375
Arif!

00:39:08.666 --> 00:39:09.500
Is that Arif?

00:39:10.208 --> 00:39:11.166
Sorry.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:12.166
-Evy!
-Arif!

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.708
TAXI

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:17.875
Why were you so slow? We lost him!

00:39:17.958 --> 00:39:19.208
You're wasting our food.

00:39:19.291 --> 00:39:20.916
Are you even sure that's Arif?

00:39:21.875 --> 00:39:24.833
Not really, but he turned around
when I called him.

00:39:24.916 --> 00:39:26.875
Who wouldn't turn around
when you call them?

00:39:26.958 --> 00:39:28.625
Your voice is like a treble.

00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:31.041
-Victor?
-See?

00:39:31.125 --> 00:39:32.958
Don't waste our food.

00:39:33.041 --> 00:39:34.791
Our bags are still there too.
Let's just go back.

00:39:34.875 --> 00:39:37.083
-Thanks, Mo.
-You're welcome.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.541
When did you start living here?

00:39:41.958 --> 00:39:43.625
Since I was seven.

00:39:43.708 --> 00:39:45.333
All of your family live here?

00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:46.666
Yes.

00:39:48.916 --> 00:39:50.750
So, what's your plan now?

00:39:52.208 --> 00:39:53.875
Do you still want to find your boyfriend?

00:39:56.791 --> 00:39:59.416
Before I fell in love

00:40:00.458 --> 00:40:01.833
and when I fall in love,

00:40:01.916 --> 00:40:03.791
I should've been ready
to have my heart broken.

00:40:05.833 --> 00:40:07.125
Yes, and…

00:40:08.458 --> 00:40:10.750
the bigger our love for someone,

00:40:12.208 --> 00:40:13.583
the bigger

00:40:13.666 --> 00:40:16.208
the pain they can cause us
when they disappear.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.541
Agree.

00:40:30.958 --> 00:40:32.750
Are you still going to take me?

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:36.541
Of course.

00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:37.958
Okay.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:40.708
Are you done eating?

00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:41.916
Just a bit more.

00:40:45.541 --> 00:40:46.500
Let's go.

00:40:49.416 --> 00:40:51.208
-Aisha, can you open the door?
-Okay.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.291
Forgive me, God.

00:41:08.291 --> 00:41:09.500
The car won't start.

00:41:10.666 --> 00:41:11.833
Just a moment.

00:41:24.125 --> 00:41:25.625
I think the battery is low.

00:41:25.708 --> 00:41:27.708
Hang on. Let me get some help.

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:36.000
Hello?

00:41:36.083 --> 00:41:38.416
Hi. My car won't start.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.708
At…

00:41:39.791 --> 00:41:40.833
Hello?

00:41:41.875 --> 00:41:43.000
Hello?

00:41:45.208 --> 00:41:46.166
My phone's dead.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:47.583
What should we do, then?

00:41:50.791 --> 00:41:52.291
-There's a car coming.
-Okay, then.

00:41:52.375 --> 00:41:53.750
Stop them!

00:41:56.583 --> 00:41:58.208
Hey! Hello!

00:42:11.625 --> 00:42:12.875
Sorry for my recklessness.

00:42:12.958 --> 00:42:16.000
Well, what else can we do?

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.625
Hey!

00:42:19.708 --> 00:42:20.708
Stop!

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.000
It's okay. You just wait in the car.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.583
There will be another car.

00:42:33.166 --> 00:42:34.166
Okay, then.

00:42:47.583 --> 00:42:48.958
I can't sleep.

00:42:50.958 --> 00:42:52.208
Just sit here.

00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:18.875
Aisha?

00:43:24.541 --> 00:43:26.500
My name was Rani Angelina.

00:43:33.083 --> 00:43:34.625
Before I knew Arif.

00:43:36.583 --> 00:43:38.083
Arif…

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.083
reminded me that someone cared about me.

00:43:45.375 --> 00:43:48.000
He had filled my days

00:43:48.083 --> 00:43:50.208
until he went to study in China.

00:43:51.083 --> 00:43:53.958
And he did that for our future.

00:43:56.625 --> 00:43:59.791
So, if you ask me
if he's worth fighting for,

00:43:59.875 --> 00:44:01.041
the answer is yes.

00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:04.125
He's worth fighting for.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.750
I recently converted.

00:44:14.666 --> 00:44:17.041
I thought I was going
to be happy with him.

00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:20.958
I thought I was going
to marry him and we'd be together.

00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:31.333
Turns out he's lying
and I haven't even heard from him.

00:44:36.958 --> 00:44:38.041
Do you know

00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:42.083
that we're never really alone?

00:44:43.916 --> 00:44:45.750
Because God is always with us.

00:44:49.458 --> 00:44:51.000
He's the Almighty Protector.

00:44:51.083 --> 00:44:52.000
And…

00:44:52.708 --> 00:44:55.208
He will protect you better
than anyone else

00:44:55.791 --> 00:44:56.791
from anything.

00:44:58.416 --> 00:45:00.208
Sorry for being presumptuous.

00:45:01.416 --> 00:45:04.000
But who did you convert for?

00:45:06.625 --> 00:45:08.208
Ideally, you do that for God.

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.875
But if there's another reason,

00:45:14.583 --> 00:45:16.458
I hope that becomes
your process to be better.

00:46:04.958 --> 00:46:06.000
Mo.

00:46:09.125 --> 00:46:10.083
Aisha.

00:46:10.166 --> 00:46:11.625
Would you be my imam?

00:46:18.583 --> 00:46:19.750
What do you mean?

00:46:20.958 --> 00:46:22.500
To lead the prayer?

00:46:25.125 --> 00:46:26.125
Sorry, Aisha.

00:46:27.708 --> 00:46:29.083
I can't be your imam.

00:46:30.916 --> 00:46:32.250
If there's only the two of us,

00:46:32.333 --> 00:46:33.833
you're not my mahram.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.875
So let's pray on our own, okay?

00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:41.291
Okay.

00:46:41.875 --> 00:46:43.625
God is the Greatest.

00:46:43.708 --> 00:46:45.958
God is the Greatest.

00:46:49.416 --> 00:46:50.791
God is the Greatest.

00:46:52.125 --> 00:46:53.875
God is the Greatest.

00:47:00.791 --> 00:47:02.541
God is the Greatest.

00:47:04.791 --> 00:47:06.458
God is the Greatest.

00:47:10.458 --> 00:47:12.333
God is the Greatest.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.500
God is the Greatest.

00:47:19.541 --> 00:47:21.333
God is the Greatest.

00:47:49.208 --> 00:47:50.750
Peace be upon you.

00:47:53.375 --> 00:47:54.375
Mo!

00:47:54.458 --> 00:47:55.833
He's taking our belongings, Mo!

00:47:55.916 --> 00:47:57.500
Hey, Mo! Mo!

00:47:57.583 --> 00:48:00.500
-Mo!
-Hey! Stop!

00:48:00.583 --> 00:48:03.250
Hey! Mo!

00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:04.625
Hey! Don't!

00:48:05.958 --> 00:48:07.500
-Hey!
-Stop!

00:48:21.416 --> 00:48:22.458
It's all gone!

00:48:23.083 --> 00:48:24.000
Calm down.

00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:25.458
How am I supposed to calm down?

00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:29.291
My passport, my phone, my iPad, my work!

00:48:29.375 --> 00:48:30.458
Everything is in the bag!

00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:32.416
Okay. Calm down now.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.666
So we can think.

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:36.208
I called you when you prayed, but you…

00:48:37.333 --> 00:48:39.208
Mo, what should we do? Everything's gone!

00:48:39.291 --> 00:48:40.791
We don't know where my stuff is!

00:48:40.875 --> 00:48:42.500
I didn't know their intentions.

00:48:43.083 --> 00:48:46.000
We shouldn't think negatively
especially when we're praying.

00:48:54.833 --> 00:48:55.958
What's the point…

00:48:56.625 --> 00:48:58.166
What's the point of me praying…

00:49:00.166 --> 00:49:03.041
What's the point of me praying
if this is how my prayers are answered?

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.083
Forgive me, God.

00:49:06.166 --> 00:49:07.583
The car won't start!

00:49:07.666 --> 00:49:10.291
And the phone's dead.

00:49:13.666 --> 00:49:14.625
Aisha.

00:49:14.708 --> 00:49:16.791
No good intention ever goes to waste.

00:49:28.625 --> 00:49:30.666
So, what do we do now?

00:49:36.583 --> 00:49:37.583
Hello!

00:49:48.833 --> 00:49:50.583
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

00:49:50.666 --> 00:49:55.375
Someone called me and told me
a car broke down here.

00:49:55.458 --> 00:49:58.041
He was with an ill person
and he couldn't stop.

00:49:58.125 --> 00:50:00.125
Because he was in a hurry
to get to the hospital.

00:50:00.208 --> 00:50:02.291
He asked me to fix your car.

00:50:02.875 --> 00:50:03.750
Thank you.

00:50:03.833 --> 00:50:05.250
The battery's low.

00:50:06.291 --> 00:50:07.416
Please fix it.

00:50:09.125 --> 00:50:10.875
Open the hood.

00:50:16.125 --> 00:50:17.291
The mechanic said he received a call

00:50:17.375 --> 00:50:20.291
from someone who saw
our broken-down car here.

00:50:21.583 --> 00:50:23.791
But they couldn't stop
because they were with a sick person.

00:50:24.833 --> 00:50:25.708
It's more urgent.

00:50:25.791 --> 00:50:27.208
Done. Try to start it.

00:50:31.416 --> 00:50:32.416
All good.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.958
Thank you.

00:50:41.041 --> 00:50:41.958
You're welcome.

00:50:43.291 --> 00:50:45.166
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

00:50:48.333 --> 00:50:50.166
Who moves the hearts of humans?

00:51:32.041 --> 00:51:33.208
Get out of the car.

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:41.208
-Hello.
-Hello. What's the matter?

00:51:41.291 --> 00:51:42.375
We want to report something.

00:51:42.458 --> 00:51:43.875
Report? Please come here.

00:51:44.666 --> 00:51:47.833
POLICE STATION

00:51:47.916 --> 00:51:49.291
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:51:49.375 --> 00:51:50.666
Her bag was stolen.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.708
Where and when?

00:51:53.375 --> 00:51:55.166
At six in the morning, at Mount Helan.

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:57.000
Let me write the report.

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:02.250
Give me a contact number.

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:12.875
Okay. If there's any progress,
we will contact you.

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.541
Okay, thank you.

00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:17.291
Thank you.

00:52:20.125 --> 00:52:21.708
Let's hope they find your things.

00:52:24.666 --> 00:52:25.791
Are you hungry?

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.708
What do you want to eat?

00:52:28.958 --> 00:52:29.916
Aisha.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:32.416
Say something.

00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:35.208
I don't know what I want to eat.

00:52:35.291 --> 00:52:37.500
My stuffs are gone.

00:52:37.583 --> 00:52:39.458
I don't have anyone here.

00:52:43.666 --> 00:52:45.291
But I held this.

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:48.416
This is all I have.

00:52:49.583 --> 00:52:50.958
It's unimportant.

00:52:53.916 --> 00:52:55.458
Whatever.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.125
Aisha, once again, I'm sorry.

00:53:14.708 --> 00:53:15.666
It's okay.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.541
Do you know Baba's noodle restaurant?

00:53:19.625 --> 00:53:21.333
Every Indonesian here surely knows it.

00:53:22.083 --> 00:53:23.541
Take me there.

00:53:41.083 --> 00:53:42.458
Aisha.

00:53:42.541 --> 00:53:43.583
Yes?

00:53:43.666 --> 00:53:45.000
I'm going to park the car, okay?

00:53:45.083 --> 00:53:46.041
Okay.

00:54:18.375 --> 00:54:20.000
Peace be upon you, Bira.

00:54:20.083 --> 00:54:21.583
Aisha?

00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:24.541
Sorry, you wore a hijab before.

00:54:24.625 --> 00:54:26.375
I just don't want to mistake you
for someone else.

00:54:27.166 --> 00:54:28.375
Are you coming alone?

00:54:28.458 --> 00:54:30.250
No, I'm with my friend.

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:32.208
-He's coming.
-Peace be upon you.

00:54:32.875 --> 00:54:35.250
-Bira, I want to…
-Mo!

00:54:35.333 --> 00:54:36.375
Where were you?

00:54:36.458 --> 00:54:37.916
Dad was worried, you know?

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.250
You didn't pick up your phone.

00:54:39.333 --> 00:54:41.291
Dad was worried you were in trouble
with the police again.

00:54:41.375 --> 00:54:42.458
That you were fighting again.

00:54:46.708 --> 00:54:48.916
Aisha, he's my brother.

00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:55.416
Why didn't you tell me you're Baba's son?

00:54:56.083 --> 00:54:58.208
You two know each other?

00:54:58.291 --> 00:54:59.125
How?

00:54:59.208 --> 00:55:00.666
Bira.

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.750
She came here for Dad's noodle,
not to tell you stories.

00:55:04.958 --> 00:55:06.291
Stay with my sister.

00:55:07.375 --> 00:55:08.500
Ask her what she wants to eat.

00:55:09.291 --> 00:55:10.208
Okay.

00:55:11.333 --> 00:55:12.500
What do you want to order?

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.500
Thanks, Mo.

00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:35.041
You're welcome.

00:55:36.333 --> 00:55:37.958
Peace be upon you, Aisha.

00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:39.875
Peace be upon you too, Baba.

00:55:39.958 --> 00:55:41.083
-Dad.
-Yeah.

00:55:42.458 --> 00:55:43.958
Welcome back.

00:55:45.791 --> 00:55:47.791
He told me everything.

00:55:47.875 --> 00:55:49.625
There's a bedroom you can occupy

00:55:49.708 --> 00:55:51.916
until all of your problems here
are solved.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.791
Baba, thank you.

00:55:53.875 --> 00:55:56.041
It was all his idea.

00:55:59.708 --> 00:56:00.916
Mohammad.

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:05.416
You don't need to ask for advice from him.

00:56:06.458 --> 00:56:07.666
Don't refuse this, okay?

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:10.916
Yes, Baba.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.166
Let's drink.

00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:19.625
Okay, then.

00:56:20.375 --> 00:56:21.375
I'm going to leave you be, okay?

00:56:21.458 --> 00:56:26.083
Baba, once again, thank you so much.

00:56:26.166 --> 00:56:27.250
You're welcome, Aisha.

00:56:43.375 --> 00:56:44.458
Mohammad?

00:56:46.541 --> 00:56:47.916
Why did you keep it a secret?

00:56:50.125 --> 00:56:51.208
I was worried

00:56:51.958 --> 00:56:54.375
that my behavior and actions
are far from The Prophet's.

00:56:56.458 --> 00:57:00.333
Dad gave me that name so that I'm mindful
of my behavior and actions.

00:57:01.625 --> 00:57:04.333
So, you don't mind staying
at my family's house, right?

00:57:05.041 --> 00:57:07.625
Mo, I asked you to take me here

00:57:07.708 --> 00:57:10.000
because I wanted to ask for Baba's help.

00:57:11.083 --> 00:57:13.291
It's a coincidence that

00:57:13.375 --> 00:57:14.708
Baba is your family.

00:57:20.708 --> 00:57:22.333
We've lived here for a long time.

00:57:23.375 --> 00:57:24.291
Peace be upon you.

00:57:24.375 --> 00:57:27.250
Peace be upon you too.
Mo, you're finally home.

00:57:27.333 --> 00:57:29.291
Yes, I'm finally home.

00:57:29.375 --> 00:57:31.666
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you.

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:35.083
When I was little,
I could only play with Mo.

00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:38.125
This is one of the Muslim villages here.

00:57:38.208 --> 00:57:39.125
Peace be upon you.

00:57:39.208 --> 00:57:40.666
-Peace be upon you too.
-Same to you.

00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:42.791
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you too.

00:57:42.875 --> 00:57:44.708
Mo, where's your dad?

00:57:44.791 --> 00:57:45.791
He's still at the restaurant.

00:57:45.875 --> 00:57:46.833
Oh, I see.

00:57:46.916 --> 00:57:47.791
-Hello.
-Peace be upon you.

00:57:47.875 --> 00:57:48.916
Peace be upon you too.

00:57:52.916 --> 00:57:56.000
HUBEI PROVINCE

00:57:56.083 --> 00:57:57.083
This is our house.

00:58:01.666 --> 00:58:02.791
Please.

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.250
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

00:58:06.875 --> 00:58:08.291
Peace be upon you.

00:58:22.666 --> 00:58:26.583
I'm happy to finally have
another woman in this house.

00:58:26.666 --> 00:58:28.333
Where's your mother?

00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:32.250
She has left us.

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:34.958
Bira, I'm so sorry.

00:58:35.875 --> 00:58:37.916
It's fine. Bira, please prepare the room.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.666
Open the window, let the fresh air in.

00:58:41.333 --> 00:58:43.125
No, you don't have to. Let me.

00:58:43.208 --> 00:58:44.833
No, let me.

00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.708
Thanks, sweetie.

00:58:46.791 --> 00:58:47.708
Have a seat.

00:58:55.083 --> 00:58:56.083
Thanks.

00:58:56.958 --> 00:58:58.208
Here's a phone.

00:58:58.291 --> 00:59:00.875
It has a SIM card and some credit in it.
You can just use it.

00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:04.041
-Mo, I'm only troubling you.
-It's okay.

00:59:04.125 --> 00:59:05.416
No, it's fine.

00:59:06.041 --> 00:59:08.500
Dad told me to give it to you. It's fine.

00:59:11.125 --> 00:59:12.083
Thanks, Mo.

00:59:12.791 --> 00:59:13.666
You're welcome.

00:59:15.708 --> 00:59:18.083
Mo, when will we go to Beijing?

00:59:18.958 --> 00:59:22.208
It takes 12 hours to go to Beijing by bus.

00:59:22.291 --> 00:59:23.250
No.

00:59:23.333 --> 00:59:26.166
I need to apply for a new passport,
so I need to get there faster.

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:27.625
Maybe by train or plane.

00:59:27.708 --> 00:59:30.125
To get on a train or a plane,
you need a passport.

00:59:30.208 --> 00:59:31.500
You're right!

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:33.250
It's Saturday.

00:59:33.333 --> 00:59:36.875
We'll depart tomorrow at night,
so we'll arrive there Monday morning.

00:59:39.666 --> 00:59:40.791
You're going with me?

00:59:42.458 --> 00:59:43.583
Yes.

00:59:43.666 --> 00:59:45.041
It's my fault.

00:59:45.125 --> 00:59:47.083
So I'll accompany you
until all of your business is resolved

00:59:47.166 --> 00:59:48.041
and you're able to go home.

00:59:48.125 --> 00:59:51.166
Mo, thank you so much,
but this isn't your fault.

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:53.583
This is my fault.

00:59:53.666 --> 00:59:56.166
You're only involved
because you were accompanying me.

00:59:57.041 --> 00:59:58.250
It's both of our faults.

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:04.125
Thanks, Mo.

01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:06.500
Aisha.

01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:08.166
The room's ready.

01:00:13.875 --> 01:00:16.291
Mo, I'm going to clean up.

01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:18.625
Okay, go ahead. Accompany her, Bira.

01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:25.666
Come in.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:29.958
If you need anything,
I'll be in the room next door.

01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:31.916
Okay. Thanks, sweetie.

01:00:32.875 --> 01:00:34.083
Enjoy your rest.

01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:54.375
Evy.

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:04.166
Pick it up, Evy.

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:15.291
Arif.

01:01:16.416 --> 01:01:17.333
Arif.

01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:44.208
Peace be upon you, Arif.

01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:49.166
Peace be upon you.

01:01:49.833 --> 01:01:51.000
Hello?

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.458
Arif?

01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:01.541
Arif, I know you can hear me.

01:02:04.958 --> 01:02:07.458
Arif, you still owe me an explanation.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.583
Arif, do you know that I'm in Ningxia?

01:02:11.666 --> 01:02:14.125
I wanted to surprise you
for your birthday.

01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:19.625
But I don't know where you are.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:21.958
Arif?

01:02:23.125 --> 01:02:25.208
I converted for you.

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:31.541
My name's Aisha now.

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:14.083
Aisha, I'm coming in, okay?

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.333
Bira.

01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:20.666
Sorry for disturbing your rest.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:22.333
I want to give you the prayer robe.

01:03:22.916 --> 01:03:24.333
Thanks, Bira.

01:03:24.416 --> 01:03:27.291
Mo and I are going
to the mosque to pray together.

01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:28.541
Do you want to come with us?

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:31.125
I think I'll stay here.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:33.666
We won't be gone for long.

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:34.916
Peace be upon you.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.291
Peace be upon you too.

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:47.666
God is the greatest.

01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:53.000
God is the greatest.

01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:58.125
God is the greatest.

01:03:58.208 --> 01:04:00.791
I bear witness that there is only one God.

01:04:00.875 --> 01:04:03.083
Sorry for being presumptuous.

01:04:03.166 --> 01:04:05.541
But who did you convert for?

01:04:06.833 --> 01:04:08.250
Ideally, you do that for God.

01:04:10.583 --> 01:04:12.791
But if there's another reason,

01:04:14.541 --> 01:04:16.458
I hope that becomes
your process to be better.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.208
Mo.

01:04:18.291 --> 01:04:19.708
You like Aisha, don't you?

01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:21.958
Bira!

01:04:29.458 --> 01:04:31.583
I'll go with you.

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:52.083
God is the greatest.

01:05:06.125 --> 01:05:07.833
God is the greatest.

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:14.583
God hears those who praise Him.

01:05:17.333 --> 01:05:19.833
God is the greatest.

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:24.750
Peace be upon you, Mo.

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:31.541
This is Aisha.

01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:34.000
She's Indonesian.

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:39.500
This is Aisha.

01:05:39.583 --> 01:05:40.500
She's Indonesian.

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:46.458
Oh, God.

01:05:47.208 --> 01:05:48.583
The Most Gracious.

01:05:49.541 --> 01:05:50.833
The Most Merciful.

01:05:52.875 --> 01:05:54.208
Oh, God.

01:05:54.291 --> 01:05:56.666
Make all of my matters easy.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.875
Help me strengthen my Islamic faith.

01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:08.666
Grant me Your help and guidance,
so that I do not lose my way.

01:06:09.708 --> 01:06:12.458
So I do not walk without Your guidance.

01:06:14.166 --> 01:06:15.791
Peace be upon you.

01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:16.916
Dad.

01:06:18.333 --> 01:06:19.291
Peace be upon you.

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:20.500
Baba.

01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:22.708
I'm going home, okay?

01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:25.750
Who knows the meaning
of "Bismillahirrahmanirrahim"?

01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:26.791
I know.

01:06:27.666 --> 01:06:30.250
In the name of God, the Most Gracious
and the Most Merciful.

01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:31.583
Correct!

01:06:31.666 --> 01:06:32.750
-Very good.
-Right.

01:06:33.666 --> 01:06:34.500
This is for you.

01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:35.458
Praise be to God.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.375
Despite the appearance, he's an ustadz.

01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:42.500
Why "despite the appearance"?

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:44.625
Who knows the meaning
of "Lailahaillallah"?

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:45.583
I know.

01:06:46.458 --> 01:06:50.125
I bear witness that there is only one God.

01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:51.458
Very correct!

01:06:53.708 --> 01:06:54.791
This is for you.

01:06:54.875 --> 01:06:56.250
Praise be to God.

01:07:01.666 --> 01:07:03.916
Your brother is suitable as an ustadz.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.666
He's sincere.

01:07:06.916 --> 01:07:07.916
Good-looking.

01:07:08.833 --> 01:07:10.333
Do you like him?

01:07:10.416 --> 01:07:13.208
I do, but as a best friend.

01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:14.500
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:18.750
Didn't Mo tell you?

01:07:20.333 --> 01:07:22.791
He never tells me anything.
He doesn't gossip.

01:07:22.875 --> 01:07:24.500
I am really curious.

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:26.791
Why didn't you go back with your friends?

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:29.333
Why did you meet him instead?

01:07:29.416 --> 01:07:31.000
But he didn't answer me.

01:07:31.791 --> 01:07:32.916
Well…

01:07:34.875 --> 01:07:36.833
-Maybe it's a fate.
-Amen.

01:07:38.666 --> 01:07:40.000
-Why amen?
-Amen.

01:07:40.083 --> 01:07:43.083
I hope Mo and you are destined
to be together.

01:07:43.166 --> 01:07:44.458
Amen.

01:07:44.541 --> 01:07:46.625
But he has a lot of girlfriends.

01:08:01.833 --> 01:08:04.375
We depart earlier
because I have something to do.

01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:07.333
After that, we'll take a tour of the town.

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:09.416
You're going to meet
your sweet girlfriends, aren't you?

01:08:11.208 --> 01:08:13.625
That explains why you won't
let me sit in the front seat.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.666
Are you worried that they'll get jealous?

01:08:30.958 --> 01:08:32.750
Aisha, you can come with me.

01:08:32.833 --> 01:08:34.708
No, I don't want to disturb you.

01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:37.500
You won't. With you,
I'll have a reason to be quick.

01:08:38.083 --> 01:08:39.250
Let's go.

01:08:39.333 --> 01:08:41.416
Okay, then. Let me help you. Hang on.

01:08:42.666 --> 01:08:43.666
Hang on.

01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:48.041
Take these.

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:49.083
Okay.

01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:50.000
Yeah.

01:08:51.208 --> 01:08:53.000
Let me carry that.

01:08:53.083 --> 01:08:54.166
It's fine.

01:08:56.416 --> 01:08:58.291
Are you worried that
your girlfriends will get jealous?

01:08:59.333 --> 01:09:01.958
They're used to seeing me
with other women.

01:09:02.041 --> 01:09:03.250
They even support each other.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:08.833
Are you going to marry
all of your girlfriends?

01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:11.125
You know, as a new convert,

01:09:11.208 --> 01:09:15.208
men like you give Islam a bad name.

01:09:15.833 --> 01:09:18.208
But we're allowed to have four wives.

01:09:18.291 --> 01:09:19.916
But it's not an obligation.

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:23.458
Let's go.

01:09:30.208 --> 01:09:31.291
Peace be with you.

01:09:32.166 --> 01:09:34.083
You're finally here.

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:38.791
-Be careful.
-I miss you.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.583
Sorry, I've been busy.

01:09:40.666 --> 01:09:42.458
I miss you.

01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:44.291
-Granny, how are you?
-I'm fine.

01:09:44.375 --> 01:09:45.541
Good.

01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:48.208
Aisha, meet one of my girlfriends.

01:09:48.916 --> 01:09:50.833
I brought you a little bit of food.

01:09:50.916 --> 01:09:52.833
-Just put it there.
-Okay.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:10:00.083
Is this your fiancée?

01:10:00.166 --> 01:10:02.125
-If God's willing.
-Thank God.

01:10:02.916 --> 01:10:03.958
What's going on?

01:10:04.041 --> 01:10:05.083
Good.

01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:08.375
She asked me if you're my future wife.

01:10:10.333 --> 01:10:11.375
If God's willing?

01:10:13.958 --> 01:10:15.333
So beautiful.

01:10:16.916 --> 01:10:19.833
Mo, why did you answer "if God's willing"?

01:10:22.583 --> 01:10:24.833
I don't want to precede God
by saying "no."

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.625
We never know
what will happen in the future.

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:29.833
That's why I said that.

01:10:31.875 --> 01:10:33.416
Mo, you finally come.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:34.416
Granny.

01:10:36.958 --> 01:10:38.500
Come and sit here.

01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:43.875
Let me change it for you.

01:10:45.416 --> 01:10:47.000
-Thank you.
-Mo, I can do that.

01:10:49.083 --> 01:10:50.166
Seriously?

01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:54.541
-Is that okay?
-Thank you.

01:10:59.291 --> 01:11:01.000
Your girlfriends are funny.

01:11:01.708 --> 01:11:03.125
Thank you for helping.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.375
A mother is a child's first educator.

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:11.708
She's usually here.

01:11:14.208 --> 01:11:15.791
How adorable!

01:11:15.875 --> 01:11:17.541
-Granny.
-Hi!

01:11:17.625 --> 01:11:19.666
-Hi.
-I brought cat food.

01:11:30.583 --> 01:11:32.666
Hi, Mo!

01:11:37.125 --> 01:11:38.541
These are your belongings.

01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:39.750
Thank you.

01:11:42.625 --> 01:11:45.125
There's a lot of stuff.

01:11:45.208 --> 01:11:46.291
Thank you, Mo.

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:48.375
This is my most spoiled girlfriend.

01:11:49.458 --> 01:11:50.958
I still have a lot more girlfriends.

01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:52.541
If we have time, we'll meet them.

01:11:54.166 --> 01:11:56.833
May I ask why you are doing this?

01:11:58.416 --> 01:12:01.083
They remind me of my mother.

01:12:04.541 --> 01:12:07.541
Mo is a good boy.

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:11.500
Sorry for my negative assumption earlier.

01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:14.125
I thought you really had
a lot of girlfriends.

01:12:14.708 --> 01:12:16.000
But you weren't jealous, were you?

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:18.041
No.

01:12:18.583 --> 01:12:19.500
I'm only kidding.

01:12:20.666 --> 01:12:22.041
Where do you want to go now?

01:12:22.125 --> 01:12:23.458
Still want to look for your boyfriend?

01:12:26.291 --> 01:12:30.541
I decided not to look for Arif for now.

01:12:31.916 --> 01:12:33.958
I want to get closer to God.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.125
Praise be to God.

01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:38.500
Granny.

01:12:38.583 --> 01:12:40.000
I'll take you home, okay?

01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:41.875
Thank you for taking me home.

01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:39.208
How should I pose, Mo?

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:41.500
Look over there.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:42.416
Over there?

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.583
Yes. One, two, three.

01:13:47.708 --> 01:13:50.000
Mo, I want to…

01:13:50.083 --> 01:13:51.083
Aisha!

01:13:58.916 --> 01:14:00.583
Don't look back again, okay?

01:14:02.625 --> 01:14:04.125
From now on, just look ahead.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Sorry

01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:16.208
for being presumptuous.

01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:18.458
I didn't mean anything by doing that.

01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:21.083
It's okay.

01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:23.333
I just wanted to calm you down. Sorry.

01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:25.416
It's okay, Mo. Relax.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:28.291
I actually want to thank you

01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:30.541
for always trying to calm me down.

01:14:32.875 --> 01:14:33.958
Hang on.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:36.833
Hello?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.583
Right.

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:42.416
Okay.

01:14:43.375 --> 01:14:44.250
Okay.

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:45.791
Thank you.

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:48.541
Our prayers have been answered.

01:14:50.458 --> 01:14:51.666
What?

01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:55.250
Hello. Here's your bag.
Please check if anything's missing.

01:14:55.333 --> 01:14:57.291
Okay. Check your stuff first.

01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:58.208
-See if everything's there.
-Okay.

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:05.166
This one…

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:09.250
Passport, phone. Hold on.

01:15:10.916 --> 01:15:12.041
Everything's here!

01:15:14.083 --> 01:15:15.291
Thank you so much.

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:16.791
Thank you.

01:15:16.875 --> 01:15:18.541
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:15:18.625 --> 01:15:20.541
Thank you.
All of her stuff is still in it.

01:15:20.625 --> 01:15:21.458
Thank you.

01:15:21.541 --> 01:15:22.416
All her stuff is still in there.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.291
We found the bag in a car
that was involved in an accident.

01:15:25.375 --> 01:15:26.916
Please be careful next time.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.041
Okay.

01:15:28.125 --> 01:15:30.708
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:35.458
Praise be to God.

01:15:35.541 --> 01:15:37.625
-Mo, thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

01:15:42.416 --> 01:15:44.083
-I'm fine.
-It's okay.

01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:49.500
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:15:55.041 --> 01:15:58.541
Mo, give me the bill for your car rental.

01:15:58.625 --> 01:15:59.583
I'm going to pay you now.

01:16:00.333 --> 01:16:02.083
It's been paid in full.

01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:03.958
I haven't paid it.

01:16:05.375 --> 01:16:06.333
This.

01:16:07.458 --> 01:16:08.791
The coin you tossed.

01:16:09.958 --> 01:16:11.416
It's enough to pay for my service.

01:16:15.416 --> 01:16:17.083
Mo, stop joking around.

01:16:17.166 --> 01:16:18.375
I'm serious.

01:16:18.458 --> 01:16:21.041
We had an agreement. It's muamalah.

01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:24.916
"Muamalah"? What does that mean?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.125
It's a mutual agreement.

01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:30.583
If God's willing, He will forgive us
for any shortcomings.

01:16:30.666 --> 01:16:31.541
Okay.

01:16:31.625 --> 01:16:34.708
But that's only one yuan,
so there's no way it's enough.

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:36.708
But it's very valuable to me.

01:16:40.333 --> 01:16:41.541
Okay, then. We're going, okay?

01:16:45.416 --> 01:16:47.291
Are you going back soon?

01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:49.541
Aisha?

01:16:49.625 --> 01:16:51.208
Peace be upon you.

01:16:51.833 --> 01:16:54.583
-Peace be upon you too.
-Peace be upon you too.

01:16:55.416 --> 01:16:56.833
Evy!

01:16:56.916 --> 01:16:58.875
Aisha! Oh, God!

01:16:59.625 --> 01:17:02.500
Why didn't you tell me that
you still have a problem here?

01:17:02.583 --> 01:17:04.416
I don't want to burden you.

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.541
Even so, you're still on my mind.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.625
Hug me.

01:17:10.333 --> 01:17:11.208
Me too, Evy.

01:17:13.708 --> 01:17:14.875
I'll hug Mo, then.

01:17:15.583 --> 01:17:16.708
-Come here.
-Thank you, Mo.

01:17:16.791 --> 01:17:18.208
Let's drink some tea.

01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:19.583
Baba.

01:17:22.291 --> 01:17:26.166
I have a little souvenir for you.

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:27.666
Praise be to God.

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:29.458
And this is for Bira.

01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:31.000
Thank you, Aisha.

01:17:31.083 --> 01:17:35.958
Aisha, you don't need to give this to me.

01:17:36.958 --> 01:17:40.041
It's nothing compared
to the help you gave me.

01:17:41.208 --> 01:17:42.250
You're welcome.

01:17:45.458 --> 01:17:46.541
Bira?

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:48.666
What's the matter?
Don't you like the gift?

01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:50.041
I like it.

01:17:50.125 --> 01:17:52.708
I'm just sad that you'll be leaving soon.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.416
I promise you

01:17:55.958 --> 01:17:57.625
when you come to Jakarta,

01:17:57.708 --> 01:18:00.541
I'll accompany you
anywhere you want to go.

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:01.791
Me too.

01:18:01.875 --> 01:18:03.458
And I, Victor, will drive.

01:18:11.625 --> 01:18:13.500
Sorry, but I have to study.

01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:29.708
I'm going to my room.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:33.166
Aisha.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.208
Mo.

01:18:35.333 --> 01:18:36.291
Did I say something wrong?

01:18:36.375 --> 01:18:37.458
Mo, forgive us.

01:18:37.541 --> 01:18:39.500
It's nothing.

01:18:39.583 --> 01:18:40.750
Mo, I'm serious.

01:18:40.833 --> 01:18:43.250
Do you want more tea? Or coffee? Anything?

01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:46.291
Seriously, the look
on their faces instantly changed.

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:53.333
It's a sensitive subject here
in this house

01:18:53.416 --> 01:18:55.375
when it comes to going back to Indonesia.

01:18:56.875 --> 01:18:57.833
Why?

01:18:57.916 --> 01:18:59.500
I will tell you everything.

01:19:08.541 --> 01:19:09.583
I…

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.166
used to have a happy family.

01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:15.666
We lived a comfortable life.

01:19:17.375 --> 01:19:18.458
But one day,

01:19:19.041 --> 01:19:20.541
something happened.

01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:24.208
Everything changed drastically.

01:19:24.291 --> 01:19:25.750
My business collapsed.

01:19:27.041 --> 01:19:28.583
I lost my possessions.

01:19:31.208 --> 01:19:33.083
My second child died

01:19:35.125 --> 01:19:37.666
because I couldn't take her to the doctor.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.958
Losing a child

01:19:41.958 --> 01:19:43.541
devastated me.

01:19:44.208 --> 01:19:45.500
I was heartbroken.

01:19:47.375 --> 01:19:49.083
I hated this world.

01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:52.791
I thought God wasn't fair.

01:19:54.708 --> 01:19:56.791
I ended up addicted to alcohol.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.083
I got drunk almost every day.

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:05.416
I abandoned Mohammad and Bira.

01:20:06.375 --> 01:20:07.375
One night,

01:20:08.291 --> 01:20:09.583
when I was drunk,

01:20:10.458 --> 01:20:12.291
I got hit by a car

01:20:12.833 --> 01:20:14.833
and I was in a coma for almost a month.

01:20:15.875 --> 01:20:17.791
Not even one relative was aware of it.

01:20:17.875 --> 01:20:23.000
I left Mohammad and Bira locked
in the house.

01:20:28.708 --> 01:20:30.000
After I regained consciousness,

01:20:30.583 --> 01:20:32.541
when I came home,

01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:35.458
I couldn't find my kids.

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:38.708
I was worried.

01:20:39.291 --> 01:20:40.416
I was terrified.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.583
I was afraid of losing my kids.

01:20:46.666 --> 01:20:48.500
Mohammad and Bira

01:20:49.166 --> 01:20:51.583
are the most valuable things
I have in my life.

01:20:54.375 --> 01:20:57.166
Turns out, they were well looked after

01:20:58.041 --> 01:21:01.208
by our Muslim neighbors
that I hated before.

01:21:02.333 --> 01:21:03.750
Their kindness

01:21:07.041 --> 01:21:08.916
made me feel ashamed.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.458
I realized

01:21:13.666 --> 01:21:15.958
I had misjudged Islam.

01:21:20.291 --> 01:21:22.750
I decided to convert to Islam

01:21:22.833 --> 01:21:26.125
and brought Mohammad and Bira here.

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:30.875
Now, you can share my story

01:21:31.958 --> 01:21:34.083
in the hope that
it will be useful to many.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.833
Why don't you tell us about Mom?

01:21:39.916 --> 01:21:41.833
It's time for you to tell everything.

01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:45.625
I'm tired of keeping everything to myself.

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:50.291
It's not easy to lie to Bira every day,
telling her that our mom has died.

01:21:50.375 --> 01:21:51.708
Mom is alive?

01:21:56.458 --> 01:21:58.000
Mom is alive?

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:01.541
Why did you lie to me?

01:22:03.208 --> 01:22:04.833
I've been lied to!

01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:08.250
-You've been lying to me!
-Bira.

01:22:08.333 --> 01:22:12.500
I always wonder why you're rarely home

01:22:12.583 --> 01:22:14.458
and always have problems with the police.

01:22:14.541 --> 01:22:16.083
Is it to avoid me?

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:19.000
Is it because of me?

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:21.208
You've been lying to me.

01:22:21.291 --> 01:22:23.333
You're all I have.

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.333
You've been lying to me.

01:22:27.416 --> 01:22:30.458
Why are you lying?

01:22:30.541 --> 01:22:33.166
Bira, it's not that
I don't want to tell you.

01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:35.041
I'm just waiting for the right time.

01:22:35.125 --> 01:22:39.875
One day, with or without you,
I will find her!

01:22:45.958 --> 01:22:47.166
Apologize to her.

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:48.583
Apologize!

01:22:50.291 --> 01:22:51.958
And you have to be able to forgive her

01:22:52.833 --> 01:22:54.458
who left us for another man.

01:23:55.291 --> 01:23:57.416
Sorry for making you uncomfortable
with our issues.

01:24:00.416 --> 01:24:02.250
Maybe this is our only chance

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:06.208
to deal with our family problems.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:09.333
Actually, I didn't realize
that you're very tough.

01:24:13.208 --> 01:24:16.000
You hid a big secret

01:24:18.708 --> 01:24:20.000
from Saabira.

01:24:22.541 --> 01:24:28.958
I also know that you hurt yourself
to vent all the pain in your heart.

01:24:43.916 --> 01:24:46.416
I just want to say that I admire you.

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.958
You're very strong.

01:24:51.916 --> 01:24:53.000
Back then,

01:24:55.125 --> 01:24:58.208
when my parents left me,

01:25:00.916 --> 01:25:04.750
I still needed them very much.

01:25:08.166 --> 01:25:10.958
But they only left me with sadness.

01:25:14.041 --> 01:25:15.291
In your case,

01:25:17.333 --> 01:25:19.500
your mom left you with pain.

01:25:20.208 --> 01:25:21.291
It takes time

01:25:24.666 --> 01:25:26.958
to make peace with ourselves
and forgive ourselves.

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:32.791
And you know it must've been hard for you.

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.875
You've grown into a good person.

01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:41.375
You're a good son to Baba.

01:25:43.333 --> 01:25:45.750
A brother that Saabira can be proud of.

01:25:46.791 --> 01:25:50.458
Your family history
won't destroy your future, Mo.

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.291
No one is perfect.

01:25:56.458 --> 01:25:58.833
No family is perfect.

01:26:15.791 --> 01:26:17.166
Mohammad.

01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:18.291
It turns out

01:26:19.625 --> 01:26:22.500
you're more mature than I thought.

01:26:24.333 --> 01:26:26.125
I'm sorry

01:26:26.916 --> 01:26:29.875
for making you feel very stressed.

01:26:30.958 --> 01:26:33.291
I also need to apologize to you, Bira.

01:26:51.583 --> 01:26:55.333
I promise I will bring you to Jakarta soon

01:26:55.416 --> 01:26:57.250
to meet your mom.

01:26:59.041 --> 01:27:01.791
I miss Indonesia too.

01:27:05.125 --> 01:27:06.166
Bira.

01:27:06.708 --> 01:27:08.291
Forgive me.

01:28:10.916 --> 01:28:16.291
HUBEI PROVINCE

01:28:18.458 --> 01:28:19.416
Wait a second.

01:28:24.958 --> 01:28:25.833
Peace be upon you.

01:28:26.375 --> 01:28:27.291
Peace be upon you too.

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:29.375
I'm Arif.

01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:31.666
Mo.

01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:33.416
Don't be surprised seeing me here.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:37.791
Not a lot of Indonesians in the area
and everyone knows your dad's restaurant.

01:28:38.916 --> 01:28:39.875
What business do you have here?

01:28:39.958 --> 01:28:41.333
I need to talk to Aisha.

01:28:44.625 --> 01:28:48.375
Sorry. I don't think it's a good idea
for you two to meet.

01:28:48.458 --> 01:28:49.708
You'd better go.

01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:51.500
Why? Who are you to her anyway?

01:28:59.666 --> 01:29:00.625
Arif.

01:29:05.416 --> 01:29:07.625
Can we talk privately?

01:29:08.416 --> 01:29:09.291
Aisha?

01:29:20.166 --> 01:29:21.166
How are you?

01:29:21.250 --> 01:29:22.791
How are you doing?

01:29:24.333 --> 01:29:25.750
How are your studies?

01:29:27.041 --> 01:29:28.250
How's your apartment?

01:29:28.875 --> 01:29:31.208
How's all your lies?

01:29:33.208 --> 01:29:34.791
I had to quit my studies

01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:38.458
to take care of my sick mom
whose medication is costly.

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:44.208
I know I'm in the wrong.
I lied about my studies.

01:29:44.291 --> 01:29:45.875
I lied about my apartment.

01:29:45.958 --> 01:29:48.250
But that's all I lied about, Aisha.

01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:52.125
Everything else is true,
about me loving you.

01:29:52.666 --> 01:29:53.833
I heard you.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.833
All that you said on the phone.

01:30:02.125 --> 01:30:03.583
So why didn't you say something?

01:30:08.833 --> 01:30:10.250
Because I was ashamed.

01:30:10.791 --> 01:30:12.291
I used the money you sent for my studies

01:30:12.375 --> 01:30:14.125
to pay for my mom's medication.

01:30:17.291 --> 01:30:18.416
I was afraid.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.041
Afraid of losing you.

01:30:21.666 --> 01:30:23.041
I'm afraid that you would think

01:30:27.166 --> 01:30:29.416
that I'm not the person
you could be proud of anymore.

01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:33.541
How is she now?

01:30:34.625 --> 01:30:35.791
She's fine now.

01:30:35.875 --> 01:30:38.500
So, why did you keep avoiding me?

01:30:39.083 --> 01:30:40.833
Why did you never tell me about it?

01:30:49.708 --> 01:30:51.000
Do you have another girlfriend?

01:30:55.875 --> 01:30:59.333
There's no other woman
in my heart but you, Aisha.

01:30:59.958 --> 01:31:00.958
There's no way.

01:31:01.041 --> 01:31:03.583
I did lie to you,
but I really was taking care of my mom.

01:31:03.666 --> 01:31:06.041
I know I did you wrong, and I'm sorry.

01:31:10.666 --> 01:31:11.916
I need time.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.041
I know this must be hard for you.

01:31:16.916 --> 01:31:18.333
I know this isn't fair.

01:31:18.416 --> 01:31:20.791
Take all the time you need to forgive me.

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.083
I'll wait

01:31:22.166 --> 01:31:24.333
until you're ready to forgive me.

01:31:25.625 --> 01:31:26.875
I promise, Aisha.

01:31:28.666 --> 01:31:32.208
I will try to be the best for you.

01:31:33.166 --> 01:31:34.500
If God's willing.

01:31:39.166 --> 01:31:40.208
Arif.

01:31:44.875 --> 01:31:47.708
How can I trust you again?

01:31:47.791 --> 01:31:51.541
GOD IS THE GREATEST

01:31:51.625 --> 01:31:56.416
GOD IS THE GREATEST

01:31:59.416 --> 01:32:01.250
I will go back to Jakarta with you.

01:32:02.125 --> 01:32:03.458
When you called me,

01:32:03.541 --> 01:32:05.916
I just realized that
I don't know a lot about you.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.958
But there are also some things
you don't know about me.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.083
I've kept this for a while.

01:32:12.708 --> 01:32:14.625
GOD IS THE GREATEST

01:32:19.541 --> 01:32:21.250
In the name of God.

01:32:24.708 --> 01:32:25.750
Aisha.

01:32:28.291 --> 01:32:31.125
Would you like to be my life partner?

01:32:54.916 --> 01:32:56.666
I know I made a mistake.

01:32:56.750 --> 01:33:00.708
I promise I won't repeat my mistake.

01:33:01.791 --> 01:33:02.708
Forgive me.

01:33:04.833 --> 01:33:06.208
Forgive me.

01:33:33.166 --> 01:33:35.833
Aisha, you can't just believe him.

01:33:35.916 --> 01:33:37.916
Don't rush your decision.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.041
I'm still mad at him.

01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:43.166
Yet you reconcile with him. So, whatever.

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:45.166
If you're already upset over this,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
how do you think Mo feels?

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:49.875
I'm upset too.

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.583
What do you think, Mo?

01:33:54.875 --> 01:33:56.375
My job as the driver

01:33:56.458 --> 01:34:00.791
who helped Aisha find
what she was looking for is done.

01:34:02.333 --> 01:34:04.625
She has found what she was looking for.

01:34:05.625 --> 01:34:08.000
So, she knows better
what she needs to decide.

01:34:14.166 --> 01:34:15.666
Let's continue eating.

01:34:19.291 --> 01:34:22.875
Aisha, please rethink your decision
to reconcile with Arif.

01:34:22.958 --> 01:34:26.666
I think Mo deserves a chance
more than that depraved man.

01:34:30.583 --> 01:34:31.416
Evy.

01:34:33.125 --> 01:34:37.250
First, I'm not done with Arif.

01:34:38.791 --> 01:34:39.875
Secondly,

01:34:41.708 --> 01:34:43.791
Mo was with me

01:34:44.708 --> 01:34:48.500
only because he wanted
to help fellow Muslims.

01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:51.083
That's all.

01:34:53.541 --> 01:34:55.708
Aisha. Listen to me.

01:34:55.791 --> 01:34:58.916
Mo has feelings for you.
He cares a lot about you.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.583
Trust me.

01:35:02.458 --> 01:35:03.625
Stop it, Evy.

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:07.458
Enough.

01:35:07.541 --> 01:35:09.958
We're going back to Indonesia.

01:35:10.916 --> 01:35:14.208
Please don't add to my burden, okay?

01:35:14.291 --> 01:35:17.916
Actually, I can't accept Aisha
and Arif being together.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.416
I prefer her being with you.

01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:23.750
With you, she's smiling from ear to ear.

01:35:24.375 --> 01:35:25.958
How do you know that?

01:35:26.583 --> 01:35:27.750
She chose Arif,

01:35:28.291 --> 01:35:29.958
and she's happy with her decision.

01:35:30.041 --> 01:35:32.458
I'm happy if she's happy.

01:35:34.375 --> 01:35:36.291
That sounds like something
right out of a novel.

01:35:36.375 --> 01:35:38.666
Easy to read but suffocating, right?

01:35:42.208 --> 01:35:43.833
Aisha has made her decision

01:35:43.916 --> 01:35:45.166
and we have to respect that.

01:35:46.041 --> 01:35:46.916
Wait.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.625
Be honest, from the bottom of your heart,

01:35:50.416 --> 01:35:52.041
you have feelings for Aisha, right?

01:35:54.333 --> 01:35:57.625
Baba, thank you so much.
We're so happy here.

01:35:57.708 --> 01:35:59.708
The food is great,
the place is comfortable.

01:35:59.791 --> 01:36:01.500
Aisha is also happy, right?

01:36:02.416 --> 01:36:04.458
You're welcome, Evy.

01:36:04.541 --> 01:36:05.750
Have you brought everything?

01:36:05.833 --> 01:36:07.291
-All of your stuff is in the car.
-Yes.

01:36:07.375 --> 01:36:09.125
-Let's go.
-Now, we only have to depart.

01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:12.166
Baba, I'm leaving.

01:36:14.875 --> 01:36:17.416
Baba, thank you so much for helping me.

01:36:17.958 --> 01:36:20.041
And I'm so sorry for troubling you.

01:36:20.125 --> 01:36:21.166
You're welcome, Aisha.

01:36:21.250 --> 01:36:22.625
Have a safe journey.

01:36:23.583 --> 01:36:26.083
I will find you when I go to Jakarta.

01:36:26.166 --> 01:36:28.375
I'll be waiting for you in Jakarta.

01:36:30.583 --> 01:36:32.250
Be good here, Bira.

01:36:36.333 --> 01:36:38.500
Bira, I promise you

01:36:39.458 --> 01:36:41.708
we'll go to Indonesia
for a holiday this year.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:49.583
I know Mo is happy too.
He wants to meet you again soon.

01:36:52.416 --> 01:36:54.708
We're leaving, Baba. Thank you so much.

01:36:54.791 --> 01:36:56.666
-Yes. Take care.
-Okay.

01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:57.750
Peace be upon you.

01:36:57.833 --> 01:36:59.125
Peace be upon you too.

01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:00.875
Peace be upon you.

01:37:00.958 --> 01:37:02.083
Peace be upon you too.

01:37:25.208 --> 01:37:27.291
It's so quiet, like at a cemetery.

01:37:27.916 --> 01:37:29.125
I know.

01:37:29.666 --> 01:37:31.375
It must be hard.

01:37:32.625 --> 01:37:36.166
Being left behind and leaving Ningxia
with all its memories.

01:39:04.833 --> 01:39:06.250
I miss chilli sauce, Evy.

01:39:06.333 --> 01:39:07.458
Me too.

01:39:08.333 --> 01:39:09.541
Thank you, Mo.

01:39:12.916 --> 01:39:14.583
You're welcome, Aisha.

01:39:16.541 --> 01:39:20.916
I will never forget everything
we've been through.

01:39:22.916 --> 01:39:24.708
I'll never be able to forget it too.

01:39:24.791 --> 01:39:25.875
Aisha!

01:39:31.125 --> 01:39:32.833
I'm going to talk to Arif
for a second, okay?

01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:36.333
Arif.

01:39:39.083 --> 01:39:41.166
I saw you with a girl at the City Wall.

01:39:42.666 --> 01:39:44.083
I also went to your apartment

01:39:44.166 --> 01:39:46.166
and got a lot of information about you.

01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:47.333
What is he doing?

01:39:48.166 --> 01:39:50.125
He said he wanted to talk for a second.

01:39:56.291 --> 01:39:59.416
You betrayed Aisha
by living with someone else.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.666
I think Aisha must know about this.

01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:03.333
Mo, please.

01:40:04.625 --> 01:40:05.791
Aisha…

01:40:05.875 --> 01:40:07.916
She's already been hurt enough.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.166
No need to add to it.

01:40:09.250 --> 01:40:11.416
I promise I'll be loyal to her.

01:40:12.375 --> 01:40:15.250
Being apart from her made me realize
that I really love her.

01:40:15.333 --> 01:40:16.458
It's true.

01:40:16.541 --> 01:40:20.333
Please. Please give me a chance
to make her happy.

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:23.958
For God's sake.

01:40:24.041 --> 01:40:25.625
For God's sake, I've changed.

01:40:26.291 --> 01:40:27.125
I promise.

01:40:37.666 --> 01:40:38.708
Let's go.

01:40:39.541 --> 01:40:40.375
Come on.

01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:45.125
Arif!

01:40:45.833 --> 01:40:46.750
Arif!

01:40:51.250 --> 01:40:52.291
You're running away?

01:40:52.375 --> 01:40:54.250
You're going to leave me
in this situation?

01:40:54.333 --> 01:40:55.708
-What are you doing here?
-Isn't that…

01:40:55.791 --> 01:40:56.958
-We're no longer in a relationship.
-No.

01:40:57.041 --> 01:40:59.083
-You have to take responsibility for this.
-I need to go back to Jakarta!

01:40:59.166 --> 01:41:01.166
We're done here! Got it?

01:41:08.333 --> 01:41:09.458
Do you know?

01:41:09.541 --> 01:41:11.000
When you went to the apartment that day,

01:41:11.083 --> 01:41:12.625
Arif was there.

01:41:12.708 --> 01:41:14.500
He called his friend who lives next door

01:41:14.583 --> 01:41:16.250
to pretend to be my husband.

01:41:16.333 --> 01:41:18.125
When we went to the apartment,

01:41:18.708 --> 01:41:19.666
Arif was there.

01:41:20.291 --> 01:41:22.458
He asked her to lie.

01:41:22.541 --> 01:41:26.250
He asked her to say that
her male friend is her husband.

01:41:26.333 --> 01:41:27.916
She's lying.

01:41:28.833 --> 01:41:30.541
She's lying, Aisha! It's a slander.

01:41:30.625 --> 01:41:32.833
I rejected her advances.
That's why she slanders me.

01:41:32.916 --> 01:41:35.750
Did he also tell you his mom was sick?

01:41:35.833 --> 01:41:38.083
He told me the same thing a year ago.

01:41:38.166 --> 01:41:40.333
But the truth is,
he's been lying to us all along.

01:41:40.416 --> 01:41:43.041
Did Arif tell you about her sick mom?

01:41:43.125 --> 01:41:43.958
Yes.

01:41:44.041 --> 01:41:47.750
He told you that story
to make you pity him.

01:41:47.833 --> 01:41:49.166
Aisha, he's a liar.

01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:51.333
And this girl is pregnant,

01:41:51.416 --> 01:41:52.916
but he doesn't want
to take responsibility.

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:55.791
Honey.

01:41:55.875 --> 01:41:56.833
Aisha, you know me.

01:41:56.916 --> 01:41:58.250
Arif!

01:42:00.208 --> 01:42:03.750
How could you ask me
for money for your studies?

01:42:06.208 --> 01:42:07.375
For the apartment?

01:42:09.666 --> 01:42:11.791
You lied about your mom's condition.

01:42:13.333 --> 01:42:15.875
Now, you've gotten her pregnant
and you won't even take responsibility.

01:42:15.958 --> 01:42:17.916
You want to go back to Indonesia?

01:42:18.458 --> 01:42:19.583
How could you?

01:42:21.250 --> 01:42:22.958
You have no heart or sense.

01:42:24.125 --> 01:42:25.083
Aisha!

01:42:25.166 --> 01:42:26.500
-Enough, Arif.
-Aisha!

01:42:26.583 --> 01:42:28.541
God has shown us who you really are.

01:42:31.416 --> 01:42:34.000
Mo! Enough!

01:42:34.083 --> 01:42:35.208
Don't get any more trouble.

01:42:35.291 --> 01:42:37.833
-What are you doing?
-This man's a bad guy.

01:42:37.916 --> 01:42:39.583
-Arrest him.
-Let me go!

01:42:39.666 --> 01:42:40.583
Let me go!

01:42:40.666 --> 01:42:42.041
Arrest him!

01:43:18.375 --> 01:43:19.458
You're here, Aisha.

01:43:21.208 --> 01:43:22.166
Can you put it up?

01:43:29.250 --> 01:43:30.500
We're here, Evy.

01:43:30.583 --> 01:43:31.458
Okay.

01:43:33.291 --> 01:43:34.541
Let me put this up first.

01:43:38.083 --> 01:43:39.041
Okay.

01:44:06.375 --> 01:44:07.333
Mo.

01:44:09.416 --> 01:44:10.458
Thank you.

01:44:10.541 --> 01:44:11.375
You're welcome.

01:44:14.083 --> 01:44:16.041
Mo, the train is leaving soon.

01:44:21.333 --> 01:44:23.041
TRAIN TICKET FROM NINGXIA TO BEIJING
NAME: MO…

01:44:27.125 --> 01:44:30.125
I want to complete my job
of taking you to your destination.

01:44:48.250 --> 01:44:49.083
Mo.

01:44:49.791 --> 01:44:51.208
Call me "Mohammad."

01:44:53.041 --> 01:44:54.125
Aisha.
