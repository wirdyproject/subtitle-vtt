WEBVTT

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:36.750
They say,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.875
joy comes after suffering.

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:18.875
O Allah.

00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:22.708
Why have you given me a trial

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:25.833
greater than I can bear?

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:30.583
Why, Allah?

00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:34.583
Why?

00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:40.916
Why?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.500
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:44.458
Miss, don't do it!

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:14.708
Come on.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.625
What's the matter?

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:25.625
It's nothing, Mom.

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:27.916
Just a slight headache.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.250
And feeling nauseous.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.166
I guess I'm just tired.

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.000
Since when?

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:39.791
It's been a few days.

00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:42.375
Maybe you're pregnant.

00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:47.208
How about a pregnancy test?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.333
I'll go with you tomorrow.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.125
Amira.

00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:58.083
Don't lose hope.

00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:00.458
Maybe it's happening.

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:09.833
If you're not,

00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:12.083
well…

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:13.958
keep trying.

00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:16.666
Don't give up.

00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:20.791
And pray.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.458
I always pray, Mom.

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:26.916
It just hasn't happened yet.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:31.125
-Don't doubt Allah's plan.
-I don't.

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.291
Go to Baitullah.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:42.541
Let's go.

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:44.208
Let's visit Baitullah.

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:48.791
At the Kaaba, every prayer is granted.

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:59.125
I miss Baitullah.

00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:04.208
I wish to go back there.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.458
You have to get better then,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.458
so we can go there together.

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:16.416
Amen.

00:04:18.916 --> 00:04:21.791
Speaking of Baitullah, I just remembered,

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:25.125
can you please look for my umrah sandals?

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:28.375
-The ones we used to visit the grave?
-Yeah.

00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:30.708
-I think I left them at your place.
-Okay.

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.583
I'll check. I should get going, Mom.

00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:34.708
Okay.

00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:41.750
Stop by again tomorrow.
We'll go see the doctor together.

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:45.083
Peace be upon you.

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:47.416
And upon you peace.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.458
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you peace, honey.

00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:55.500
You're still awake?

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:58.958
How can I sleep when you're not home yet?

00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:01.375
-You must be so tired.
-Exhausted.

00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:05.958
The project in Bogor
was supposed to finish next week,

00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:07.458
but it's likely delayed.

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:12.458
The Serpong one has started,
but the client keeps requesting changes.

00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:17.333
I thought the one in Serpong
is still under negotiation.

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:18.375
It's started,

00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:21.958
but too many people are involved,
everyone wants something different.

00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:27.125
Honey,

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:33.416
I hope everything goes well.
May Allah help you.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.500
Amen.

00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:37.708
I'm going to shower. I'm beat.

00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:40.416
Honey…

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.666
When are we seeing the doctor?

00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:49.708
We can arrange it later.
I need to shower first.

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:16.666
Honey.

00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:19.458
Breakfast is almost ready.

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:24.416
Honey.

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:17.833
Don't worry. I'm leaving in a bit.

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:19.666
Okay.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.416
Honey.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.458
Whose is this?

00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:32.208
Oh, my. That's Farida's.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:33.875
I didn't tell you?

00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:37.750
She wants to start
an online underwear business.

00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:41.666
That's probably from yesterday,
when I helped her look for samples.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.750
Yesterday?

00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:46.250
You said you were in Bogor
and Serpong yesterday.

00:08:48.333 --> 00:08:49.416
Darling…

00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:52.208
Farida is my sister.

00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.666
I will always find time to help her,
no matter what.

00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:58.958
Don't you believe me?

00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:02.416
Go ahead and call Farida.

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:05.083
Here.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.458
No, I don't want to.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.083
Darling,

00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:18.625
isn't this normal?

00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:24.208
You always find time for Farida too,
when she needs your help.

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:27.291
Come on.

00:09:28.041 --> 00:09:29.625
Don't jump to conclusions.

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.041
My keys?

00:09:41.083 --> 00:09:42.125
Take care.

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:45.458
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you peace.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.250
Icha!

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:35.833
Amira.

00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.583
-What is it?
-It's Pram.

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:45.625
Pram has been acting strange lately.

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:47.291
He's always working late.

00:10:47.833 --> 00:10:52.458
He says he's only catching up on emails,
but he stays up until 4:00 a.m.

00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:57.125
And whenever I ask,
his answers are never consistent.

00:10:57.791 --> 00:11:01.208
These days, it feels like
he's just pretending to care.

00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:02.375
He's insincere.

00:11:02.458 --> 00:11:03.500
Excuse me.

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:05.958
Amira,

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:07.958
you're a kind soul.

00:11:08.666 --> 00:11:12.916
I know you don't want to think ill of him.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.916
But if Allah has given you signs,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the best thing to do is to find out
whether they're true or not.

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:32.000
I'm so scared, Cha.

00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:35.750
Mir, you know I've been there myself.

00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:39.750
I'm sure you can handle it.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.125
Okay?

00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:58.458
-Good morning, Mrs. Amira.
-Morning.

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:01.541
-Is my husband here?
-He came by earlier.

00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:03.291
But he has a meeting outside.

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:04.875
Where?

00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.625
I'm not sure. He didn't say.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.208
Ms. Sulis, you know about our project
in Emerald Residence?

00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:15.250
I'm sorry, which one? I haven't heard.

00:12:22.166 --> 00:12:26.500
MOM: Where are you, dear?
Join me for lunch.

00:12:27.166 --> 00:12:29.416
-Okay, thanks.
-No problem.

00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:44.750
Oh, my God.

00:13:47.083 --> 00:13:48.125
Amira.

00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:52.916
This is the project you've been busy with?

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.875
It's not like that.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:57.708
I can explain.

00:13:57.791 --> 00:13:59.750
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.125
Amira, I can explain.

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:05.041
-I seek forgiveness from Allah.
-Listen to me.

00:14:05.833 --> 00:14:07.791
I seek forgiveness.

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:09.000
It's not like that.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.458
You have a wife.

00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:14.666
-Honey. I seek forgiveness.
-I can explain.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.166
I don't want to hear it.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.708
There's a reason for this.

00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:19.958
How could you use Farida as an excuse?

00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:21.500
Amira, listen to me!

00:14:21.583 --> 00:14:23.875
-I don't want to hear it!
-I can explain!

00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.208
I don't want your explanation!

00:14:27.583 --> 00:14:28.958
I've seen enough.

00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:33.875
You sinned. You both have sinned!

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.333
Wait.

00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:41.208
Babe.

00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:46.125
Listen to me.

00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:49.291
You've hurt me.

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:50.458
I…

00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:52.833
want to have children.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.916
And you can't give me that.

00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:03.333
This is not the way!

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.500
NURSE ANI

00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:37.875
Hello, Nurse?

00:15:39.083 --> 00:15:42.125
Hello? Where are you, Mrs. Amira?

00:15:43.416 --> 00:15:45.708
Your mother has passed away.

00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:49.125
You need to get here.

00:15:49.208 --> 00:15:51.000
She's gone.

00:18:29.708 --> 00:18:30.791
Do you think

00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:33.916
there's still hope for our marriage?

00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:43.750
I'm pregnant.

00:18:56.041 --> 00:19:00.125
The one you said couldn't give you a child
is now carrying your baby.

00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:05.291
I want you to take responsibility.

00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:14.666
Will you choose me, your legal wife
who's carrying your child,

00:19:17.208 --> 00:19:20.750
or the woman who made you
commit that grave sin?

00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:22.958
Cintia.

00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:27.000
Her name is Cintia.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.000
I don't care what her name is.

00:19:30.666 --> 00:19:32.000
She's pregnant too.

00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:37.625
She's pregnant?

00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:46.041
But I'm pregnant.

00:19:47.916 --> 00:19:49.125
I'm sorry, Amira.

00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:51.375
I'm carrying your child too.

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:53.708
I'm pregnant too.

00:19:54.458 --> 00:19:55.666
She's lying.

00:19:57.791 --> 00:19:59.583
There's no way she's pregnant.

00:20:00.208 --> 00:20:01.291
You believe her?

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.250
Since when has she been here?

00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:05.916
I'm sorry.

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.583
But she needs a comfortable place to live.

00:20:10.666 --> 00:20:12.250
Don't listen to her, babe.

00:20:13.416 --> 00:20:15.791
She's just trying to get your attention.

00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:19.958
Using someone else's test pack
and claiming it's hers.

00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:21.916
Isn't that right?

00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:23.916
How dare you say that?

00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:27.250
Isn't it enough that you took my husband?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.625
I am pregnant too!

00:20:29.708 --> 00:20:32.250
-You're infertile.
-I'm his legal wife!

00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:34.291
-I'm his wife too!
-Stop it.

00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:36.583
-I'm his rightful wife!
-Cut it out.

00:20:36.666 --> 00:20:38.166
-Who are you?
-Amira.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.416
Stop it! Please listen to me!

00:20:41.125 --> 00:20:42.666
We can all live together.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.875
I beg you.

00:20:47.125 --> 00:20:49.333
I can be fair, I promise.

00:20:59.541 --> 00:21:00.583
God.

00:21:10.583 --> 00:21:11.875
God…

00:21:35.166 --> 00:21:36.291
Listen to me.

00:21:37.458 --> 00:21:39.625
I know you're upset, but please…

00:21:39.708 --> 00:21:40.791
Amira.

00:21:41.666 --> 00:21:44.583
Please. Think it over.

00:21:44.666 --> 00:21:46.291
You didn't even think!

00:21:47.125 --> 00:21:49.166
Why are you telling me to think?

00:21:49.791 --> 00:21:50.833
Well, I…

00:21:50.916 --> 00:21:54.041
Did you think
when you brought that woman here?

00:21:54.125 --> 00:21:56.041
Did you think about my feelings?

00:21:59.541 --> 00:22:02.583
Okay! So what do you want now?

00:22:25.208 --> 00:22:27.916
If that's all you can offer,

00:22:28.666 --> 00:22:30.083
I can't do this.

00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:36.000
I want a divorce.

00:24:24.791 --> 00:24:26.000
Oh, my God.

00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:27.708
Help.

00:25:24.916 --> 00:25:25.958
Ma'am?

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:28.291
Can you hear me?

00:25:31.875 --> 00:25:32.875
Ma'am.

00:25:33.541 --> 00:25:34.791
I'm so sorry,

00:25:35.666 --> 00:25:38.333
but you've just had a miscarriage.

00:25:40.208 --> 00:25:43.083
We have to perform
a dilation and curettage.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.375
Are there any family members
we can contact?

00:27:22.208 --> 00:27:23.375
O Allah.

00:27:25.416 --> 00:27:27.541
Why have you given me a trial

00:27:28.208 --> 00:27:30.791
greater than I can bear?

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.750
Why, Allah?

00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:39.375
Why?

00:27:41.125 --> 00:27:42.875
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:44.458
Miss, don't do it!

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:53.041
Everyone in heaven and earth ask him

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.750
Every day he is bringing about
A matter of concern

00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:07.291
So which of the favors of your Lord
Would you deny?

00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:14.666
We will attend to you, O prominent beings

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:22.458
So which of the favors of your Lord
Would you deny?

00:28:24.875 --> 00:28:26.875
Allah has spoken the truth.

00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:31.916
Amira. Thank God.

00:28:32.458 --> 00:28:34.416
Amira. Thank God.

00:28:36.041 --> 00:28:38.958
Allah took everything from me.

00:28:40.041 --> 00:28:41.208
Hey, Amira.

00:28:42.916 --> 00:28:45.250
You shouldn't say that.

00:28:45.333 --> 00:28:46.583
Everything.

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.250
No.

00:28:51.958 --> 00:28:53.375
Everything.

00:28:53.458 --> 00:28:54.458
Amira.

00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:57.541
Maybe this is Allah's way
of protecting you.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.541
He loves you.

00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:11.291
Did you see the person who rescued me?

00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:18.750
Yesterday, I called you like crazy.

00:29:19.583 --> 00:29:20.875
Then he picked up.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.958
I was in such a panic, I came right over.

00:29:26.583 --> 00:29:28.375
When I arrived, he was gone.

00:29:30.125 --> 00:29:31.291
But the nurse

00:29:32.666 --> 00:29:34.958
said he left something for you.

00:29:39.583 --> 00:29:41.875
It's from the person who rescued you.

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:59.625
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.
ALLAH WANTS YOU TO KEEP GOING.

00:30:08.125 --> 00:30:09.250
O Allah.

00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:12.541
What is the meaning behind all this?

00:30:14.041 --> 00:30:16.125
Please guide me.

00:30:17.416 --> 00:30:20.416
Please grant me strength.

00:30:21.333 --> 00:30:23.291
And make me ever thankful.

00:30:28.041 --> 00:30:29.500
Please help me.

00:30:32.083 --> 00:30:33.500
Please help me.

00:30:35.208 --> 00:30:36.708
Please help me.

00:30:38.333 --> 00:30:39.500
Please help me.

00:30:51.833 --> 00:30:53.708
Peace be upon you, Ustadzah.

00:30:53.791 --> 00:30:57.458
-And upon you peace.
-And upon you peace.

00:30:58.291 --> 00:30:59.291
I'm Amira.

00:31:00.333 --> 00:31:05.375
How do we forgive someone

00:31:06.125 --> 00:31:08.083
who has wronged us,

00:31:09.708 --> 00:31:14.625
and how can we let go

00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:17.083
of the past?

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:20.916
That's my question.

00:31:21.625 --> 00:31:22.625
Thank you.

00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:28.791
When we're hurt and feel wronged,

00:31:28.875 --> 00:31:31.291
and we wish to rise again,

00:31:32.041 --> 00:31:34.208
be among the muhsinin.

00:31:34.833 --> 00:31:38.250
They are those who act with kindness
in the eyes of Allah,

00:31:38.333 --> 00:31:41.375
by forgiving others

00:31:41.458 --> 00:31:45.458
and making peace
with everything that happened.

00:31:45.541 --> 00:31:48.375
And I believe you can do it.

00:31:49.375 --> 00:31:50.583
You are strong.

00:31:51.375 --> 00:31:57.125
I know you are patient and strong
in the face of every obstacle.

00:31:57.208 --> 00:32:02.833
And may all of us strive
to endure with patience.

00:32:02.916 --> 00:32:05.916
Thank you, Ustadzah.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.958
Thank you to everyone
who is supporting Ms. Amira.

00:32:12.583 --> 00:32:17.083
As we come to the end of the event,

00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:19.791
let's take a moment to reflect,

00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:23.041
led by Miss Asma Nadia.

00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:24.833
Please.

00:32:27.583 --> 00:32:29.541
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious.

00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:30.916
Everyone,

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.250
let's submit our hearts

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.916
and raise our hands.

00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:41.958
O Allah, the Most Merciful.

00:32:42.875 --> 00:32:48.291
We come before you
carrying all our struggles,

00:32:49.291 --> 00:32:51.083
our sorrow,

00:32:52.083 --> 00:32:54.416
our inner pain,

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:58.083
every tear we've cried in despair.

00:32:59.083 --> 00:33:01.708
We beg you, O Allah,

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.625
we ask you to heal us.

00:33:07.875 --> 00:33:09.708
We want to heal, O Allah.

00:33:10.416 --> 00:33:12.000
Help us heal.

00:33:16.958 --> 00:33:19.541
Thank you for bringing me here.

00:33:19.625 --> 00:33:21.583
You're welcome.

00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:25.833
I'm really happy.

00:33:26.916 --> 00:33:32.500
We all need a place to open up like this.

00:33:32.583 --> 00:33:35.708
Everyone here is willing to listen.

00:33:36.291 --> 00:33:40.208
Mir, this place is literally,
"We listen, we don't judge."

00:33:41.583 --> 00:33:45.750
This place helped me heal
and gave me strength to start over.

00:33:46.708 --> 00:33:47.708
I'm hooked.

00:33:47.791 --> 00:33:48.833
Want to come again?

00:33:48.916 --> 00:33:50.291
-Yeah.
-Really?

00:33:50.375 --> 00:33:52.125
I really enjoyed it.

00:33:52.208 --> 00:33:53.500
That's good to hear.

00:33:53.583 --> 00:33:55.625
Peace be upon you.

00:33:55.708 --> 00:33:58.125
And upon you peace.

00:33:58.208 --> 00:34:00.916
Hello, nice to meet you, Amira. I'm Amel.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.291
I'm Amira Khadijah.

00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:04.208
You asked a great question.

00:34:04.291 --> 00:34:05.875
I hope the session was helpful.

00:34:07.208 --> 00:34:09.833
Bring Amira
for the next gathering too, Icha.

00:34:09.916 --> 00:34:12.250
Of course. She wants to come again.

00:34:12.333 --> 00:34:14.291
I'm hooked.

00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:25.041
Icha.

00:34:26.625 --> 00:34:28.875
I think I know what we should do.

00:34:30.208 --> 00:34:31.416
Sell prayer mats?

00:34:33.958 --> 00:34:37.458
Was that an inside joke?

00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:40.208
Fill me in! Let me join too.

00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:45.083
The event will have more
than just a study session.

00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:49.333
There will be a bazaar
with curated products.

00:34:49.416 --> 00:34:53.416
And the study session should be open

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.250
to both women and men.

00:34:57.875 --> 00:35:03.583
How about calling the event
"Mau Hijrah Fest"?

00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:08.041
Sounds amazing!

00:35:08.125 --> 00:35:09.625
It's a solid idea.

00:35:51.583 --> 00:35:52.583
PRESIDING JUDGE

00:35:52.666 --> 00:35:55.375
The court grants the plaintiff's claim.

00:35:56.125 --> 00:36:02.166
Two, a divorce is issued
by the defendant to the plaintiff.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.583
The hearing is concluded
and officially closed.

00:36:31.958 --> 00:36:32.958
Please read it.

00:36:33.041 --> 00:36:34.125
Thank God.

00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:36.791
-Thank God. Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

00:36:38.875 --> 00:36:42.125
We've arrived at the festival area,

00:36:42.208 --> 00:36:45.791
right at the bridge
leading to the Mau Hijrah Festival!

00:36:45.875 --> 00:36:48.416
See you don't miss out
on the Mau Hijrah Fest.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.333
Thanks.

00:36:49.416 --> 00:36:50.333
Hey.

00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:53.583
Have you checked our office setup
next to Icha's cafe?

00:36:53.666 --> 00:36:55.750
I have. It looks amazing.

00:36:55.833 --> 00:36:57.541
Really? Thank God.

00:36:57.625 --> 00:36:59.166
I'm happy to work with you.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.708
I'm glad you like it.

00:37:00.791 --> 00:37:04.333
Let me introduce you
to some tenants I know.

00:37:04.416 --> 00:37:05.708
Sounds great. Let's go.

00:37:05.791 --> 00:37:06.791
This is a favorite.

00:37:06.875 --> 00:37:08.166
Barra, Rayhan.

00:37:08.833 --> 00:37:09.958
Meet Amira.

00:37:10.041 --> 00:37:11.333
Hi, I'm Amira.

00:37:12.333 --> 00:37:14.708
Ms. Amira, the founder of Mau Hijrah Fest?

00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:16.916
She's one I told you about.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.083
Amel has told me about you guys too.

00:37:19.166 --> 00:37:21.666
I heard you have a great fanbase.

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.125
Praise be to God.

00:37:23.208 --> 00:37:24.875
-Yes, praise be to God.
-Thank God.

00:37:24.958 --> 00:37:28.333
Especially after Amel helped us
with her content creation.

00:37:28.416 --> 00:37:29.750
That's a given.

00:37:30.833 --> 00:37:33.291
But it's true. They first started online,

00:37:33.375 --> 00:37:35.333
then branched out to offline,

00:37:35.416 --> 00:37:38.000
and now they're coming to Mau Hijrah Fest.

00:37:38.083 --> 00:37:39.083
Thank God.

00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:43.250
I hope that joining us here
will lead to something positive.

00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:44.791
-Amen.
-Amen.

00:37:44.875 --> 00:37:47.250
We appreciate you providing us this space.

00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:49.375
We should get going.

00:37:49.458 --> 00:37:51.291
Shall we see the other tenants?

00:37:51.375 --> 00:37:52.333
-Sure.
-Okay.

00:37:52.416 --> 00:37:53.250
See you.

00:37:53.958 --> 00:37:55.041
I'll be back.

00:37:57.916 --> 00:37:59.000
She's pretty.

00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:01.166
Right.

00:38:01.666 --> 00:38:02.750
Which one?

00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:06.083
Which one what?

00:38:08.833 --> 00:38:10.250
-What?
-Get back to work.

00:38:10.958 --> 00:38:12.791
The guests are coming.

00:38:12.875 --> 00:38:14.125
Peace be upon you.

00:38:14.208 --> 00:38:15.541
And upon you peace.

00:38:16.291 --> 00:38:17.708
How was your day?

00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:20.208
-It went smoothly.
-That's great.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:23.125
Here, I got you

00:38:24.208 --> 00:38:25.750
your favorite banana bread, Mom.

00:38:25.833 --> 00:38:26.916
Praise be to God.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.833
But savor it. Don't finish it right away.

00:38:29.916 --> 00:38:32.208
-What, worried I'll gain weight?
-No.

00:38:32.291 --> 00:38:34.750
-I made you tea.
-Thanks, Mom.

00:38:34.833 --> 00:38:36.125
Mom.

00:38:37.166 --> 00:38:38.375
There's…

00:38:39.541 --> 00:38:41.583
something I want to tell you.

00:38:43.166 --> 00:38:44.291
-Come.
-Yes.

00:38:52.041 --> 00:38:53.125
Listen.

00:38:54.375 --> 00:38:57.250
About my arranged marriage with Amel…

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.833
I would like to pray istikhara first.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.416
Istikhara…

00:39:12.833 --> 00:39:17.291
is for people facing difficult choices
or dilemmas.

00:39:20.375 --> 00:39:21.625
Do you feel that way?

00:39:24.083 --> 00:39:25.166
Mom,

00:39:26.208 --> 00:39:28.083
marriage is a form of worship,

00:39:28.875 --> 00:39:30.875
ideally a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

00:39:31.458 --> 00:39:36.458
So I really want
to seek guidance from Allah.

00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:51.000
I want what's best for you.

00:39:52.958 --> 00:39:54.500
But keep in mind,

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:58.875
your arranged marriage with Amel
was your father's last wish.

00:40:00.666 --> 00:40:04.083
I also think Amel
is the right match for you.

00:40:05.166 --> 00:40:07.708
You've known each other since childhood.

00:40:09.083 --> 00:40:11.208
Makes it easier to adjust.

00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:20.666
Okay, thank you.

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:21.875
Praise God.

00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:27.000
Well, then, my righteous
and virtuous besties, let's welcome

00:40:27.083 --> 00:40:29.208
the founder of Mau Hijrah Fest,

00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:31.208
Ms. Amira Khadijah!

00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:39.625
Thanks.

00:40:43.083 --> 00:40:45.791
Peace be upon you,
and God's mercy and blessings.

00:40:45.875 --> 00:40:49.958
And upon you peace,
God's mercy and blessings.

00:40:50.541 --> 00:40:57.250
Thanks to Allah, we're able
to gather here today, safe and sound.

00:40:57.333 --> 00:41:03.000
My team at Mau Hijrah Fest and I believe

00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:09.250
everyone needs a supportive community.

00:41:10.166 --> 00:41:11.500
As…

00:41:12.875 --> 00:41:17.208
someone who has experienced
despair myself,

00:41:18.583 --> 00:41:24.958
and found new life through a community,

00:41:28.125 --> 00:41:30.291
I really hope

00:41:31.333 --> 00:41:37.416
this space provides safety and comfort
for everyone to open up.

00:41:38.625 --> 00:41:40.375
-Amen.
-In God's name,

00:41:41.375 --> 00:41:44.708
with this, Mau Hijrah Fest
is officially open.

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:16.791
Amira.

00:42:17.416 --> 00:42:18.541
Yes, Barra?

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.541
-Busy day today?
-Praise God, it was.

00:42:23.625 --> 00:42:24.875
Praise God.

00:42:24.958 --> 00:42:27.458
Rayhan had to leave early

00:42:27.541 --> 00:42:30.541
to check the stock
in the warehouse for tomorrow.

00:42:30.625 --> 00:42:33.833
I hope your business stays busy
all the way through.

00:42:33.916 --> 00:42:35.333
Amen, God willing.

00:42:38.708 --> 00:42:40.250
You know, you amaze me.

00:42:41.416 --> 00:42:43.208
-What?
-Yes.

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:46.916
Your opening speech moved me.

00:42:48.458 --> 00:42:51.041
I admire how

00:42:51.125 --> 00:42:55.083
you used your own experience
to help others reflect.

00:42:55.666 --> 00:42:58.916
It shows that you care about others.

00:43:02.125 --> 00:43:06.000
I can't go into much detail,

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:11.125
but someone once told me

00:43:13.166 --> 00:43:15.541
that Allah wants me to keep going.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.708
Since then, I realized that everyone
has their own struggles.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.583
Having a space to share or open up

00:43:28.666 --> 00:43:33.500
might make it easier to keep going.

00:43:41.083 --> 00:43:45.666
I've always dreamed of going to Baitullah

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.875
with my lawful partner one day.

00:43:48.916 --> 00:43:50.958
But what I want to ask is,

00:43:51.041 --> 00:43:54.208
what should we do
when we can't find a partner

00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:58.458
who shares the same vision and goals?

00:43:59.708 --> 00:44:02.958
Our soulmate is a divine secret.

00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:05.708
Remember, what we think is good for us

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:08.916
may not be good in Allah's eyes,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.791
but what is good in Allah's eyes,

00:44:11.875 --> 00:44:13.916
is always the best option for us.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.666
Always have faith
in what Allah has given us.

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.666
Always strive to improve ourselves,

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.333
to be a virtuous man or woman,

00:44:21.416 --> 00:44:25.458
and God willing,
he will grant us a virtuous partner.

00:44:25.541 --> 00:44:27.375
-Amen.
-Amen, praise God.

00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:28.916
Thank you, Ustadz.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.083
Thank you.

00:44:31.291 --> 00:44:32.333
Praise God.

00:44:32.416 --> 00:44:34.666
Peace be upon you, Barra.

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:35.875
And upon you peace.

00:44:35.958 --> 00:44:37.791
-Is it a bad time?
-No. Why?

00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:39.791
-Did you eat?
-Not yet.u7

00:44:40.416 --> 00:44:43.291
Perfect, I brought you lunch.

00:44:44.291 --> 00:44:46.000
You didn't have to.

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:50.375
No trouble at all. It's a viral dish,
so I made it for you.

00:44:50.458 --> 00:44:51.875
You must try it.

00:44:53.708 --> 00:44:56.708
Must be nice having someone who cares

00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:58.708
and makes you lunch.

00:44:59.666 --> 00:45:01.416
I wish I had that too.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.125
Come on, look how much there is.
We can share.

00:45:05.208 --> 00:45:08.375
Yeah, I made a lot. We can eat together.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.625
-You sure?
-Of course. Let's eat over there.

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:13.125
If you insist.

00:45:13.208 --> 00:45:14.791
But the customers…

00:45:14.875 --> 00:45:16.333
Never refuse sustenance.

00:45:16.416 --> 00:45:18.583
Who's gonna watch the store?

00:45:19.166 --> 00:45:23.000
I made this viral dish. Here.

00:45:25.208 --> 00:45:26.375
There's also extra.

00:45:28.916 --> 00:45:31.375
Can you help me with something?

00:45:32.125 --> 00:45:33.791
-What is it?
-Well…

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:38.291
Barra.

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:40.958
-Hi, Amira.
-Where's Amel?

00:45:41.583 --> 00:45:43.291
She left.

00:45:43.375 --> 00:45:44.375
What?

00:45:44.458 --> 00:45:48.916
Amel's got a last-minute meeting
with a brand,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.500
so she can't accompany you.

00:45:51.583 --> 00:45:54.541
She asked me to take you there.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:58.750
It's okay, I'll get a taxi.

00:45:58.833 --> 00:46:01.083
No need, I can give you a ride.

00:46:01.166 --> 00:46:02.375
-You shouldn't.
-I insist.

00:46:02.458 --> 00:46:05.083
Besides, I've loaded everything
in the car.

00:46:06.458 --> 00:46:07.541
So…

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:10.458
Gosh.

00:46:11.083 --> 00:46:13.291
Don't worry about it. I'll drive you.

00:46:21.083 --> 00:46:22.166
Let's go.

00:46:26.333 --> 00:46:27.750
Sorry about this.

00:46:27.833 --> 00:46:29.041
No problem.

00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:35.208
Excuse me.

00:46:39.041 --> 00:46:43.333
Is donating to this orphanage

00:46:43.416 --> 00:46:46.750
part of the festival program?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.083
Not really.

00:46:51.083 --> 00:46:54.333
But it would be cool
to include it in the program.

00:46:54.416 --> 00:46:55.583
It would be.

00:47:03.041 --> 00:47:04.333
Peace be upon you.

00:47:04.416 --> 00:47:07.625
And upon you peace.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.875
Hi. Oh my God.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.958
Where should I put this?

00:47:17.041 --> 00:47:18.500
Over there is fine.

00:47:22.916 --> 00:47:24.458
Wanna play?

00:47:28.583 --> 00:47:29.875
Bye.

00:47:31.291 --> 00:47:32.833
How exciting.

00:47:35.625 --> 00:47:38.125
You've got someone to take you around now?

00:47:40.208 --> 00:47:42.791
Don't make it awkward.

00:47:42.875 --> 00:47:44.750
You blushed.

00:48:24.125 --> 00:48:26.041
Are you guys getting dinner?

00:48:26.125 --> 00:48:28.958
Yeah. We can eat here, right?

00:48:29.041 --> 00:48:30.083
Sure.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.250
I have to leave now.

00:48:32.833 --> 00:48:34.083
My ride is here.

00:48:34.625 --> 00:48:36.333
What, why?

00:48:37.416 --> 00:48:41.208
It's nothing, enjoy your time together.

00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:43.250
Peace be upon you.

00:48:43.333 --> 00:48:44.916
Icha.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.541
-And upon you peace.
-Icha.

00:48:51.291 --> 00:48:52.333
Here you go.

00:48:52.958 --> 00:48:53.958
Thank you.

00:48:54.583 --> 00:48:55.666
Wow.

00:48:58.083 --> 00:48:59.750
You're an only child?

00:49:02.708 --> 00:49:03.791
Yeah.

00:49:04.791 --> 00:49:05.833
My dad

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:08.625
passed away two years ago.

00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:11.416
So now it's just me and my mom.

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:15.583
Me too.

00:49:17.666 --> 00:49:21.416
My dad passed away when I was seven,

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:27.083
and my mom just recently passed away,
seven months ago.

00:49:28.916 --> 00:49:31.625
We belong to Allah
and to him we shall return.

00:49:32.208 --> 00:49:33.541
My condolences.

00:49:34.666 --> 00:49:35.791
Thanks.

00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:39.916
-Ms. Amira.
-Yes?

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.583
I drew this for you.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.000
Thank you. Bye-bye.

00:49:44.958 --> 00:49:46.000
Thank you.

00:49:48.458 --> 00:49:49.666
That's cute.

00:49:52.916 --> 00:49:54.916
It's their token of appreciation.

00:49:56.208 --> 00:49:58.208
It's something I always wanted.

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:01.833
What is?

00:50:03.666 --> 00:50:04.875
To become a mother.

00:50:11.791 --> 00:50:13.041
Praise God.

00:50:14.166 --> 00:50:17.625
Today, you've been like a mother,

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:21.583
a big sister and a friend to them.

00:50:26.458 --> 00:50:27.875
Something to be thankful for.

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:29.500
This is for you too, actually.

00:50:29.583 --> 00:50:31.833
THANK YOU FOR BEING OUR MOTHER
AND FATHER TODAY.

00:50:33.916 --> 00:50:35.875
You're right.

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:37.916
What about Icha?

00:51:03.125 --> 00:51:05.333
BARRA: Thank you for opening up.

00:51:05.416 --> 00:51:09.291
May Allah bring better days
in return for your pain and loss.

00:51:33.208 --> 00:51:35.625
Thanks for all your help
and for listening to me.

00:51:35.708 --> 00:51:36.708
May Allah reward you.

00:51:47.208 --> 00:51:48.208
Wait a minute.

00:51:48.708 --> 00:51:49.875
You should eat.

00:51:50.958 --> 00:51:52.875
Thanks, I'll take one.

00:51:53.958 --> 00:51:58.375
-Want some?
-May I? I thought it was only for Amira.

00:51:58.458 --> 00:51:59.916
-No.
-Icha!

00:52:01.291 --> 00:52:04.375
Very fragrant.
Did you use deodorant to cook it?

00:52:04.458 --> 00:52:05.625
Slowly.

00:52:06.833 --> 00:52:08.166
Hot.

00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:50.000
Amira.

00:52:51.416 --> 00:52:54.375
This is the book
I told you about last night.

00:52:55.583 --> 00:52:57.208
TAWAKAL
FULLY SURRENDERING TO ALLAH

00:52:59.166 --> 00:53:00.333
Thanks.

00:53:06.875 --> 00:53:07.916
Barra.

00:53:10.041 --> 00:53:11.916
You and Amira seem to be getting along.

00:53:12.916 --> 00:53:15.000
She just lent me a book.

00:53:17.166 --> 00:53:18.833
Here, I brought you lunch.

00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:23.666
-Another viral recipe?
-Of course.

00:53:26.125 --> 00:53:27.333
Good luck with work.

00:53:28.458 --> 00:53:29.500
Thank you.

00:53:30.625 --> 00:53:31.625
Rayhan.

00:53:32.291 --> 00:53:33.375
Keep it up.

00:53:41.458 --> 00:53:42.791
Two options, huh?

00:53:44.375 --> 00:53:46.708
Just pick one.

00:53:46.791 --> 00:53:48.583
I'll take the other.

00:53:49.208 --> 00:53:50.750
I'll take the other.

00:53:50.833 --> 00:53:53.166
You're just after the food, aren't you?

00:53:53.875 --> 00:53:55.166
You know me so well.

00:53:57.791 --> 00:53:59.041
Save some for me.

00:53:59.583 --> 00:54:01.875
I've got the photos from yesterday.

00:54:01.958 --> 00:54:05.500
You can use them as samples
for your program.

00:54:05.583 --> 00:54:09.041
Pick the ones you want to share
on social media first.

00:54:09.125 --> 00:54:10.500
Sure, I'll choose them.

00:54:10.583 --> 00:54:12.250
-Here you go.
-Okay.

00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:15.416
-So many photos!
-Take your time.

00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:18.375
In the meantime, I'll go over the rundown.

00:54:20.875 --> 00:54:22.125
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:54:22.916 --> 00:54:26.583
Icha, there's a complaint from a tenant.
Can you come with me?

00:54:28.208 --> 00:54:31.750
-Okay. Mel, I'll leave you to it.
-Let me know what you need.

00:54:31.833 --> 00:54:33.750
-Yeah, thanks.
-Keep me posted.

00:55:11.291 --> 00:55:13.083
-Where?
-Over there.

00:55:13.916 --> 00:55:15.000
Amira.

00:55:29.041 --> 00:55:30.083
Amira.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.625
You ignored my texts and calls,
so I had to come here.

00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:38.375
Our relationship is over.

00:55:39.125 --> 00:55:40.208
I miss you.

00:55:41.958 --> 00:55:44.291
I can't find peace in life without you.

00:55:44.375 --> 00:55:48.166
-My life is a mess. You know I can't--
-You ruined your own life.

00:55:50.291 --> 00:55:52.625
Just when I've finally
got my life together,

00:55:52.708 --> 00:55:55.083
you show up trying to ruin it again?

00:55:57.041 --> 00:55:59.291
There's nothing between us now, Pram.

00:55:59.916 --> 00:56:02.625
Please leave
while I'm still asking nicely.

00:56:03.416 --> 00:56:04.583
I know I was wrong,

00:56:04.666 --> 00:56:06.833
and I'm sorry, Amira.

00:56:07.416 --> 00:56:09.583
But we all have sins.

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:11.583
I've sinned, so have you.

00:56:11.666 --> 00:56:12.916
Remember this,

00:56:13.625 --> 00:56:14.708
abortion

00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:17.083
is one of the major sins.

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:19.375
Remember that!

00:56:26.625 --> 00:56:28.166
I had a miscarriage.

00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:33.541
I lost the baby

00:56:33.625 --> 00:56:36.875
I had been waiting for,
for over five years

00:56:36.958 --> 00:56:38.416
because of what you did.

00:56:42.166 --> 00:56:43.916
Don't ever come back.

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:49.083
If you just want to hurt me,
I won't forgive you.

00:56:52.875 --> 00:56:53.958
My God.

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.250
Peace be upon you.

00:57:12.333 --> 00:57:14.208
And upon you peace.

00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:15.291
Come in, Mel.

00:57:15.916 --> 00:57:17.500
Hi, Aunty.

00:57:18.291 --> 00:57:19.458
Aunty.

00:57:19.541 --> 00:57:23.166
Praise God, Allah granted my prayer.

00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:25.500
What prayer?

00:57:25.583 --> 00:57:28.750
Remember when I told you

00:57:28.833 --> 00:57:31.666
I really wanted to take
prewedding photos at Baitullah?

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:32.958
Yes, and?

00:57:33.958 --> 00:57:36.458
Praise God, I just got a job there!

00:57:36.541 --> 00:57:38.208
That's great.

00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:40.291
We can take the prewedding photos there.

00:57:40.375 --> 00:57:41.833
Have you talked to Barra?

00:57:41.916 --> 00:57:43.166
Not yet.

00:57:44.458 --> 00:57:48.875
There's still time to plan it out.
Sit down. Barra!

00:57:50.541 --> 00:57:52.375
-Is he awake?
-More viral food?

00:57:52.458 --> 00:57:54.000
-Yeah.
-I woke him up.

00:57:54.083 --> 00:57:57.416
-These all have unique flavors.
-Smells good.

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.208
This one's matcha,
and this one's chocolate.

00:58:00.291 --> 00:58:01.708
Amel got you breakfast.

00:58:01.791 --> 00:58:03.791
Have you eaten?

00:58:03.875 --> 00:58:05.791
I brought you some donuts.

00:58:05.875 --> 00:58:06.750
Want some tea?

00:58:06.833 --> 00:58:08.500
-No, Aunty.
-You can help yourself.

00:58:08.583 --> 00:58:09.958
I'll have a bite.

00:58:10.041 --> 00:58:12.125
Make sure you savor it.

00:58:16.041 --> 00:58:18.500
You didn't tell me Amel was coming over.

00:58:18.583 --> 00:58:19.916
Do I have to?

00:58:20.541 --> 00:58:22.916
Amel comes here all the time.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.875
I've got a brand job at Sarah's place,

00:58:25.958 --> 00:58:29.250
so I thought I'd bring breakfast
for Aunty too.

00:58:29.333 --> 00:58:31.250
For me or for him?

00:58:31.333 --> 00:58:32.541
Aunty…

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:38.500
Amel, do you need a ride?

00:58:41.333 --> 00:58:43.875
Are you offering to take me
to my photoshoot location?

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.708
I'd love that.

00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:07.708
One, two, wait for it…

00:59:07.791 --> 00:59:09.000
Again.

00:59:10.041 --> 00:59:12.041
Okay, smile. One, two…

00:59:12.958 --> 00:59:14.916
Okay, we'll change set.

00:59:15.625 --> 00:59:17.208
Props and makeup, please.

00:59:18.708 --> 00:59:19.750
How did I do?

00:59:21.166 --> 00:59:22.291
Amazing.

00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:24.833
-Let me see.
-Thanks.

00:59:27.708 --> 00:59:29.541
What would you like to eat?

00:59:29.625 --> 00:59:31.541
-Anything is fine, thanks.
-Okay.

00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:33.416
-I'll prepare it.
-All right.

00:59:35.208 --> 00:59:38.291
-Thanks for keeping me company.
-You're welcome.

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.791
Have lunch with me.

00:59:40.875 --> 00:59:43.333
Sure… but…

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.541
Can we talk before that?

00:59:47.041 --> 00:59:48.000
Okay.

00:59:48.541 --> 00:59:50.083
-Where?
-Here is fine.

00:59:50.166 --> 00:59:52.125
-Here?
-Yeah. Wait.

00:59:52.208 --> 00:59:53.250
Sit down.

00:59:53.958 --> 00:59:55.958
What do you want to talk about?

00:59:57.666 --> 00:59:58.666
Listen, Mel.

00:59:59.916 --> 01:00:01.875
It's about our arranged marriage.

01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:03.583
Yeah?

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.000
I need to pray istikhara first.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.791
Are you still unsure?

01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:19.875
I've got something on my mind,

01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:23.875
but I can't tell you right now.

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:28.958
Besides, marriage is a big deal.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.458
It's only right to think it through.

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:36.416
So…

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.250
You okay with it?

01:00:43.666 --> 01:00:44.708
Yeah.

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:48.375
It's all right.
God willing, I'll be waiting.

01:01:00.291 --> 01:01:02.833
-All good today?
-All good.

01:01:02.916 --> 01:01:07.916
Praise God. By the way,
the promotion team is coming tomorrow.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.125
-Okay.
-Thanks.

01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:10.416
You're welcome.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:20.916
Can we talk?

01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:24.041
Not here.

01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:37.333
What do you want, Pram?

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:44.250
Get back together with me.
Please, I beg you. Come back to me.

01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:47.083
Pram.

01:01:47.166 --> 01:01:48.583
You made your choice.

01:01:49.416 --> 01:01:50.958
We separated peacefully.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.208
Your wife is expecting.

01:01:53.875 --> 01:01:57.541
You're finally getting
what you always wanted!

01:01:57.625 --> 01:01:59.166
Don't be foolish!

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:01.791
-No, Amira! Please!
-Pram!

01:02:01.875 --> 01:02:03.375
Do whatever you want to me.

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:05.083
Slap me if you want.

01:02:05.166 --> 01:02:06.791
-Pram! Oh, my God!
-I'm sorry!

01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:08.500
-Slap me.
-Pram, that's enough!

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:09.791
-I'm sorry!
-Shameless!

01:02:09.875 --> 01:02:12.041
I'm not letting go until you forgive me.

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:14.583
-Amira, I need you!
-Let me go!

01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:18.958
-Pram, that's enough!
-Forgive me! I'm sorry!

01:02:19.041 --> 01:02:20.750
-Stop it!
-Hey!

01:02:20.833 --> 01:02:21.916
Leave!

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:30.916
Who are you?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.083
Who?

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:34.916
Stay out of this.

01:02:36.583 --> 01:02:38.500
Pram, stop!

01:02:38.583 --> 01:02:40.375
-Oh, my God.
-Stay out of this!

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:47.375
Barra, enough.

01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:51.250
You should know
that Amira once lost all hope

01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:53.375
and almost ended her life because of you!

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:59.958
And now, after surviving all that,
you want to hurt her again?

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.166
You want to be a hero?

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.583
You like playing the hero?

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:12.000
You like playing the hero!

01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:13.750
-Hey!
-What do you want?

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:14.875
Amira!

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.916
Stop!

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.625
-Let go!
-Stop!

01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:19.833
Let me go!

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.333
Are you okay, Amira?

01:03:22.416 --> 01:03:25.125
Just watch, Amira!

01:03:25.208 --> 01:03:27.791
You won't find happiness without me!

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:30.416
-Wait here.
-You'll always fail!

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.708
-Remember that! Let go of me!
-Get him out of here!

01:03:33.791 --> 01:03:34.958
Amira.

01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:38.166
You should stand your ground!

01:03:39.625 --> 01:03:42.458
With this attitude,
he'll keep coming back to you!

01:03:42.541 --> 01:03:43.625
Barra.

01:03:46.541 --> 01:03:50.166
Just because I shared my story with you,

01:03:51.875 --> 01:03:55.625
and just because you saved my life,

01:03:57.583 --> 01:04:00.916
doesn't mean you can dictate
how I should behave!

01:04:48.375 --> 01:04:49.541
What's wrong?

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:58.291
Mom.

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:03.208
I'm sorry.

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:07.791
I…

01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:12.000
can't go through
with the arranged marriage with Amel.

01:05:18.083 --> 01:05:20.458
I've fallen in love with another woman.

01:05:23.416 --> 01:05:24.708
Her name is Amira.

01:05:41.916 --> 01:05:43.083
Amira.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.666
I'm sorry about last night.

01:05:50.833 --> 01:05:52.916
-I shouldn't have said that--
-Barra.

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:56.125
I should be the one apologizing.

01:05:57.541 --> 01:05:59.916
You… are right.

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:03.166
I should have stood my ground.

01:06:06.375 --> 01:06:09.166
I just couldn't accept
what you said last night.

01:06:14.208 --> 01:06:17.625
Why didn't you tell me
it was you who saved my life?

01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:24.208
I assumed that day
was something you'd want to forget.

01:06:35.833 --> 01:06:38.083
If it wasn't for you,

01:06:41.583 --> 01:06:43.583
I might not be here today.

01:06:45.625 --> 01:06:46.708
Thank you.

01:06:48.166 --> 01:06:50.041
For saving me that day.

01:06:51.958 --> 01:06:53.958
And for helping me last night.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.958
All right. Just leave it empty.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.416
We'll make an announcement.

01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:29.750
-Mel, can you--
-It's done.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.291
I made the announcement.

01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:34.208
Take a look in the drive.

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:36.666
Are we done here?

01:07:37.625 --> 01:07:40.541
I have to go, something urgent came up.
Peace be upon you.

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:42.000
And upon you peace.

01:07:42.083 --> 01:07:43.250
Take care.

01:07:46.125 --> 01:07:47.250
What happened?

01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:01.208
Late dinner?

01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:04.041
I only had time now.

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.083
Who are you leaving with today?

01:08:08.875 --> 01:08:12.875
By myself. But I didn't bring my car,
so I'll get a taxi.

01:08:15.875 --> 01:08:17.375
I can give you a ride.

01:08:19.875 --> 01:08:22.416
No, it's fine. I just started eating.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.125
I can wait.

01:08:24.208 --> 01:08:25.833
I eat slowly.

01:08:25.916 --> 01:08:27.000
I'll still wait.

01:08:28.333 --> 01:08:29.541
Please continue.

01:08:30.916 --> 01:08:32.000
Enjoy your meal.

01:08:45.458 --> 01:08:47.541
So you can eat comfortably.

01:08:58.708 --> 01:08:59.750
Barra.

01:09:01.166 --> 01:09:02.250
Thank you.

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:04.916
You're welcome.

01:09:06.166 --> 01:09:07.250
Amira…

01:09:12.291 --> 01:09:13.375
I…

01:09:16.541 --> 01:09:19.375
I want to get to know you better.

01:09:21.416 --> 01:09:23.166
I'd like to introduce you

01:09:24.375 --> 01:09:26.708
to another woman who means a lot to me,

01:09:28.166 --> 01:09:29.125
my mother.

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:34.041
I told my mom about you.

01:09:34.708 --> 01:09:36.125
She'd like to meet you.

01:09:41.708 --> 01:09:43.583
I appreciate it.

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:46.291
I should go inside.

01:09:47.625 --> 01:09:50.041
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you peace.

01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:51.875
Let's go.

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.125
Peace be upon you.

01:10:59.583 --> 01:11:00.666
Barra.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.166
Mom, this is Amira. Amira, this is my mom.

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:05.916
Peace be upon you, I'm Amira.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.083
And upon you peace.

01:11:07.166 --> 01:11:08.958
I brought some dessert.

01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:11.666
I didn't expect this. Thank you.

01:11:13.833 --> 01:11:15.125
Come in.

01:11:22.333 --> 01:11:25.166
I made chicken opor,

01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:28.166
egg stew and potato fritters.

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:31.083
I hope you like it.
This is what I usually make.

01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:33.541
Thank you, Aunty.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:36.333
And upon you peace, Han.

01:11:41.833 --> 01:11:43.541
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:46.791
-Fine. I'm on my way.
-I'm opening this.

01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:47.916
It's brownies.

01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:50.166
Mom, I'm so sorry.

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:51.583
-Rayhan?
-Yeah.

01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:56.125
Something came up at the basecamp,
he needs my help.

01:11:56.208 --> 01:11:57.500
I'll be right back.

01:11:57.583 --> 01:11:58.875
Are you okay, Amira?

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:00.541
Yeah, it's fine.

01:12:01.208 --> 01:12:02.750
I'll be quick.

01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:05.583
Give me 30 minutes. Peace be upon you.

01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:08.500
-And upon you peace.
-And upon you peace. Be careful.

01:12:08.583 --> 01:12:10.500
-Aunty, let me help.
-Okay, here.

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:15.041
Marriage is no small thing.

01:12:15.833 --> 01:12:18.333
We have to meet the right person.

01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:22.708
Sometimes, we think
we've found the right one,

01:12:23.416 --> 01:12:25.708
only to realize we were wrong.

01:12:26.958 --> 01:12:28.000
Aunty…

01:12:30.375 --> 01:12:33.791
I've been married before and had a…

01:12:37.458 --> 01:12:39.000
Barra told me.

01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:46.166
Actually, before he met you,

01:12:46.958 --> 01:12:49.625
Barra's marriage was already arranged.

01:12:50.708 --> 01:12:53.375
Both families agreed to this
a long time ago.

01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:55.291
However,

01:12:56.625 --> 01:12:58.041
he came to me

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.833
and told me that he fell in love with you.

01:13:03.083 --> 01:13:05.208
He has every right to fall in love.

01:13:05.916 --> 01:13:07.541
I have no say in that.

01:13:09.666 --> 01:13:12.541
Have a seat, I'll get some more food.

01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:28.750
Mel.

01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:32.875
-You don't want to talk inside?
-Here's fine.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.750
You want to order a drink?

01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:39.041
I'm good. I just had breakfast.

01:13:42.083 --> 01:13:44.875
Is there something going on
with you and Barra?

01:13:47.416 --> 01:13:49.875
Why the sudden question?

01:13:52.125 --> 01:13:54.541
Barra's marriage was already arranged.

01:13:57.125 --> 01:13:58.875
With me.

01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:04.041
Oh, my God. Mel.

01:14:05.166 --> 01:14:06.916
I had no idea.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I knew you two were friends,

01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:11.166
but I didn't realize
it was more than that.

01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:13.291
We're supposed to be married soon.

01:14:15.666 --> 01:14:20.458
We're not dating or engaged,
but we planned to get married.

01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:22.458
I didn't realize,

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:24.791
but since he met you,
Barra's been different.

01:14:24.875 --> 01:14:26.708
He's unsure about me.

01:14:28.958 --> 01:14:31.416
At first I thought it was nothing.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.083
But as time went on,

01:14:34.166 --> 01:14:36.291
he's gotten closer to you.

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.708
I'm sure you can find a partner.

01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:45.791
Just please, not Barra. I beg you.

01:14:50.083 --> 01:14:51.375
I understand.

01:14:52.041 --> 01:14:54.166
I'm so sorry.

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:56.208
Mel, oh, my God.

01:14:56.291 --> 01:15:00.458
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:05.458
Please not Barra, anyone else but Barra.

01:15:26.791 --> 01:15:29.708
The number you are calling is busy.
Please try…

01:15:35.333 --> 01:15:36.458
Pick up, Amira.

01:15:54.791 --> 01:15:55.958
POWER OFF

01:15:58.583 --> 01:16:01.875
The number you are calling is busy.
Please try…

01:16:14.166 --> 01:16:15.416
Hope you like it.

01:16:18.416 --> 01:16:20.583
-Are we done?
-Almost.

01:16:20.666 --> 01:16:23.083
-After this, we can close up.
-Thank God.

01:16:25.166 --> 01:16:26.916
Amira. Amira!

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:29.250
Amira.

01:16:33.083 --> 01:16:34.833
Amira, what's going on?

01:16:36.208 --> 01:16:38.041
Why are you ignoring me?

01:16:38.125 --> 01:16:39.291
Barra!

01:16:39.375 --> 01:16:40.625
Give me time.

01:16:41.583 --> 01:16:43.166
I don't want to talk to you.

01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:47.583
At least tell me,
so I'm not left guessing!

01:16:47.666 --> 01:16:50.416
You didn't tell me
about your arrangement with Amel.

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.791
You didn't say anything
and left me confused!

01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:56.208
Amira, that was…

01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:02.166
That arranged marriage
was my parents' wish, not mine!

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:03.291
I didn't know!

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.333
It's not my business!

01:17:06.375 --> 01:17:07.416
Please.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.583
Stay away from me.

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:14.750
Amira.

01:17:15.333 --> 01:17:16.416
Amira!

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:22.458
I never intended to deceive Amira.

01:17:23.625 --> 01:17:27.541
I just haven't talked to her about it

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.958
because I wanted to resolve my issues.

01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:33.875
Intentionally or not,

01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:35.791
you've been dishonest

01:17:35.875 --> 01:17:39.208
by not resolving your issues
before getting close to someone else.

01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:43.291
You know how she is.

01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:46.166
You know what she's been through.

01:17:47.291 --> 01:17:49.541
What you're doing is only scaring her,

01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:54.958
and causing her to question her worth
and if she deserves happiness.

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:25.416
-Amira.
-Barra.

01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:30.791
I'm not someone who falls in love easily.

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:33.041
But I admit,

01:18:33.791 --> 01:18:37.875
your brief presence made me feel wanted.

01:18:41.041 --> 01:18:44.208
That feeling means a lot to me.

01:18:46.791 --> 01:18:49.375
I've decided that,

01:18:51.708 --> 01:18:55.333
for now, I don't want to be
in a relationship with anyone.

01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:58.458
I want to find peace

01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:02.500
and work on my own happiness.

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:10.625
Amel is a good woman.

01:19:11.625 --> 01:19:13.125
Please think it over.

01:19:16.916 --> 01:19:20.208
Thank you for your help.

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:24.000
I'm sorry.

01:19:30.208 --> 01:19:31.875
Peace be upon you, Barra.

01:20:08.833 --> 01:20:10.916
What you think is good for you

01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:15.000
may not be good in Allah's eyes.

01:20:36.625 --> 01:20:38.208
Was I always

01:20:39.208 --> 01:20:43.208
walking so close to the edge
without even noticing?

01:20:45.375 --> 01:20:47.625
Is that why I keep falling?

01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:53.708
If so,

01:20:56.541 --> 01:21:01.541
please give me the strength and patience

01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:07.541
to keep rising to my feet.

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:22.208
Don't let me fall any further.

01:21:23.666 --> 01:21:25.041
Barra, look.

01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:27.958
-Do you think this is enough?
-Peace be upon you.

01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:29.958
Yes, hello?

01:21:30.916 --> 01:21:32.083
Say that again.

01:21:37.333 --> 01:21:40.250
-He's busy.
-Right.

01:21:55.791 --> 01:21:57.416
Please watch over my home.

01:21:57.916 --> 01:22:00.333
Of course, I'll drop by often.

01:22:04.041 --> 01:22:05.125
Sir.

01:22:08.250 --> 01:22:09.500
Take care.

01:22:09.583 --> 01:22:11.708
Let me know if anything happens.

01:22:11.791 --> 01:22:14.416
Yeah. Let me know when you reach.

01:22:15.375 --> 01:22:17.083
Let me put the suitcase in.

01:22:22.583 --> 01:22:23.583
Amel,

01:22:24.875 --> 01:22:26.458
be careful over there.

01:22:28.791 --> 01:22:32.750
No matter what happens,
you'll always be my daughter.

01:22:41.458 --> 01:22:44.125
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you peace.

01:22:44.208 --> 01:22:45.375
Take care.

01:23:00.958 --> 01:23:02.083
Let's go.

01:23:02.166 --> 01:23:03.625
Let's visit Baitullah.

01:23:05.416 --> 01:23:09.875
I wish to go back there.

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:15.250
I miss Baitullah.

01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:23.291
Here I am, O Allah.

01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:27.958
Here I am.

01:23:30.416 --> 01:23:33.083
Here I am.

01:23:35.458 --> 01:23:37.291
You have no partner.

01:23:39.291 --> 01:23:41.541
Here I am.

01:23:43.875 --> 01:23:47.208
All praise, grace

01:23:47.291 --> 01:23:52.250
and sovereignty belong to you.

01:23:54.875 --> 01:23:57.041
You have no partner.

01:23:59.833 --> 01:24:01.666
Glory be to Allah.

01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:04.208
And praise be to Allah.

01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:08.541
There is no God but Allah.

01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:11.625
God is most great.

01:24:11.708 --> 01:24:16.000
Our Lord, give us

01:24:16.083 --> 01:24:19.333
good in this world

01:24:19.416 --> 01:24:23.333
and good in the hereafter

01:24:23.416 --> 01:24:26.875
and save us
from the punishment of the fire.

01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:44.083
Every believer

01:24:45.541 --> 01:24:50.458
will always miss their creator.

01:24:52.666 --> 01:24:56.416
Especially in moments when they feel lost

01:24:57.291 --> 01:24:58.458
and distant.

01:25:00.208 --> 01:25:01.458
Perhaps

01:25:03.375 --> 01:25:06.375
your longing for Allah right now

01:25:07.958 --> 01:25:10.666
could be his way

01:25:12.291 --> 01:25:17.125
to help you love yourself more.

01:25:23.458 --> 01:25:27.083
Allah will never

01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:30.958
abandon his believer.

01:25:43.583 --> 01:25:44.916
You've hurt me.

01:25:47.083 --> 01:25:50.208
Did you think
when you brought that woman here?

01:25:50.291 --> 01:25:52.541
Did you think about my feelings?

01:25:54.708 --> 01:25:56.125
I want a divorce.

01:25:58.958 --> 01:26:00.083
I'm so sorry,

01:26:01.083 --> 01:26:03.750
but you've just had a miscarriage.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.291
Why, Allah?

01:26:08.416 --> 01:26:10.500
Why?

01:26:12.208 --> 01:26:14.583
I accept your will, Allah.

01:26:16.375 --> 01:26:18.791
I accept Your will.

01:27:08.333 --> 01:27:11.375
At the Kaaba, every prayer is granted.

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:52.291
Barra, you've been
to this place before, right?

01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:55.416
Barra, have you been here?

01:27:57.333 --> 01:27:59.125
Where are we going after this?

01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:00.291
Barra?

01:28:36.708 --> 01:28:37.958
Barra, smile.

01:28:42.875 --> 01:28:44.375
Smile. Cut.

01:28:44.458 --> 01:28:47.833
-That's it? Smile wide.
-I'm done.

01:28:47.916 --> 01:28:50.291
-That's it?
-I'm tired.

01:28:50.375 --> 01:28:51.458
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Barra,

01:28:54.541 --> 01:28:56.208
our date isn't over yet.

01:28:56.791 --> 01:28:58.166
You want to call it a day?

01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:01.791
But we did so much today.

01:29:02.708 --> 01:29:03.875
It's enough.

01:29:03.958 --> 01:29:06.625
But I've prepared everything.

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:08.583
Everyone's waiting for us.

01:29:20.208 --> 01:29:21.458
Do you…

01:29:22.833 --> 01:29:24.666
actually want to marry me?

01:29:30.958 --> 01:29:32.708
What's with that question?

01:29:35.208 --> 01:29:37.250
It feels like you're distant.

01:29:41.708 --> 01:29:43.875
Are you still thinking about Amira?

01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:50.708
Amel…

01:29:53.541 --> 01:29:56.541
to be honest…

01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:01.250
I was trying to forget Amira…

01:30:03.708 --> 01:30:06.750
and commit to being with you.

01:30:09.416 --> 01:30:10.791
But I'm sorry, Amel.

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:12.583
I can't.

01:30:16.958 --> 01:30:20.625
We grew up together.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:25.958
And all this time,
you've always been good to me.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.208
You never once let me down.

01:30:32.375 --> 01:30:35.625
But once again, I'm sorry.

01:30:36.791 --> 01:30:38.750
I'm the one who let you down.

01:30:40.583 --> 01:30:42.583
We've travelled all this way…

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.500
just for you to say
you don't want to be with me?

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.000
Maybe it's true

01:30:57.291 --> 01:31:00.000
that there's nothing
we can hide in Baitullah.

01:31:01.583 --> 01:31:04.166
If we keep pushing this,

01:31:06.916 --> 01:31:09.208
I'm afraid you won't be happy with me.

01:31:10.583 --> 01:31:12.833
I'll only end up hurting you more.

01:31:39.666 --> 01:31:40.666
Barra…

01:31:43.833 --> 01:31:45.666
I love you.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.916
But by God's will, I've made my peace.

01:32:02.625 --> 01:32:04.000
Amira is here.

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:09.291
Please tell her

01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:13.041
that you still haven't forgotten her.

01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:20.875
Our relationship is over.

01:32:23.416 --> 01:32:24.500
Peace be upon you.

01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:28.875
And upon you peace
and God's mercy and blessings.

01:33:02.458 --> 01:33:05.041
-Peace be upon you.
-Upon you peace, Barra.

01:33:05.791 --> 01:33:07.541
Icha, is Amira in Mecca?

01:33:07.625 --> 01:33:10.250
Yes, she wanted to put her mind at ease.

01:33:10.333 --> 01:33:12.041
Where can I find her?

01:33:12.125 --> 01:33:15.625
If you're just going
to make her sad, don't bother.

01:33:40.291 --> 01:33:41.333
Amira.

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.583
Amira.

01:33:47.125 --> 01:33:48.583
Glory be to Allah.

01:33:59.041 --> 01:34:00.166
I…

01:34:02.583 --> 01:34:04.041
Amel and I are over.

01:34:07.333 --> 01:34:08.416
I'm sorry.

01:34:13.875 --> 01:34:17.583
today, in this holy land,

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.791
in Baitullah,

01:34:22.041 --> 01:34:25.958
let me be a part of your journey.

01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:29.916
To cherish

01:34:31.583 --> 01:34:32.833
and protect you.

01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:36.416
To be your partner

01:34:39.083 --> 01:34:42.291
both in this world and Allah's paradise.

01:34:46.916 --> 01:34:48.041
Amira Khadijah,

01:34:50.083 --> 01:34:51.375
will you…

01:34:52.916 --> 01:34:54.083
be my wife?

01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:34.833
What's your answer?

01:35:43.916 --> 01:35:45.416
Yes, I will be your wife.
