00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.375
That's enough, Dad. Go home.

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:01.458
Leave it to me and Yudhis.

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.958
I can do this.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.458
Please, Dad.

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.916
-Okay?
-Let's just go home, Dad.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.583
Let Saras handle it.

00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:19.500
Okay, fine. I'll go home.

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.166
Here, a dry shirt.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.833
Bye, Yudhis.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.833
Seriously?

00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:36.416
It was an accident.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.333
No, it wasn't!

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:39.333
Hey!

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.500
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY
FROM THE PODCAST LENTERA MALAM

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.541
Allahu akbar.

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:57.000
Sami allahu liman hamidah.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.083
Wake up.

00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:21.416
You stink. Go take a shower!

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:23.875
You missed, idiot.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.166
Coffee, Dad.

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:47.791
Saras!

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:50.041
The water's out again!

00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:01.291
Enjoy your meal, Dad.

00:04:05.916 --> 00:04:06.791
You look pale, Dad.

00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:09.083
Do you want to see a doctor?

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.583
I'm fine.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.583
It's better to spend the money
fixing the pump.

00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:30.875
Your health is more important.

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.708
The pump can wait.

00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:33.625
Let's go.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:36.750
Dad.

00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:44.291
Sweetie.

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:48.916
Am I weighing you down?

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.250
Of course not, Dad.

00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:54.583
Since Mom passed away,

00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:57.208
you've worked hard
so Yudhis and I could live well.

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:02.666
But…

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.666
I lost the restaurant.

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:14.583
The hardware store's closed.

00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:20.666
All my businesses failed.

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:25.250
All that's left is the car wash

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.750
that I can pass down to you.

00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:33.708
Sometimes, I wonder

00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:37.083
if I had--

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:40.833
"If I had been a good father to my kids."

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.541
-Right?
-Dhis.

00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:47.250
He says that once a week.
I've memorized it.

00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:56.916
When I die,

00:05:58.083 --> 00:06:04.416
I want to be buried in the village

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.583
where I was born.

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:12.625
I've also asked Uncle Setyo

00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:18.208
to bury me following Islamic customs.

00:06:18.916 --> 00:06:22.083
Of course.
What other faith is there to follow?

00:06:22.708 --> 00:06:24.250
Did you forget that you're Muslim?

00:06:26.416 --> 00:06:27.416
I'm kidding, Saras.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.333
Dad.

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:34.125
That's my will.

00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:38.291
Don't you want to be buried here
next to Mom?

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:41.458
She won't have anyone to talk to.

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:46.125
It's my turn to be serious.

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:49.625
I seriously have to go.

00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:53.333
Peace be upon you, Dad.

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:55.291
And upon you.

00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:56.250
Yudhis, wait.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:57.958
You go by taxi.

00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:03.458
You should rest up
if you're not feeling well.

00:07:03.541 --> 00:07:05.375
Yudhis and I can manage the car wash.

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:07.500
I'm okay.

00:07:08.583 --> 00:07:09.416
Yudhis!

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:13.375
Yudhis, wait!

00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:19.041
Dad.

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:21.750
Take it easy today.

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:32.708
There's still time.

00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:39.875
WARSITO CAR WASH

00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.125
WARSITO CAR WASH

00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:50.041
Saras.

00:07:50.125 --> 00:07:51.375
What?

00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:52.500
What does this mean?

00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:57.250
It means we have to go home early.

00:07:57.333 --> 00:07:58.416
Dad's cooking.

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:00.833
Let's close up and go home.

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:04.250
Are you serious?

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:08.000
We haven't made anything today
because we had no customers.

00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:12.000
A customer.

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.666
Hello. Just a wash or wash and wax?

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.833
A wash, please. How late are you open?

00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:24.791
Three of my friends are coming too.

00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:27.208
-We can handle it.
-We're open 24 hours today.

00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:29.541
-It's 24 hours? I'll tell my friends then.
-No worries.

00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:31.000
-Got it.
-Thanks.

00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:34.000
-You can leave your keys.
-Right.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.583
Your time is up.

00:11:03.458 --> 00:11:04.291
What's this?

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.875
Come on. Dad is waiting for us.

00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:14.916
Right.

00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:32.916
Peace be upon you, Dad.

00:11:33.583 --> 00:11:35.750
-Peace be upon you.
-Dad?

00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:37.291
Dinner.

00:11:44.625 --> 00:11:46.250
Dad?

00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:48.333
Yudhis.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.333
-Dad?
-Lift him up.

00:11:53.708 --> 00:11:55.583
Wake up, Dad. What happened?

00:11:56.458 --> 00:11:57.291
-Dad.
-Dad.

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:01.583
Dad.

00:12:03.208 --> 00:12:04.375
Dad.

00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:06.666
Wake up, Dad.

00:12:07.458 --> 00:12:10.250
Dad! Wake up.

00:12:10.333 --> 00:12:11.833
Dad!

00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:16.625
-Dad.
-Dad!

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.791
-Don't leave me, Dad!
-Dad!

00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:23.041
Don't leave us, Dad.

00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:43.666
Stay strong, okay?

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.125
-Stay strong.
-Dad's inside.

00:12:46.208 --> 00:12:47.041
I'll go in.

00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:53.708
So is Dad really gone?

00:12:57.541 --> 00:12:59.125
I thought--

00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:00.416
He's gone, Saras.

00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:04.750
Is he really, Yudhis?

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:05.666
Yes, Saras.

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:19.041
Let Dad go, Saras.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.125
It's so you won't feel suffocated.

00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.250
Dad wasn't feeling well,

00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:45.625
but he still made dinner.

00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.041
If we had gone to the doctor, he'd still--

00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:51.291
Saras.

00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:52.541
Let him go.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:54.791
Please?

00:13:56.416 --> 00:13:57.291
Let him go.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.500
Maybe we should respect Dad's will.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.333
Once a month, we visit Mom's grave.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.166
We pray for her together. You, Dad, and I.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.750
Just once a month.

00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:25.541
That's the only time
our family gets together.

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:30.583
But if Dad is buried in the village,

00:14:30.666 --> 00:14:32.333
we'll lose that tradition.

00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:36.208
When will we ever be together again

00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:39.000
now that they're gone?

00:14:39.083 --> 00:14:40.166
Saras, it's okay.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.500
Come on. Let's get some rest.

00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:45.250
Get ready for tomorrow.

00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:55.666
DATE OF BIRTH: FEBRUARY 17TH, 1973
DATE OF DEATH: JULY 10TH

00:14:56.708 --> 00:14:57.541
Yudhis.

00:14:58.416 --> 00:14:59.250
Uncle.

00:15:06.791 --> 00:15:07.666
Stay strong.

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:09.083
Thank you.

00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:12.041
Saras is inside.

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:16.666
The hearse is ready.
I'll need your help in a bit.

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:18.916
I'm going in.

00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:21.125
Okay.

00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:48.041
Rest in peace.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.291
I'll take good care of Saras and Yudhis.

00:16:21.625 --> 00:16:22.500
Saras.

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:24.708
Saras.

00:16:29.666 --> 00:16:30.625
Uncle Setyo.

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:40.708
Stay strong.

00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:55.083
Aunt Ambar and Dyah didn't come?

00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:58.250
They're waiting at home.

00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:00.375
Waiting?

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:08.458
I know it's tough for you,

00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:14.583
but we must hurry
and move your dad's body tonight.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:16.625
Tonight?

00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:17.541
Yes.

00:17:19.708 --> 00:17:20.541
Where will you take him to?

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:26.416
I'm not sure if your dad
mentioned it to you,

00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:32.500
but he asked me to bury him
in the village.

00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:40.125
He mentioned it before.

00:17:40.916 --> 00:17:43.125
-But I--
-The hearse is ready.

00:17:43.208 --> 00:17:44.791
-Let's get going--
-Uncle.

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:48.916
I plan to bury Dad in Surabaya,
next to Mom.

00:17:49.458 --> 00:17:51.916
But think about your dad.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.625
Uncle, Yudhis and I live here.

00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:56.416
I don't want to be away from him.

00:17:59.458 --> 00:18:03.416
It's your dad's will.
Don't take it lightly.

00:18:04.708 --> 00:18:07.250
Does he have to be buried in the village?

00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:11.458
-You must understand, Saras. Your dad--
-Uncle.

00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:12.791
I've made my decision.

00:18:14.208 --> 00:18:18.083
This is my family, my dad.
I have the final say.

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:24.416
I'm your family too, Saras. Your uncle.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.916
Your dad is my brother.

00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:29.750
Yudhis, talk to your sister.

00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:32.791
No, Uncle.

00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:35.458
I'm with Saras on this.

00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:42.250
You can go home if you disagree.

00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:43.500
I'm sorry, Uncle.

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:19.375
Allah Almighty has spoken the truth.

00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:26.916
-The body is alive.
-My goodness.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.208
It's awake.

00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:30.750
-What happened?
-The body is alive.

00:19:37.541 --> 00:19:39.583
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:44.916
Dad?

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.583
Dad?

00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:50.375
My goodness. Dad.

00:19:53.916 --> 00:19:56.375
Home.

00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:00.625
Dad?

00:20:01.666 --> 00:20:05.666
-My dad is picking me up.
-Dad?

00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:13.166
One lives,

00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:18.000
one dies.

00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:21.625
My gosh.

00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:23.583
-Dad?
-Dad.

00:20:24.666 --> 00:20:25.708
Dad?

00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:55.625
Dad?

00:21:12.708 --> 00:21:13.875
This is your fault.

00:21:55.458 --> 00:21:56.541
Dad!

00:22:00.333 --> 00:22:01.166
Dad!

00:22:04.666 --> 00:22:05.875
Yudhis!

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:07.458
Saras.

00:22:11.166 --> 00:22:12.083
Saras.

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:15.250
Dad is gone!

00:22:15.333 --> 00:22:16.833
But it's impossible.

00:22:43.333 --> 00:22:44.166
Mom!

00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:46.833
Mom!

00:22:47.708 --> 00:22:48.958
Mom!

00:22:49.041 --> 00:22:49.916
-What's wrong?
-Dad!

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.083
My gosh.

00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:53.791
Dear.

00:22:54.666 --> 00:22:55.500
Dear!

00:22:55.583 --> 00:22:56.458
Coming.

00:22:57.708 --> 00:22:58.875
What is that, dear?

00:23:04.208 --> 00:23:05.333
Get in.

00:23:05.416 --> 00:23:06.750
Can you say that again?

00:23:08.166 --> 00:23:09.666
I'm being serious.

00:23:10.458 --> 00:23:14.500
I thought it was a dream,
but I saw him walking.

00:23:14.583 --> 00:23:16.375
Someone must've moved him.

00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:17.791
I saw him walking.

00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:19.750
That's impossible!

00:23:20.958 --> 00:23:24.000
Okay. Let's get help.

00:23:24.791 --> 00:23:25.750
Let's find Dad.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:39.791
Uncle.

00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:41.625
Hello, Yudhis.

00:23:41.708 --> 00:23:43.125
It's me, Dyah.

00:23:50.875 --> 00:23:52.375
Uncle Hadi's body…

00:23:53.791 --> 00:23:56.083
His body is on our porch.

00:23:57.875 --> 00:23:58.833
What are you saying?

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.166
Wait.

00:24:07.166 --> 00:24:09.833
Saras, Dad is in Lamongan.

00:24:09.916 --> 00:24:11.458
How?

00:24:13.541 --> 00:24:15.500
We've been trying to reach you

00:24:16.875 --> 00:24:18.166
to let you know.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.416
Okay. We'll head over there now.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.333
Let's go, Yudhis.

00:24:39.458 --> 00:24:43.000
It's strange that Dad's body
ended up at Uncle Setyo's house.

00:24:45.208 --> 00:24:46.708
How did it get there?

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:52.750
Did Uncle really take Dad's body at night?

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.875
If it comes to this…

00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:12.208
This is my fault.

00:25:14.458 --> 00:25:17.166
I ignored Dad's will.

00:25:19.625 --> 00:25:20.708
Now I'm getting punished.

00:25:23.875 --> 00:25:28.541
What matters now is fulfilling his will.

00:25:28.625 --> 00:25:30.250
It doesn't have to be in Surabaya.

00:25:31.708 --> 00:25:33.208
The village is fine too.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.416
I just want to give Dad a burial.

00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:09.583
Saras.

00:26:39.708 --> 00:26:41.375
Saras, Yudhis.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.291
Did you take Dad's body?

00:26:48.375 --> 00:26:51.500
I told you, Saras. It's tradition
to do the burial in the village.

00:26:51.583 --> 00:26:54.333
Be honest! He couldn't just appear here.

00:26:55.166 --> 00:26:56.000
Saras.

00:26:56.666 --> 00:26:57.833
Saras.

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:59.875
It was I who found his body.

00:27:01.541 --> 00:27:05.083
After coming back from Surabaya,
he stayed with me all night.

00:27:08.666 --> 00:27:10.000
Peace be upon you.

00:27:10.083 --> 00:27:11.625
-And upon you peace, Ustad Zuhri.
-And upon you.

00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:15.916
Saras, Yudhis, this is Ustad Zuhri.
He will lead the tahlil prayer.

00:27:16.708 --> 00:27:19.125
These are Hadi's kids.
They're from Surabaya.

00:27:19.208 --> 00:27:20.250
Okay.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.916
This village isn't far from Surabaya,

00:27:39.333 --> 00:27:41.833
but the roads are pretty bad.

00:27:43.333 --> 00:27:44.541
Yes, Auntie.

00:27:46.041 --> 00:27:46.875
Yudhis.

00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:49.041
-Saras.
-Saras.

00:27:52.083 --> 00:27:53.166
Just lie down.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.041
I want to see Uncle.

00:27:56.083 --> 00:27:57.541
Take it easy.

00:27:59.375 --> 00:28:02.000
I'll help set things up
for tahlil prayers.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.541
Yudhis, stay with your sister.

00:28:12.833 --> 00:28:13.666
Saras.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.708
Take it easy.

00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:18.791
This was your old bedroom.

00:28:21.291 --> 00:28:22.583
It's a little different,

00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:28.125
but it still has the same bed.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.916
And the same wardrobe.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.583
Right.

00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:41.916
You lived here with Mom and Dad, right?

00:28:46.375 --> 00:28:48.541
Hearing you say that made me realize

00:28:49.916 --> 00:28:51.875
we no longer have our parents.

00:28:55.625 --> 00:28:56.458
Yudhis, Saras.

00:28:57.666 --> 00:28:58.916
I'll go help out my mom.

00:29:06.791 --> 00:29:07.958
Two nights have passed.

00:29:10.208 --> 00:29:11.041
Get some sleep, Saras.

00:29:25.125 --> 00:29:26.083
Who drew this?

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.333
Me.

00:29:32.166 --> 00:29:36.416
When Mom was pregnant with you,
we fought over your name.

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:39.291
Dad wanted Arga.

00:29:40.041 --> 00:29:41.583
I wanted Sakti.

00:29:43.583 --> 00:29:44.916
But after Mom passed,

00:29:45.875 --> 00:29:47.625
we picked the name she wanted.

00:29:50.583 --> 00:29:53.875
I was five when we moved to Surabaya.

00:29:54.541 --> 00:29:58.291
But I remember the good times we had here.

00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:01.333
At least

00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:05.666
you've got memories of Mom and this house.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:07.875
I have none.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:16.833
We moved to Surabaya because Mom
had issues while pregnant with you.

00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:19.791
Dad wanted to be sure

00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:22.791
that both you and Mom would be okay.

00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:26.166
But it didn't work out.

00:30:27.375 --> 00:30:29.875
I was born, and Mom died.

00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:32.083
Stop.

00:30:32.166 --> 00:30:34.458
Dad and I kept this to ourselves

00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:37.458
so you wouldn't blame yourself.

00:30:40.041 --> 00:30:40.958
It's too late.

00:30:42.916 --> 00:30:45.291
I already feel that way.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.833
Come on. Get to work.

00:31:01.916 --> 00:31:04.250
Now that's the sister I know.

00:31:05.208 --> 00:31:06.166
Quit acting weak.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.583
Take a shower.

00:31:08.125 --> 00:31:09.208
I'll do it later.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:10.833
Shower now.

00:31:23.666 --> 00:31:24.500
Weird, isn't it?

00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:29.750
But I like having people
cooking in the kitchen.

00:31:31.541 --> 00:31:33.625
I'm usually by myself.

00:31:35.166 --> 00:31:37.791
Dyah doesn't cook?

00:31:39.416 --> 00:31:40.791
Dyah is sick.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:43.625
She's sick?

00:31:45.291 --> 00:31:46.208
What illness?

00:31:47.458 --> 00:31:50.916
What was it called again? Leu…

00:31:52.083 --> 00:31:53.833
Leukemia.

00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:56.333
Blood cancer.

00:31:56.416 --> 00:31:57.500
Blood cancer.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.166
She shouldn't move around too much.

00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:04.125
Go rest if you're tired.

00:32:05.625 --> 00:32:07.916
No, Mom. I'm okay.

00:32:08.625 --> 00:32:10.041
Here.

00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:12.291
I got this.

00:32:12.375 --> 00:32:13.583
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

00:32:14.166 --> 00:32:15.833
Don't push yourself.

00:32:15.916 --> 00:32:17.333
Don't push yourself.

00:32:17.416 --> 00:32:18.958
I know.

00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:23.916
I wish

00:32:25.041 --> 00:32:27.458
the kitchen wasn't only busy
when there's a gathering.

00:32:30.166 --> 00:32:32.625
It's been so quiet here

00:32:33.916 --> 00:32:35.375
since you all moved to Surabaya.

00:32:37.166 --> 00:32:38.291
But your dad is back

00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:40.958
with such an unfortunate event.

00:32:43.625 --> 00:32:46.791
So how did Dad's body end up here?

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.500
Long ago,

00:33:12.833 --> 00:33:15.083
someone who was supernatural
used to live in this village.

00:33:17.333 --> 00:33:18.500
He knew black magic

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
that brought him blessings.

00:33:24.125 --> 00:33:24.958
But…

00:33:27.083 --> 00:33:30.125
this power came with a curse.

00:33:32.041 --> 00:33:32.875
A curse?

00:33:37.125 --> 00:33:38.416
He couldn't pass on,

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.166
stuck in the state of dying,

00:33:44.291 --> 00:33:45.500
unable to die.

00:33:50.333 --> 00:33:53.916
Is that why Dad's body came back here?

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:05.833
Your uncle knows this best.

00:34:07.583 --> 00:34:09.208
Come on. Just help me out.

00:34:41.625 --> 00:34:43.583
Look at what you did.

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.458
It's because you didn't respect my will.

00:34:48.083 --> 00:34:49.750
Help.

00:34:50.291 --> 00:34:51.791
Help.

00:34:51.875 --> 00:34:55.791
Help me!

00:34:55.875 --> 00:34:58.208
Help me!

00:34:59.375 --> 00:35:00.958
My gosh!

00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:03.541
Blood! Oh my god…

00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:06.250
My gosh.

00:35:11.041 --> 00:35:11.875
Uncle.

00:35:18.083 --> 00:35:19.208
Calm down.

00:35:20.458 --> 00:35:22.458
Ladies, gentlemen.

00:35:22.541 --> 00:35:24.208
Stop the prayer session.

00:35:25.083 --> 00:35:27.208
Let's wash the body again.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.833
What's wrong, sir?

00:35:52.375 --> 00:35:53.416
I can't stand it.

00:35:54.041 --> 00:35:56.541
Didn't this happen
during Mr. Rajiman's burial too?

00:35:57.291 --> 00:36:00.625
Dyah's grandpa?
His body was difficult to bury too.

00:36:00.708 --> 00:36:01.833
The same thing happened.

00:36:02.625 --> 00:36:03.541
It happens with Jiwo Warsito too.

00:36:03.625 --> 00:36:06.125
Hey, it happened 50 years ago.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:13.375
Please don't talk about it here.
Respect my brother.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.916
-Please.
-We'll go back first.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.958
Dad.

00:36:57.708 --> 00:37:01.333
Don't overthink it.

00:37:01.416 --> 00:37:02.833
Please. My family is mourning.

00:37:02.916 --> 00:37:06.333
I was just saying. I'm not sure either.

00:37:06.416 --> 00:37:08.500
But what if Hadi was practicing it?

00:37:08.583 --> 00:37:11.416
-I'll check what's going on.
-That's enough.

00:37:12.125 --> 00:37:14.708
We're trying to help the late Mr. Hadi.

00:37:27.333 --> 00:37:28.541
Saras.

00:37:37.083 --> 00:37:39.458
Saras.

00:39:01.958 --> 00:39:02.791
Saras.

00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:20.000
-Yudhis!
-Saras!

00:40:23.625 --> 00:40:24.958
Something's wrong here.

00:40:30.333 --> 00:40:31.541
Are you okay?

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:34.916
What happened to you?

00:40:36.541 --> 00:40:38.666
Did something happen to you too?

00:40:48.083 --> 00:40:49.791
Uncle, what's going on?

00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:55.750
So you heard from your aunt.

00:40:57.583 --> 00:41:00.625
The black magic was passed down
to your dad.

00:41:01.708 --> 00:41:03.291
But you should know.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.541
Those who inherit this magic
struggle to die

00:41:10.083 --> 00:41:11.666
if they don't let go of it.

00:41:17.833 --> 00:41:21.458
That's why, before the Islamic burial,

00:41:21.541 --> 00:41:25.208
something must be done to sever the magic.

00:41:26.708 --> 00:41:28.875
The burial must occur on a Kliwon Friday.

00:41:30.333 --> 00:41:33.583
I don't get what you're saying,
but that's not possible.

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:38.083
If I push Dad's funeral to Friday,

00:41:38.958 --> 00:41:40.666
that's still two days away.

00:41:44.791 --> 00:41:48.958
It started with your great-grandpa,

00:41:50.291 --> 00:41:52.083
then your grandpa, and now your dad.

00:41:57.541 --> 00:41:58.375
What are you saying?

00:41:59.458 --> 00:42:00.583
Nonsense.

00:42:00.666 --> 00:42:01.500
Yudhis.

00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:03.125
Saras.

00:42:04.666 --> 00:42:05.916
You must understand.

00:42:06.708 --> 00:42:10.625
If the black magic isn't severed,
it could pass on to one of you.

00:42:11.458 --> 00:42:13.333
Either Yudhis or Saras.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.583
Your dad knew his time was coming.

00:42:17.833 --> 00:42:19.916
Your businesses are going bankrupt, right?

00:42:21.125 --> 00:42:23.208
That means he needs a new successor.

00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:26.291
Your dad's will is to sever the magic.

00:42:27.791 --> 00:42:30.541
What happens
if the black magic isn't broken?

00:42:33.583 --> 00:42:35.000
One lives,

00:42:36.125 --> 00:42:37.416
one dies.

00:42:41.875 --> 00:42:44.416
The blessings come with a price.

00:42:47.833 --> 00:42:50.750
Your dad chose to inherit the magic

00:42:51.708 --> 00:42:53.625
to save you, Yudhis,

00:42:54.583 --> 00:42:56.333
when you almost died at birth.

00:43:00.625 --> 00:43:01.458
No.

00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:03.166
No, Auntie.

00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:07.666
-So Mom died because…
-No. Auntie.

00:43:09.166 --> 00:43:11.291
-Saras.
-Mom died from an illness,

00:43:12.208 --> 00:43:13.750
not some black magic
or anything like that.

00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:17.666
Let's go to bed, Yudhis.

00:43:18.291 --> 00:43:21.583
Saras. We have to bury your dad
on Kliwon Friday.

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:23.375
It's for your sake!

00:43:26.916 --> 00:43:28.125
Say "Mom" with me.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:29.875
You…

00:43:29.958 --> 00:43:31.666
One, two… Dad.

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.625
-On the count of three, say "Mom."
-Dad.

00:43:33.708 --> 00:43:34.875
One, two, three…

00:43:34.958 --> 00:43:37.250
-Mom.
-What if Uncle was telling the truth?

00:43:39.166 --> 00:43:40.375
That means I killed Mom.

00:43:44.458 --> 00:43:45.291
Yudhis.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.458
How can you say that? Of course not.

00:43:50.958 --> 00:43:52.125
But it's clear now.

00:43:53.166 --> 00:43:56.458
That explains all the strange happenings
since Dad died.

00:43:59.333 --> 00:44:01.125
Now we'll follow Dad's will.

00:44:01.791 --> 00:44:03.125
Bury him according to Islamic customs.

00:44:03.666 --> 00:44:05.000
No magic severance.

00:44:05.708 --> 00:44:07.000
No need to wait for Kliwon Friday.

00:44:19.125 --> 00:44:21.416
But if what Uncle Setyo says is true,

00:44:24.208 --> 00:44:26.166
then Dad has committed shirk.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:37.041
It's an unforgivable sin
in the eyes of God.

00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:40.083
And if it's true

00:44:42.208 --> 00:44:45.750
that it must be passed down to one of us,
it's between you and me.

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.958
What do we do?
Trust Uncle Setyo or follow Dad's will?

00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:55.291
Saras.

00:44:57.833 --> 00:44:58.916
I want to stay with Dad.

00:45:00.541 --> 00:45:01.500
Pray for him.

00:45:02.583 --> 00:45:04.333
I wasn't with him when he died.

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:18.708
My Lord, forgive me and my parents,
and have mercy on them

00:45:18.791 --> 00:45:21.125
as they brought me up when I was small.

00:45:25.833 --> 00:45:26.875
Hang in there, dear.

00:45:28.833 --> 00:45:32.541
We all believe you'll get better.

00:45:36.875 --> 00:45:41.041
You should go check on Saras and Yudhis.

00:45:43.125 --> 00:45:45.291
I feel sorry for them.

00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:49.583
They have to deal
with something like this.

00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:53.625
I miss the lively you.

00:45:54.958 --> 00:45:58.791
We know you'll survive.

00:45:59.416 --> 00:46:01.083
You'll be healthy again.

00:46:13.791 --> 00:46:16.125
Go to bed, Saras. It's late.

00:46:17.666 --> 00:46:18.500
Yeah.

00:47:45.291 --> 00:47:46.125
Yudhis.

00:47:46.833 --> 00:47:47.666
Yudhis.

00:47:48.916 --> 00:47:49.750
Yudhis.

00:47:52.125 --> 00:47:53.416
Yudhis!

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.708
Auntie!

00:47:58.416 --> 00:48:00.166
Auntie!

00:48:00.916 --> 00:48:01.750
Auntie!

00:48:11.833 --> 00:48:12.666
Yudhis.

00:48:24.541 --> 00:48:25.541
Yudhis.

00:48:26.375 --> 00:48:27.458
Are you okay?

00:48:27.541 --> 00:48:28.791
What's the matter?

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:31.000
-Yudhis.
-Go to bed, Saras.

00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:36.416
Please don't leave me, Yudhis.

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.166
Saras.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:45.666
Go to bed.

00:49:24.416 --> 00:49:26.583
Yudhis…

00:49:27.708 --> 00:49:33.791
Let's go home.

00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:44.125
Why won't you grant my wish?

00:49:44.208 --> 00:49:45.750
Auntie!

00:49:46.333 --> 00:49:48.041
Auntie!

00:50:00.333 --> 00:50:01.166
Saras.

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.083
Why are you screaming? It's late.

00:50:04.166 --> 00:50:05.125
What?

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:10.583
Yudhis.

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.333
-Are you okay?
-Why wouldn't I?

00:50:30.416 --> 00:50:31.291
Are you okay?

00:50:37.875 --> 00:50:38.708
Saras.

00:50:48.416 --> 00:50:49.625
So what do we do?

00:50:54.416 --> 00:50:57.208
Follow Uncle Setyo or Dad's will?

00:51:00.041 --> 00:51:02.208
Saras.

00:51:07.666 --> 00:51:08.750
It's raining.

00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:10.208
I know it's raining.

00:51:10.291 --> 00:51:12.000
-Is this another curse?
-We can't delay this any longer.

00:51:12.083 --> 00:51:14.916
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.333
Excuse me.

00:51:16.416 --> 00:51:18.041
You saw what happened last night.

00:51:18.125 --> 00:51:21.250
I don't want anything worse
to happen to Yudhis.

00:51:21.333 --> 00:51:23.375
I just want to give Dad a burial.

00:51:23.458 --> 00:51:25.250
It's been almost three days.

00:51:25.333 --> 00:51:27.541
It's raining, Saras. I told you.

00:51:27.625 --> 00:51:31.041
No! He will never find peace
if we keep delaying it!

00:51:31.125 --> 00:51:32.250
-Saras.
-It has to be done today.

00:51:32.791 --> 00:51:33.708
Calm down, Saras.

00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:39.541
We have to bury him on Kliwon Friday.

00:51:39.625 --> 00:51:40.916
That's the only way.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.125
Ustad!

00:51:44.041 --> 00:51:46.750
Islam says he should be buried
right away, right?

00:51:46.833 --> 00:51:48.166
We can't delay it any longer!

00:52:06.125 --> 00:52:07.541
There's blood, Ustad!

00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:09.125
-Blood?
-Ustad!

00:52:09.208 --> 00:52:10.583
My gosh.

00:52:11.541 --> 00:52:13.750
Look, it's the curse!

00:52:13.833 --> 00:52:15.250
We have to delay this, Ustad.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.750
Keep going!

00:52:18.833 --> 00:52:19.958
-Saras.
-Saras.

00:52:20.041 --> 00:52:21.375
-Keep going!
-Saras.

00:52:21.458 --> 00:52:23.125
Let's move. Come on.

00:52:23.208 --> 00:52:24.416
Saras!

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:25.333
Let's go.

00:52:37.291 --> 00:52:39.208
Please take the water out.

00:52:44.541 --> 00:52:46.375
Ustad. Let's start.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.833
Come on!

00:52:55.083 --> 00:52:57.750
-No way.
-My gosh.

00:52:57.833 --> 00:52:59.375
-What do we do?
-My gosh.

00:53:01.166 --> 00:53:03.083
-We can't continue like this!
-Calm down.

00:53:03.166 --> 00:53:05.166
-Are we going to dig it up again?
-Stay calm.

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:07.500
-Calm down.
-This is horrible.

00:53:07.583 --> 00:53:09.458
-God, have mercy.
-My gosh.

00:53:09.541 --> 00:53:10.875
Calm down.

00:53:10.958 --> 00:53:14.166
Saras, it looks like we have to wait.

00:53:16.625 --> 00:53:17.500
Saras.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.958
It's been three days, Uncle!

00:53:24.708 --> 00:53:27.791
It's been three days since he's gone!

00:53:40.625 --> 00:53:42.250
I keep failing, Yudhis.

00:53:42.333 --> 00:53:44.500
How will Dad find peace?

00:53:44.583 --> 00:53:46.166
How will we…

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:48.041
We'll find a way.

00:53:56.625 --> 00:53:57.500
Eat something, Saras.

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:03.625
We'll be in trouble if you get sick.

00:54:05.541 --> 00:54:07.750
We're burying Dad tomorrow.

00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:14.500
What if something happens tomorrow

00:54:15.416 --> 00:54:17.708
and we still can't bury him?

00:54:18.916 --> 00:54:20.208
Don't say that.

00:54:21.916 --> 00:54:22.916
How?

00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:26.416
I keep failing to carry out his will.

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:31.291
Me too, Saras.

00:54:33.125 --> 00:54:34.750
I failed as his son.

00:55:06.833 --> 00:55:10.333
Maybe nobody came because they were tired.

00:55:11.291 --> 00:55:12.250
It was raining hard.

00:55:13.541 --> 00:55:14.833
I hope so.

00:55:17.458 --> 00:55:18.416
Poor Dad.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.916
No one prayed for him.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.250
It's your responsibility to pray for him.

00:55:24.208 --> 00:55:25.083
What do you mean?

00:55:26.291 --> 00:55:28.458
For the dead,

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.375
their sins can be erased
by continuous charity

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.583
and prayers from their pious children.

00:55:37.583 --> 00:55:39.708
Don't overthink it.

00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:41.708
Yes, Ustad.

00:55:42.583 --> 00:55:44.125
I should get going.

00:55:45.625 --> 00:55:46.750
Of course, Ustad.

00:55:53.625 --> 00:55:54.458
Ustad.

00:55:56.125 --> 00:55:57.791
Thank you for accompanying us.

00:55:57.875 --> 00:55:59.291
You didn't have to.

00:55:59.375 --> 00:56:00.791
Send my regards to your wife.

00:56:02.208 --> 00:56:03.166
See you.

00:56:04.541 --> 00:56:06.916
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you.

00:56:19.958 --> 00:56:21.000
I think

00:56:23.291 --> 00:56:26.416
the locals suspect your dad
was practicing black magic.

00:56:28.333 --> 00:56:30.083
That's why nobody came.

00:56:54.208 --> 00:56:57.958
So do we really have to bury Dad
on Kliwon Friday?

00:56:58.708 --> 00:56:59.958
That's right.

00:57:01.041 --> 00:57:05.791
But there's something
we must do before that.

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:08.291
What is it, Uncle?

00:57:16.625 --> 00:57:17.458
The way

00:57:18.916 --> 00:57:20.916
to sever the black magic.

00:57:24.875 --> 00:57:30.208
One lives, one dies.

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:38.041
Your family's blood has sealed the pact.

00:57:39.041 --> 00:57:43.625
I've kept my promise to your father.

00:57:44.541 --> 00:57:48.166
Now it's your turn to keep yours.

00:57:48.958 --> 00:57:53.833
One of you must go with me.

00:57:53.916 --> 00:57:58.000
Die. In hell, burned by fire.

00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:03.875
I came to collect a soul.

00:58:15.083 --> 00:58:16.791
We don't have much time.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.083
Don't be scared, Saras.

00:59:24.083 --> 00:59:27.791
The grave collapsed yesterday.
What's next?

00:59:27.875 --> 00:59:30.125
It has to be because
he practiced black magic.

00:59:30.208 --> 00:59:31.500
I think you're right. After all…

00:59:34.916 --> 00:59:35.958
What's that noise?

00:59:37.125 --> 00:59:40.250
It's like something is rustling.

00:59:42.958 --> 00:59:43.791
Hey.

00:59:44.875 --> 00:59:46.083
From there?

00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:47.083
I don't know.

00:59:49.791 --> 00:59:51.958
-Gosh.
-My gosh.

00:59:57.125 --> 00:59:58.666
My gosh.

00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:59.875
What's that?

01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:10.333
We'll share this with the neighbors
so they won't get suspicious.

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:13.875
Uncle.

01:00:18.208 --> 01:00:19.041
Is this

01:00:20.041 --> 01:00:21.333
really the only way?

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:26.458
Saras. How about splitting up
to make it quick?

01:00:27.083 --> 01:00:27.916
Okay?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.666
-I'll go over there.
-Okay.

01:00:32.416 --> 01:00:33.250
Saras.

01:00:34.791 --> 01:00:35.666
I'll go here.

01:00:50.791 --> 01:00:53.541
Is that for the corpse?

01:00:57.833 --> 01:00:58.666
Don't.

01:00:59.208 --> 01:01:00.500
You'll get sick.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:03.541
I'm only ill, not dying.

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:04.916
I can still help.

01:01:11.875 --> 01:01:12.708
Wait.

01:01:13.625 --> 01:01:14.916
I've been wondering.

01:01:16.375 --> 01:01:17.291
Is my dad

01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:21.458
the only one
who's had his burial delayed like this?

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.750
No one else in the village had,

01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:31.916
but Grandpa Rajiman's was like this too.

01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:38.375
Why did you ask?

01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:46.250
What?

01:01:48.791 --> 01:01:49.625
Yudhis.

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:53.291
Dyah.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.041
Do you have Grandpa Rajiman's Yasin book?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.958
Yeah, in the storage room.

01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:03.250
Along with the Yasin books
from our ancestors.

01:02:08.166 --> 01:02:09.125
What's the matter?

01:02:14.583 --> 01:02:15.458
Can I see it?

01:03:50.541 --> 01:03:52.833
It's all on Suro 14th.

01:05:11.916 --> 01:05:12.750
Dad.

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:23.583
Open up!

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.916
Open up!

01:05:32.166 --> 01:05:33.375
Open up.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.625
Where were you when I died?

01:05:59.541 --> 01:06:03.333
Where were you when I died?

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:09.833
I was born from fire.

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:14.583
You, from the earth.

01:06:15.833 --> 01:06:18.875
I've fulfilled your wishes.

01:06:20.833 --> 01:06:24.208
Your ancestors were my slaves.

01:06:25.458 --> 01:06:30.916
Now it's your turn.

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.583
Dyah, help me!

01:06:35.416 --> 01:06:36.250
Help!

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.708
Help me.

01:06:55.375 --> 01:06:56.208
Help!

01:07:02.791 --> 01:07:03.666
Open up!

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:04.958
Dyah, help me!

01:07:05.041 --> 01:07:07.833
Open, please! Dyah!

01:07:07.916 --> 01:07:08.958
What?

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:43.583
Auntie!

01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:45.916
-Saras?
-Saras?

01:07:48.291 --> 01:07:49.125
Saras.

01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:51.708
Saras.

01:07:59.166 --> 01:08:00.208
What's wrong?

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:05.916
You've been chosen as the heir.

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:20.625
What's wrong with you, Yudhis?

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.458
Nothing.

01:08:22.541 --> 01:08:24.333
But you were screaming in there.

01:08:24.916 --> 01:08:25.750
Forget it.

01:08:26.625 --> 01:08:27.458
You…

01:08:27.541 --> 01:08:28.375
Saras.

01:08:30.875 --> 01:08:31.708
Yudhis.

01:08:33.791 --> 01:08:34.625
Saras.

01:08:38.291 --> 01:08:40.375
Suro 14th.

01:08:41.458 --> 01:08:43.125
They all died on Suro 14th.

01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:46.208
Uncle never told us about this.

01:08:48.208 --> 01:08:49.541
Something's not adding up.

01:08:52.291 --> 01:08:55.625
We'll bury Dad on Kliwon Friday.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:57.833
Saras.

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:02.500
We'll follow Dad's will.
You said that before.

01:09:02.583 --> 01:09:05.916
We'll bury him
according to Islamic customs.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.791
We tried. And it failed every time.

01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:10.333
-No, Saras.
-Then what should I do?

01:09:10.416 --> 01:09:11.666
No. No way.

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:14.166
I don't believe that.

01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:26.125
This is your fault, Yudhis.

01:09:32.666 --> 01:09:33.791
What are you saying?

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:42.458
How does it feel knowing
you're the cause of Mom's death?

01:09:49.208 --> 01:09:50.041
Saras.

01:09:51.041 --> 01:09:52.458
Do you realize

01:09:53.458 --> 01:09:55.541
that if you weren't born…

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:56.666
Saras.

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:59.666
…your mother, your father,

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:04.000
and your sister
could have lived happily without you?

01:10:09.166 --> 01:10:13.875
For centuries,
your family has been my home.

01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:16.375
This village.

01:10:16.958 --> 01:10:19.750
The blood in your sister's body.

01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:24.375
Your family's legacy will be a curse

01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:26.250
for your descendants.

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:32.458
Everyone

01:10:34.291 --> 01:10:35.875
will die.

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:39.916
Your father, your mother.

01:10:42.791 --> 01:10:43.625
Saras!

01:10:44.166 --> 01:10:45.750
Saras.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.166
Saras.

01:10:48.708 --> 01:10:50.791
-Saras!
-Saras!

01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:52.083
Saras!

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.916
Saras!

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.250
Let him go!

01:10:57.875 --> 01:11:01.541
No! Let go! Saras!

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:02.625
Saras.

01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:04.958
-Saras.
-Saras!

01:11:06.083 --> 01:11:07.708
-Let him go!
-Saras!

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:20.333
Dad!

01:11:22.208 --> 01:11:23.208
Saras.

01:11:23.958 --> 01:11:24.791
Dyah.

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:28.916
Yudhis.

01:11:39.916 --> 01:11:40.750
Dyah.

01:12:01.666 --> 01:12:02.500
Excuse me.

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:04.708
-Sorry to bother you.
-What?

01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:07.291
Can I ask you a favor?

01:12:07.375 --> 01:12:08.458
No.

01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:29.083
Sir, ma'am. Excuse me.

01:12:29.166 --> 01:12:31.250
You damn heretic family!

01:12:31.333 --> 01:12:32.250
Let's go inside.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.500
-Miss.
-Don't talk to me.

01:12:47.916 --> 01:12:49.291
What is this, Uncle?

01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:56.500
What's going to happen to me?

01:12:57.125 --> 01:12:58.250
I'm sorry, Saras.

01:12:58.333 --> 01:12:59.583
I have no choice.

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:06.500
Your dad did this to save Yudhis.

01:13:08.125 --> 01:13:10.083
Now I'm doing it for Dyah.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.791
She's critical. There's no hope.

01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:19.000
Yudhis.

01:13:19.083 --> 01:13:20.291
Yudhis.

01:13:21.208 --> 01:13:24.583
Sir, please wait. Can I ask for a favor?

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:25.500
Sir.

01:13:28.458 --> 01:13:29.625
Let me go.

01:13:30.291 --> 01:13:34.083
I couldn't make my own child happy.

01:13:34.166 --> 01:13:35.875
Let me go, Uncle.

01:13:38.291 --> 01:13:39.208
I'm sorry, Saras.

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.541
Dyah!

01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:46.333
Help me, Dyah!

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:49.666
Dyah!

01:13:51.166 --> 01:13:52.916
Help me, Dyah!

01:13:56.541 --> 01:13:57.833
Help me, Dyah!

01:13:57.916 --> 01:13:59.916
-Mom?
-Forgive me.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.083
Forgive me, Dyah.

01:14:01.166 --> 01:14:03.500
What's happening? Mom.

01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:06.208
We're doing this for your sake.

01:14:07.125 --> 01:14:10.333
We just want you to be healthy.

01:14:19.125 --> 01:14:20.875
Help me, Dyah!

01:14:28.458 --> 01:14:30.291
Yudhis.

01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:32.500
-Where are you going?
-Ustad.

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:35.500
What's wrong?

01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:38.458
I need your help, Ustad. It's my sister.

01:14:40.083 --> 01:14:41.583
-She's been dragged into a ritual.
-A ritual?

01:14:41.666 --> 01:14:44.041
-Please help, Ustad.
-Let's go.

01:14:51.916 --> 01:14:56.083
A long time ago,
the villagers made a pact with spirits.

01:14:56.166 --> 01:15:01.041
Then Sunan arrived to give their blessings
and everything returned to normal.

01:15:01.125 --> 01:15:03.375
Unless someone passes on the black magic.

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:07.583
What about my grandpa's burial, Rajiman?

01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:12.541
There was a weird incident,
but there was no proof of black magic.

01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:14.250
So it was just gossip.

01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:16.625
Come on.

01:15:16.708 --> 01:15:17.625
Wait, Ustad.

01:15:21.125 --> 01:15:23.750
What is this?
I found it near Dad's corpse.

01:15:25.375 --> 01:15:26.416
Kanthil flower.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.708
It's used to call spirits.

01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:30.666
Someone messed with your dad's corpse.

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:32.125
-Come on.
-Okay.

01:15:33.375 --> 01:15:34.708
This isn't right, Uncle.

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:38.500
I'll help you if that's what you want,

01:15:38.583 --> 01:15:39.875
but not like this!

01:15:41.125 --> 01:15:43.083
We'll find the solution together.

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:46.041
-Uncle.
-I had to make

01:15:46.958 --> 01:15:48.250
Hadi come back.

01:15:50.916 --> 01:15:54.500
I summoned the black magic
inside your dad's body

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:56.416
with a kanthil flower.

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.875
So you couldn't bury him.

01:15:59.958 --> 01:16:02.916
So you wouldn't inherit
the black magic right away.

01:16:04.833 --> 01:16:08.333
I needed time to perform this ritual

01:16:08.416 --> 01:16:11.541
even though our family
has never done it before.

01:16:11.625 --> 01:16:15.416
I had to dirty his corpse with blood.

01:16:15.958 --> 01:16:18.500
I had to try everything

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:21.541
to delay the burial,

01:16:22.166 --> 01:16:24.458
so you'd inherit the black magic,

01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:27.500
and I could perform this ritual.

01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:24.333
-Dyah.
-Yudhis.

01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:26.291
-Yudhis.
-Are you okay?

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:27.833
-What's wrong?
-Yudhis.

01:17:27.916 --> 01:17:29.625
Please help Saras.

01:17:29.708 --> 01:17:30.916
-I brought Ustad.
-My parents.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:31.833
Calm her down.

01:17:31.916 --> 01:17:33.916
-Yes.
-My parents are trying to hurt Saras.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.250
-Let's go, Ustad.
-Yudhis.

01:17:40.833 --> 01:17:41.833
Hey, you heretic family!

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:45.666
-Hypocrite!
-Everyone, please settle down.

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:46.958
Your family is still

01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:48.416
-practicing black magic?
-Calm down.

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:50.666
The people here could face punishment.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:51.958
-Calm down.
-That's right.

01:17:52.041 --> 01:17:54.375
-Damn you, Yudhis!
-Calm down!

01:18:01.958 --> 01:18:03.666
Uncle, don't do this.

01:18:05.625 --> 01:18:08.833
Then I can take that magic from you.

01:18:08.916 --> 01:18:10.541
Dyah!

01:18:10.625 --> 01:18:12.166
To save Dyah.

01:18:13.583 --> 01:18:16.166
But this isn't right, Uncle.

01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:18.500
We can find the solution together.

01:18:18.583 --> 01:18:19.708
Let me go.

01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:21.000
Which means,

01:18:21.083 --> 01:18:23.291
as the vessel of this magic, you must die

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.416
so I can take it from you.

01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:29.875
Please.

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:31.791
Don't do this, Uncle.

01:18:52.291 --> 01:18:54.416
Stop it! Silence!

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.666
Yudhis is asking for help.

01:18:57.750 --> 01:19:02.666
This problem will never end
if you continue doing this.

01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:09.875
Now I ask all of you to go to the mosque

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:13.458
and perform the funeral prayer
for the late Mr. Hadi.

01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:17.666
-What are you saying?
-What is this nonsense?

01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:20.875
Go now.

01:19:20.958 --> 01:19:22.791
-Please, everyone.
-Wait.

01:19:23.791 --> 01:19:24.875
Now.

01:19:51.666 --> 01:19:52.500
Dear.

01:19:54.708 --> 01:19:58.541
Dear.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:13.833
Dear.

01:20:14.708 --> 01:20:15.541
Dear!

01:20:49.041 --> 01:20:50.458
I'm sorry.

01:21:08.166 --> 01:21:09.166
I'm sorry.

01:21:17.416 --> 01:21:18.666
I'm sorry.

01:21:21.291 --> 01:21:23.416
It's all my fault…

01:21:35.416 --> 01:21:40.916
I pray for the deceased,
Hadi Warsito, the son of Rajiman,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:47.291
with four takbirs as an obligation
in the role of an Imam, for Allah.

01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:49.333
Allahu akbar.

01:21:49.416 --> 01:21:53.291
-Allahu akbar.
-Allahu akbar.

01:21:54.791 --> 01:21:55.625
Saras.

01:22:03.541 --> 01:22:04.750
Saras.

01:22:07.208 --> 01:22:13.583
Those who ask to be my servant

01:22:15.916 --> 01:22:21.666
must be prepared to die by fire.

01:22:25.583 --> 01:22:26.541
Dad!

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:43.750
Dear.

01:22:50.708 --> 01:22:52.500
-Mom!
-Dyah, no.

01:22:56.166 --> 01:22:57.250
-Mom!
-Dyah.

01:23:00.958 --> 01:23:02.208
Recite all the prayers you know.

01:23:07.833 --> 01:23:08.958
No, don't.

01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:11.500
I seek refuge with God from the devil.

01:23:11.583 --> 01:23:14.166
In God's name,
Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:16.875
Praise be to God, Lord of all worlds.

01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:18.458
The Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

01:23:18.541 --> 01:23:20.458
Master of the Day of Judgment.

01:23:20.541 --> 01:23:22.208
You alone we worship,

01:23:22.291 --> 01:23:23.208
-and You alone we ask for help.
-Ustad.

01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:25.125
-Guide us on the Straight Path.
-Wait here.

01:23:25.208 --> 01:23:28.041
The path of those
who have received Your grace,

01:23:28.125 --> 01:23:29.791
-not those You are displeased with
-Saras.

01:23:29.875 --> 01:23:32.041
-or those gone astray.
-Saras.

01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:33.666
In God's name,
Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:36.625
-There is no God but Him, the Eternal.
-I'll help.

01:23:36.708 --> 01:23:38.875
-He never gets tired or sleeps.
-Help.

01:23:38.958 --> 01:23:41.250
Everything in the heavens
and the earth belongs to Him.

01:23:41.333 --> 01:23:44.291
Who is it that can intercede with Him
except by His permission?

01:23:44.375 --> 01:23:46.916
He knows what is before them
and what will be after them.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.500
And they encompass not a thing
of His knowledge except for what He wills.

01:23:50.583 --> 01:23:53.250
His Seat extends
over the heavens and the earth,

01:23:53.333 --> 01:23:56.541
and their preservation tires Him not.
He is the Most Great.

01:23:56.625 --> 01:23:58.000
My gosh.

01:24:01.958 --> 01:24:03.541
In God's name,
Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

01:24:03.625 --> 01:24:04.958
-Say, "He is Allah, who is One,
-Help me.

01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:06.500
-Allah, the Eternal Refuge.
-Wake up, Saras.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:08.958
He neither begets nor is born.

01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:10.375
-Nor is there to Him any equivalent."
-Saras.

01:24:11.375 --> 01:24:12.916
In God's name,
Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.291
Have you forgotten your ancestors' past?

01:24:21.208 --> 01:24:23.916
And from the evil of an envier
when he envies.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.625
In God's name,
Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

01:24:25.708 --> 01:24:27.125
Say, "I seek refuge
in the Lord of mankind.

01:24:27.208 --> 01:24:29.833
The Sovereign of mankind.
The God of mankind.

01:24:29.916 --> 01:24:31.708
From the evil of the retreating whisperer.

01:24:31.791 --> 01:24:34.291
Who whispers evil
into the breasts of mankind.

01:24:34.375 --> 01:24:35.708
-From among the jinn and mankind."
-Saras.

01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:41.208
In God's name,
Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

01:24:41.291 --> 01:24:46.583
-O' assembly of jinn and humans!
-Saras!

01:24:46.666 --> 01:24:49.583
If you can penetrate beyond the realms
of the heavens and the earth.

01:24:50.166 --> 01:24:57.166
Then do so, you will not pass
without Our authority.

01:24:58.958 --> 01:25:01.291
-Saras!
-I take refuge with Allah's Perfect Words

01:25:01.375 --> 01:25:05.958
-You're destined to die.
-from the evils of all He has created.

01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:09.583
Stop, Saras!
That's Yudhis, your little brother!

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:15.291
-There is no God but Allah.
-There is no God but Allah.

01:25:15.375 --> 01:25:17.750
-There is no God but Allah.
-There is no God but Allah.

01:25:17.833 --> 01:25:22.291
I take refuge with Allah's Perfect Words
from the evils of all that He has created.

01:25:22.375 --> 01:25:26.458
-There is no God but Allah.
-I take refuge with Allah's Perfect Words

01:25:26.541 --> 01:25:28.125
-There is no God but Allah.
-from the evils of all He has created.

01:25:28.208 --> 01:25:31.583
There is no God but Allah, and I bear
witness that Muhammad is the Messenger.

01:25:39.291 --> 01:25:40.375
My gosh.

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.000
Saras.

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:48.083
Saras.

01:25:49.666 --> 01:25:50.500
Saras.

01:25:51.333 --> 01:25:52.166
Saras.

01:26:00.583 --> 01:26:01.416
Saras.

01:26:09.041 --> 01:26:09.958
Saras.

01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:13.875
Wake up, Saras.

01:26:21.083 --> 01:26:26.416
Indeed, God promised you the true promise.

01:26:27.375 --> 01:26:31.250
And I also promised you,
but I betrayed you.

01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:37.166
I had no authority over you

01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:43.375
except that I called you,
and you responded to me.

01:26:44.375 --> 01:26:50.125
So do not blame me, but blame yourselves.

01:26:50.208 --> 01:26:51.583
Get down, Dad.

01:26:51.666 --> 01:26:55.541
I cannot save you,

01:26:55.625 --> 01:27:00.083
nor can you save me.

01:27:01.708 --> 01:27:08.541
Indeed, I deny your association of me,
with Allah, before.

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:13.375
Indeed, for the wrongdoers

01:27:13.458 --> 01:27:17.583
is a painful punishment.

01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:22.041
I take refuge with Allah's Perfect Words
from the evils of all that He has created.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:27.750
I take refuge with Allah's Perfect Words
from the evils of all that He has created.

01:27:28.541 --> 01:27:32.625
I take refuge with Allah's Perfect Words
from the evils of all that He has created.

01:27:33.541 --> 01:27:38.541
There is no God but Allah, and I bear
witness that Muhammad is the Messenger.

01:27:38.625 --> 01:27:40.666
God is the Greatest!

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:44.250
-Dad.
-Dad.

01:28:09.875 --> 01:28:12.083
Saras, Yudhis.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.666
Carry your dad while reciting Shahada.

01:28:32.208 --> 01:28:33.166
Mom.

01:28:35.125 --> 01:28:37.041
Mom.

01:28:43.166 --> 01:28:50.166
I bear witness
that there is no God but Allah,

01:28:53.666 --> 01:29:00.666
and I bear witness that Muhammad
is the Messenger of Allah.

01:29:38.958 --> 01:29:40.416
I've made peace, Dad.

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.666
Rest in peace, Dad.

01:30:09.416 --> 01:30:10.458
Dyah.

01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:41.000
I don't know what to do, Saras.

01:30:49.458 --> 01:30:52.250
I don't have anyone now.

01:30:56.541 --> 01:30:57.375
Dyah.

01:30:58.958 --> 01:31:01.375
You have me and Yudhis.

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:04.458
Okay?

01:31:22.416 --> 01:31:23.333
Let's go.

01:31:24.208 --> 01:31:25.041
Let's go.

01:31:30.166 --> 01:31:31.416
Give it here. I'll carry it.
