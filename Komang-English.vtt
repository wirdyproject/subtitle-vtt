Komang! Hurry, we're gonna be late!

Let's take a shortcut.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.333
The one that passes the beach?
Is it faster?

5
00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:29.375
Just follow me.

[indistinct chatter]

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:55.333
[kid] This garbage is from Java.

8
00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.541
But it's polluting our beach.

9
00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:03.333
I want to go to Java.

10
00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:06.583
I could become a musician or an artist.

11
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.166
Right.

12
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:12.750
They say this garbage
will drift back to Java.

13
00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:15.833
Maybe you can get a free ride with it.

00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:20.250
Hey, garbage!
Bring my little brother along!

Hey. I'd probably be whale dinner.

I'm just heading out with Komang.

Komang!

You know how teens are.

-Someone is going on a date.
-Yes.

Where are we going?

34

I'll take you to a place

Mom, I'm going out for a bit.

[comedian] I'm mad at my grandma.

39
00:04:06.416 --> 00:04:07.708
She's keeping a duck,

40
00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:10.208
and she loves it more than me.

41
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.375
She said,

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:14.208
"I take care of the duck
so it's healthy and lays eggs,

43

and you can have the eggs.

You wanna swap?

[comedian 2] The second child
is so unlucky,

48
00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:28.625
always getting
the first child's leftovers.

49
00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:30.291
I thought I had it the worst,

50
00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.541
but my fifth younger sibling is worse off.

51
00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:35.333
The clothes they wear
were handed down so many times,

the Adidas shirt was reduced
to just the letter "A."

I'm originally from Wangi-wangi,

So which one is it?

59
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.750
Am I fragrant or stinky?

No, thanks.

Not you, I'm talking
to the lady over there.

You're way too cocky.

Whoo! They're gorgeous.

Yeah, I guess.

Although that Raim guy
was the only one who was funny.

That's all right.

don't play with me.

You're hilarious.
You own the stage and the crowd.

of going to Jakarta.

Once I've made it,
finding a girl won't be hard.

No, it's nothing.

It's not free?

-How could you?
-Pay for it! It's their income.

Should I spit it out?

It's okay, it's free.

Exactly! [chuckling]

That's really cheap.

Hey, Raim.

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.041
Good luck.

[bright music playing]

153

[Ode] Since I…

154
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.666
asked for your food,

155
00:08:32.666 --> 00:08:33.500
can I

156
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.583
also ask… for your number?

157
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:41.625
Sure.

158
00:08:44.833 --> 00:08:47.458
Sorry. Let me hold that for you.

[deep breaths]

160
00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.458
This is my dad's number.

Huh?

162
00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.416
Is this okay?

163
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.958
[chuckles] It used to be his.

164
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.750
[chuckling] Oh.

165
00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:05.916
So now it's your number?

166
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.625
It'd be awkward if I called
and your dad picked up.

167
00:09:08.708 --> 00:09:10.000
What would I say?

168
00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:11.750
Should I ask for more laklak?

00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:13.000
It would be funny.

Are you serious?

I'm sorry, I didn't know…

I'm just kidding. [chuckling]

174
00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:24.833
So he's still alive?

175
00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.000
He passed away. But that's my number.

I need your advice.

Does he want to polish the streets?

Maybe.

I'm busy here.

No.

It's a friend I haven't introduced you to.

But it's strange,
it's a little empty today.

Just one guest.

What's your name?

Komang Ade.

-Oh, Komang Ade.

I see.

This is Keraton Fort,

242
00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:18.041
the largest fort in the world.

243
00:13:18.125 --> 00:13:21.708
It's an Indonesian fort
that was built by the locals

244
00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:23.291
of the Buton Sultanate.

Miss Komang Ade,

246
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:30.875
do you know who normally constructs forts?

Perhaps.

00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:53.375
I've been wondering,
what do La Ode and Wa Ode mean?

257
00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.375
It's simple.

258
00:13:56.125 --> 00:13:58.916
"La" means men, "Wa" means women,

259
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and "Ode" means overdose.

260

-I'm being serious!

Okay, okay.

262
00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:09.958
Ode is a title of nobility in Buton.

263
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.500
There's La Ode and Wa Ode.

264
00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:15.250
La means La ilaha illallah,

265
00:14:15.916 --> 00:14:18.583
and Wa means Wa asyhadu
anna muhammadar rasulullah.

266
00:14:19.416 --> 00:14:22.791
So Buton's people carry both God's
and the prophet's names.

That's it?

Yeah, that's it. The third child.

271

504
00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:56.291
Om swastiastu.

505
00:29:57.875 --> 00:30:02.041
Sorry I'm late,
I was looking after my kid.

506
00:30:02.125 --> 00:30:03.208
No worries.

507
00:30:04.875 --> 00:30:07.500
In Bali, we'd make a pork lawar.

508
00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:11.291
I checked the market earlier,
but they didn't have it.

509
00:30:11.916 --> 00:30:13.708
It's hard to find here.

510
00:30:14.333 --> 00:30:16.500
Squid lawar is good as well.

511
00:30:16.583 --> 00:30:19.666
Not everyone is able to eat pork lawar.

512
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.041
It'll taste especially great
if it's Kadek's cooking.

513
00:30:25.041 --> 00:30:26.750
Thank you.

514
00:30:39.333 --> 00:30:40.458
It's done.

515
00:30:43.125 --> 00:30:46.083
Arya was supposed to be
your future son-in-law.

516
00:30:46.166 --> 00:30:50.041
He's kind, handsome, successful,

517
00:30:50.125 --> 00:30:51.916
and he's like a brother.

518
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.291
Not Raim.

519
00:30:54.583 --> 00:30:57.750
They're just friends.
It's nothing serious.

520
00:30:57.833 --> 00:31:01.541
How can it be friendship
when they're always together everywhere?

521
00:31:01.625 --> 00:31:05.250
Warn Komang to not end up like Kadek

522
00:31:05.333 --> 00:31:08.208
before it's too late.

523
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:10.666
If you pass away,

524
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.791
who's going to take care
of your Ngaben ceremony?

525
00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:17.541
Auntie, where are the flowers?

526
00:31:18.541 --> 00:31:21.125
In the kitchen, on the bottom shelf.

527
00:31:21.208 --> 00:31:22.625
Just have a look there.

528
00:31:22.708 --> 00:31:23.666
-Okay.
-Thanks.

529
00:31:32.958 --> 00:31:34.291
How is it?

530
00:31:35.041 --> 00:31:37.958
This lawar is as lovely as you, Komang.

531
00:31:38.666 --> 00:31:41.916
Mom. I can't believe
you're comparing me to squid lawar!

532
00:31:42.833 --> 00:31:45.000
I'm a dolphin, not a squid.

533
00:31:45.458 --> 00:31:49.083
There's no such thing as dolphin lawar.
This girl…

534
00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:51.541
Komang.

535
00:31:51.625 --> 00:31:53.375
Did you hear?

536
00:31:53.458 --> 00:31:56.250
Arya secured a job in Kalimantan.

537
00:31:57.375 --> 00:31:59.083
He's bound for success,

538
00:31:59.166 --> 00:32:01.875
and he's from Bali, just like us.

539
00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:07.333
I'm gonna go help Kadek.

540
00:32:08.375 --> 00:32:09.208
Komang.

541
00:32:10.541 --> 00:32:12.000
I'm talking to you right now.

542
00:32:12.875 --> 00:32:13.625
Sit!

543
00:32:17.958 --> 00:32:21.416
No mother wants her child to suffer.

544
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.375
They only wish them happiness.

545
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.791
If your own mother,
who gave you life, thinks this way,

546
00:32:28.875 --> 00:32:31.000
imagine how your Creator feels about you.

547
00:32:31.083 --> 00:32:31.916
[thuds]

548
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:33.750
Gosh.

549
00:32:35.708 --> 00:32:36.833
[sighs]

550
00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:42.958
Thanks.

551
00:32:45.541 --> 00:32:47.625
Do I look like a Made or a Nyoman?

552
00:32:48.416 --> 00:32:49.250
You do.

553
00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:51.041
You look like an "I Nyoman Hanuman."

554
00:32:51.833 --> 00:32:52.791
Huh?

555
00:32:56.958 --> 00:32:58.458
[monkey noises]

556
00:32:58.541 --> 00:33:00.333
Lovely weather today.

557
00:33:01.666 --> 00:33:03.416
You're taking the audition
to go to Jakarta?

558
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.916
Yeah.

559
00:33:09.416 --> 00:33:12.083
Is this because of what
my mom said earlier?

560
00:33:12.166 --> 00:33:13.458
What did she say?

561
00:33:13.541 --> 00:33:14.583
I'm serious.

562
00:33:14.666 --> 00:33:17.125
Me too. I didn't hear anything.

563
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.208
Oh, I know.

564
00:33:19.291 --> 00:33:21.750
I bet she's proud that I look like Ade.

565
00:33:27.333 --> 00:33:28.958
By the way, what is this for?

566
00:33:30.416 --> 00:33:31.916
This is an offering.

567
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:34.833
To show our gratitude.

568
00:33:38.125 --> 00:33:39.833
How long will you stay in Jakarta?

569
00:33:41.041 --> 00:33:43.333
[sighs] I can't say for sure.

570
00:33:44.208 --> 00:33:47.333
If I make it big, amen.

571
00:33:48.833 --> 00:33:50.416
I might stay there for good.

572
00:33:51.958 --> 00:33:56.625
I hope you succeed and make it to Jakarta.

573
00:33:56.708 --> 00:33:57.750
[exclaims]

574
00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:03.958
That's exactly what I need,
prayers from all directions!

575
00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:07.458
If both our Gods bless me,

576
00:34:07.541 --> 00:34:09.458
there's no way I'll fail.

577
00:34:09.541 --> 00:34:10.791

[phone dings]

580
00:34:30.416 --> 00:34:31.333
Komang.

581
00:34:32.458 --> 00:34:35.250
Your mom's asking for you.
She needs your help.

582
00:34:35.333 --> 00:34:37.875
Okay. I'll go over there.

583
00:34:37.958 --> 00:34:39.041
What about me?

584
00:34:39.625 --> 00:34:40.958
Need my help?

585
00:34:41.041 --> 00:34:43.708
No need, I don't want to trouble you.

586
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:44.875
-All good.
-Come on.

587
00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:50.750
Take it easy.

588
00:34:51.416 --> 00:34:52.333
Relax.

589
00:34:53.583 --> 00:34:55.791
Just completely ignore my presence, huh?

590
00:34:55.875 --> 00:34:59.083

Five scrubs in! If I keep at it,
a genie will come out!

594
00:35:15.916 --> 00:35:17.666
[Ode's dad] Just be patient.

595
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.166
You're always so fussy
when I ask for help.

596
00:35:20.958 --> 00:35:22.083
[Ode] Peace be upon you!

597
00:35:22.166 --> 00:35:25.291
And upon you peace
and God's mercy and blessings.

00:35:27.958 --> 00:35:29.833
[Ode's dad] My beloved son is here.

[Ode groans]

601
00:35:31.166 --> 00:35:32.666
What? You need anything?

602
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.666
You finish that.

603
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.500
-Here you go.
-Go.

604
00:35:35.583 --> 00:35:36.791
I brought some food for dinner.

605
00:35:36.875 --> 00:35:38.375
Oh. I'll take it upstairs.

606
00:35:38.458 --> 00:35:39.291
Okay.

[indistinct chattering]

-Hey!
-What, Dad?

613
00:36:05.458 --> 00:36:07.333
Why do you keep on staring at her?

614
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.416
She's not going to disappear.

615
00:36:13.375 --> 00:36:14.583
Are you serious about her?

616
00:36:15.333 --> 00:36:17.083
Of course.

617
00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:18.041
[protesting groan]

618
00:36:18.125 --> 00:36:19.791
I wouldn't bring her here if I wasn't.

619
00:36:19.875 --> 00:36:21.875
You'll face a heavy burden.

620
00:36:21.958 --> 00:36:24.041
I know that, Dad.

621
00:36:24.583 --> 00:36:26.291
Hey, Raim.

622
00:36:29.375 --> 00:36:30.625
Is she serious about you?

623
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.625
I think so.

[skeptical huff]

625
00:36:37.416 --> 00:36:40.583
I'm your son, don't treat me like that.

626
00:36:41.291 --> 00:36:42.791
Listen to me.

627
00:36:45.208 --> 00:36:46.291
It's in human nature

628
00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:51.000
to love and care for one another,

629
00:36:51.875 --> 00:36:53.458
regardless of religion.

630
00:36:55.291 --> 00:36:57.375
But as a leader,

631
00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:02.250
your follower should be of the same faith.

[somber music playing]

00:37:10.291 --> 00:37:13.375
Anyway, don't stress about it.

Leave it to fate.

635

If you're meant to be with her,

636
00:37:24.583 --> 00:37:25.958
there will be a way.

[in Arabic] I take refuge in Allah
from the cursed devil.

In the name of God, the Most Gracious,
the Most Merciful.

O Allah, bless us
in what You have provided for us,

and protect us from

that he's leaving home?

Is that why we have a feast?

665

I'm not excited, I'm sad.

666

1002
00:56:15.458 --> 00:56:17.166
Can you hear it?

1003
00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:18.916
What?

1004
00:56:21.083 --> 00:56:22.583
My way of saying I miss you.

1005

ENGLISH TUTORING CENTER

1006
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:30.333
[Ode] Hang in there.

1007
00:56:31.708 --> 00:56:33.375
This is part of our journey.

1008
00:56:36.125 --> 00:56:37.541
I'll get even busier,

1009
00:56:38.291 --> 00:56:39.166
but I have to succeed.

1010
00:56:40.333 --> 00:56:41.666
[Komang] I understand.

1011
00:56:42.208 --> 00:56:44.583
I'll always support you from here.

1012
00:56:50.791 --> 00:56:51.625
Raim!

1013
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:55.625
Raim!

1014
00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.875
Meet Natasha, a music producer.

1015
00:56:58.958 --> 00:57:00.166
Oh, hi.

1016
00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:01.875
-Natasha.
-Raim.

1017
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:11.458
FEELING GRATEFUL AND EXCITED
TO START A NEW JOURNEY

1018
00:57:12.666 --> 00:57:14.666
Stay calm. Keep your spirits up.

1019
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:15.541
Bro.

1020
00:57:15.625 --> 00:57:17.458
-How are you?
-I'm good.

1021
00:57:17.541 --> 00:57:18.666
-See you.
-Bye.

1022
00:57:21.166 --> 00:57:22.500
[gasps] Man.

1023
00:57:22.958 --> 00:57:24.125
Was that Afgan?

1024
00:57:24.208 --> 00:57:25.541
-Yeah.
-The real Afgan?

1025
00:57:25.625 --> 00:57:27.750
-The singer, yeah. Yeah.
-He's your friend?

1026
00:57:27.833 --> 00:57:29.375
Don't lie. He's your friend?

1027
00:57:29.458 --> 00:57:31.583
-Yes, the Afgan.
-That's crazy.

1028
00:57:31.666 --> 00:57:32.833
[Ola] Okay, so…

1029
00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:37.166
Does anyone know
the English word for "bunga"?

1030
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:39.041
[kids in English] Flower!

1031
00:57:39.125 --> 00:57:40.250
Good.

1032
00:57:40.333 --> 00:57:41.583
Rini, what flower do you like?

1033
00:57:41.666 --> 00:57:43.083
ARE YOU THAT BUSY?
CALL ME WHEN YOU CAN.

1034
00:57:43.166 --> 00:57:44.041
[Rini] Sunflower.

1035
00:57:44.125 --> 00:57:46.041
[Ola] What's that in English?

1036
00:57:46.125 --> 00:57:47.208
[Rini in English] Sunflower.

1037
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:49.875
-I like sunflowers too.
-Good job.

1038
00:57:49.958 --> 00:57:52.208
Does anyone know
the English word for "hujan"?

1039
00:57:52.291 --> 00:57:53.666
-Me!
-Rain!

1040
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:56.916
-Good.
-Usually, when it rains,

1041
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.541
I like to get soaked in the rain.

1042
00:57:59.625 --> 00:58:01.375
-[Ola] Really?
-When I go home.

1043
00:58:01.458 --> 00:58:03.000
-[Ola] Can you do that?
-Yeah.

1044
00:58:03.083 --> 00:58:05.541
-[Ola] Don't you get in trouble?
-But I must change first.

1045
00:58:05.625 --> 00:58:07.208
[Ola] Oh.

1046
00:58:19.875 --> 00:58:20.708
Let's go.

1047
00:58:26.875 --> 00:58:28.958
Are you happy being a Muslim?

1048
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.583
I feel nothing but gratitude so far.

1049
00:58:37.583 --> 00:58:39.458
Why are you asking that?

1050
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:43.750
No reason. Just curious.

1051
00:58:47.875 --> 00:58:50.000
My dad said

1052
00:58:50.083 --> 00:58:53.333
that faith requires conviction.

1053
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.958
If you hesitate,
then it's no longer belief,

1054
00:58:57.041 --> 00:58:58.291
but doubt.

1055
00:59:03.416 --> 00:59:04.833
How are you and Raim?

1056
00:59:07.541 --> 00:59:10.208
We're fine.

1057
00:59:11.791 --> 00:59:12.791
I figured.

1058
00:59:16.708 --> 00:59:18.458
I wish someone would fight over me too.

1059
00:59:18.541 --> 00:59:19.666
Like…

1060
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:21.416
[whines playfully]

1061
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.625
"Stop! Don't fight over me."

1062
00:59:24.708 --> 00:59:26.791
"I can choose for myself!"

1063
00:59:26.875 --> 00:59:29.041
-"Don't touch me! No!"
-[woman] Ola!

1064
00:59:29.541 --> 00:59:31.875
Get my prayer gown! I want to pray.

1065
00:59:31.958 --> 00:59:33.000
Hang on.

1066
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Ade.

1067
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:37.958
Let's go.

1068
00:59:39.833 --> 00:59:41.333
[Ode] What do I do now?

1069
00:59:41.416 --> 00:59:43.916
You're already on the right track, Raim.

1070
00:59:44.833 --> 00:59:47.708
SUCU is just a stepping stone.

1071
00:59:47.791 --> 00:59:49.791
[in English] It's like a… jump stone.

1072
00:59:49.875 --> 00:59:50.958
[chuckles]

1073
00:59:51.041 --> 00:59:52.166
Right?

1074
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:53.583
Huh? What do you mean?

1075
00:59:53.666 --> 00:59:54.916
See? He agrees.

1076
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.250
[chuckles]

1077
00:59:56.333 --> 00:59:59.375
Everyone should first be familiar
with Raim Laode.

1078
01:00:00.791 --> 01:00:02.250
So I shouldn't go home yet?

1079
01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:05.541
Yeah. You can't just go back and forth
between Sulawesi and Jakarta.

1080
01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:08.416
Three days in Jakarta
is barely more than a seminar trip.

1081
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.125
A week?

1082
01:00:10.208 --> 01:00:11.083
Study tour!

1083
01:00:11.791 --> 01:00:12.708
A month?

1084
01:00:12.791 --> 01:00:14.583
Enough questions! Sit.

1085
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:16.125
Hey.

1086
01:00:17.916 --> 01:00:19.750
[Maman] There she is. Nat!

1087
01:00:21.625 --> 01:00:25.333
-How are you? Sorry you had to wait.
-I'm doing great, Nat.

1088
01:00:25.416 --> 01:00:26.458
How are you?

1089
01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:28.791
I'm good, thanks. Hello. Hi.

1090
01:00:30.083 --> 01:00:31.083
[stammers]

1091
01:00:31.166 --> 01:00:32.666
[chuckling] How are you?

1092
01:00:34.708 --> 01:00:36.333
-[stammers] I'm good.
-Okay.

1093
01:00:36.416 --> 01:00:39.083
-Sit down. So I let her know that…
-Okay.

1094
01:00:39.166 --> 01:00:41.458
…you play guitar and write songs.

1095
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.916
She used to manage Ebiet G. Ade.

1096
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.166
Now he's become Ebiet G. A plus.

1097
01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.541
[cackling]

1098
01:00:46.625 --> 01:00:48.041
That's too much.

1099
01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:52.041
Let her check out your songs.

1100
01:00:52.708 --> 01:00:53.833
It's not finished, though.

1101
01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.708
As long as there's some sound in it.

1102
01:00:56.875 --> 01:00:57.875
Okay.

1103
01:00:58.916 --> 01:01:00.000
Do you mind wearing this?

1104
01:01:00.083 --> 01:01:01.083
I don't mind.

1105
01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:03.208
-Here.
-Okay, thanks.

1106
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:08.333
[faint music playing over phone]

1107
01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:19.250
It's good.

1108
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.500
Really good.

1109
01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:26.375
Nice demo.

1110
01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:27.666
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1111
01:01:28.666 --> 01:01:29.958
When can we start recording?

1112
01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:33.000
See? [exclaims]

1113
01:01:33.083 --> 01:01:34.166
That was quick.

1114
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.750
Um… I'm ready anytime.

1115
01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.875
[in English] Okay, good.

1116
01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:41.291
[Maman in English] Yes! Okay.

1117
01:01:41.375 --> 01:01:42.875
-Let's order something.
-All right.

1118
01:01:42.958 --> 01:01:44.291
[Maman] Excuse me!

1119
01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:46.125
Uh…

1120
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:48.833
Um…

1121
01:01:48.916 --> 01:01:49.833
Here.

1122
01:01:49.916 --> 01:01:55.375
I've informed Maman that we usually
take care of distribution.

1123
01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:58.041
[in English]
But we're open for discussion.

1124
01:01:58.125 --> 01:01:59.041
Got it.

1125
01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:02.833
By the way, you live in Jakarta, right?

1126
01:02:03.583 --> 01:02:07.083
Sometimes, I travel between
Jakarta and Baubau.

1127
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:10.000
And Baubau is in…?

1128
01:02:10.083 --> 01:02:11.000
Sulawesi.

1129
01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:14.458
That's tough.

1130
01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:18.333
[Komang] Did your producer
get to hear the song?

1131
01:02:19.458 --> 01:02:21.666
[Ode] Yeah. She likes it.

1132
01:02:23.916 --> 01:02:25.833
I must finish this song soon.

1133
01:02:26.666 --> 01:02:28.250
So I can't go home yet.

1134
01:02:28.333 --> 01:02:29.333
MAY THIS PROJECT BRING BLESSINGS.

1135

Mm…

1136
01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.416
It's okay.

1137
01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:37.666
This is your moment.

1138
01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.500
Is your producer a guy?

1139
01:02:46.583 --> 01:02:47.791
A girl.

1140
01:02:49.541 --> 01:02:50.625
How about you?

1141
01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:53.250
Haven't you been close with Arya lately?

1142
01:02:54.291 --> 01:02:55.500
I'm not.

1143
01:02:56.625 --> 01:02:59.541
But you're with Arya
more than you're with me, right?

1144
01:03:00.291 --> 01:03:02.083
You're not any better.

1145
01:03:02.166 --> 01:03:05.166
You're always with your producer.

We are dating,

but that doesn't mean you're tied down.

If you find someone better,

I won't stop you.

What do you mean?

1154
01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:36.541
That doesn't sound like a relationship.

1155
01:03:37.791 --> 01:03:39.375
Do you want to break up?

1156
01:03:41.458 --> 01:03:42.875
Maybe that's for the best.

[Ibu] Komang.

Why have you been ordering incense online?

1164
01:04:18.916 --> 01:04:20.666
[Komang] It's simpler that way.

Aren't you going to shower?
I thought Raim was coming.

1166
01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:27.291
He's not.

1167
01:04:28.208 --> 01:04:29.916
When is he coming?

1168
01:04:32.875 --> 01:04:34.916
Ode has things to do in Jakarta.

1169
01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:39.208
Oh, Komang.

1170
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.708
Be more realistic, won't you?

1171
01:04:43.375 --> 01:04:46.083
Look at what's in front of you

1172
01:04:46.166 --> 01:04:48.583
instead of chasing something far away.

1173
01:04:49.833 --> 01:04:51.625
When Arya is here,

1174
01:04:51.708 --> 01:04:55.625
he stops by every day to help us out.

1175
01:04:56.416 --> 01:04:57.666
He's kind, Komang.

1176
01:04:58.791 --> 01:04:59.958
Yes, Mom.

1177
01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.916
Why not see where it goes?

1178
01:05:03.875 --> 01:05:05.500
[sighs]

1179
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:09.125
Kadek moved with her husband.

1180
01:05:10.208 --> 01:05:12.250
If I'm with Arya,

1181
01:05:12.333 --> 01:05:14.750
he'll take me to Kalimantan.

1182
01:05:15.625 --> 01:05:19.166
You'll be all alone here,
and even lonelier.

1183
01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:24.458
If you're with Raim,
he will take you to Jakarta too.

1184
01:05:24.541 --> 01:05:27.541
Either way, I'll be alone.

1185
01:05:29.041 --> 01:05:33.416
At least if you're with Arya,
I'll feel more at ease.

1186
01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:35.833
Okay?

[sighs]

1188
01:05:48.083 --> 01:05:50.708
I guess love by itself isn't enough.

Do you know this saying?

1190
01:05:59.875 --> 01:06:03.666
A woman is always faced with two choices.

1191
01:06:04.791 --> 01:06:07.416
Accepting the man who proposes to them,

1192
01:06:08.166 --> 01:06:12.583
or waiting for the man they love to do so.

1193
01:06:14.166 --> 01:06:16.708
But I get to choose my soulmate, right?

1194
01:06:17.875 --> 01:06:19.208
I think

1195
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.208
that's up to fate to decide.

1196
01:06:29.416 --> 01:06:30.625
Rini.

1197
01:06:34.083 --> 01:06:35.333
Are you done playing?

1198
01:06:35.416 --> 01:06:36.666
Yes, Auntie.

1199
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:39.166
You can take off your hijab if it's hot.

1200
01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:43.708
No, my mom says
I look prettier with a hijab.

1201
01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:45.916
You are pretty, Rini.

1202
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.708
-Let's go home, then.
-[Rini] Yeah.

1203
01:06:47.791 --> 01:06:48.916
Good girl.

1204
01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:51.291
Say what to Auntie?

1205
01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:54.333
-Bye, Auntie Komang.
-Bye, Rini, Ola.

1206
01:07:00.541 --> 01:07:01.625
Auntie.

1207

Peace be upon you.

1208
01:07:04.583 --> 01:07:07.416
And upon you peace.

1209
01:07:07.958 --> 01:07:09.666
What are you doing here?

1210
01:07:10.166 --> 01:07:17.333
I'm here to deliver Ode's donation to
the temple, mosque, and church.

1211
01:07:18.625 --> 01:07:21.041
My husband is not doing too well.

1217
01:07:55.291 --> 01:07:57.291
I'm at a loss.

1218
01:08:00.166 --> 01:08:01.791
Whenever Dad asks

1219
01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:04.916
about Ode,

1220
01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:09.125
how Ode is doing,

1221
01:08:12.125 --> 01:08:13.916
I don't know how to answer.

1222
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.208
I think

1223
01:08:19.833 --> 01:08:22.083
he really misses Ode.

1224
01:08:24.916 --> 01:08:26.750
Do you still keep in touch often?

1225
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:33.583
If you do,

1226
01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:37.375
tell him to come home.

1227
01:08:38.416 --> 01:08:40.125
His father misses him.

1228
01:08:40.208 --> 01:08:42.750
HOPEFULLY, THIS COLLABORATION
WILL BE A SWEET START

1229
01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:45.333
[Arya] I've talked to your mom.

1230
01:08:45.875 --> 01:08:48.083
I want us to take the next step.
I want to marry you.

1231
01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:50.041
What are you even saying?

1232
01:08:50.958 --> 01:08:52.500
I know this can't come
as a surprise to you.

1233

You've always known how I feel.

I know you and Raim are a thing,

1235
01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:58.958
but I can't bear to see you like this.

1236
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.708
You're precious, Ade.
You deserve certainty.

1237

And you have me here. A certainty.

Ade.

1239

You're wasting your time.

Sorry.

1334

Let me say hi to your mom.

1335
01:17:36.916 --> 01:17:39.333
I feel bad for keeping you out this late.

1336
01:17:39.416 --> 01:17:42.958
It's fine. She's probably asleep anyway.

1337
01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:44.375
You should go home.

1338
01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:49.666
At least let me walk you home.

1339

Okay.

You didn't answer my calls!

My mom accepted Arya's proposal.

1353

I've been meaning to tell you,

1354
01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:59.541
but I couldn't find the right moment.

1355

The right moment?

1356
01:19:02.875 --> 01:19:05.125
There is no right moment for this.

1357

When did he propose?

1358
01:19:11.458 --> 01:19:13.375
A week or two ago.

1359
01:19:15.875 --> 01:19:17.291
Why do you ask?

1360

We broke up.

1361

But if you've said yes to Arya,
it's all over!

1362

My mom accepted Arya's proposal, not me!

I haven't given him my answer.

1364

He said he's serious,
but I haven't accepted it.

1365
01:19:36.791 --> 01:19:39.916
-So why didn't you turn him down?
-Why should I?

1366
01:19:41.666 --> 01:19:44.500
You're never there for me, Ode!

You're always busy with your own thing!

1368

You're making me lose my faith in you.

1369
01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:54.541
Now I have a chance to make my mom happy.

It's my dream!

That's my dream!

But your mother…

1373
01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:03.833
Your mother won't approve of me
if I'm not settled.

1374
01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.458
But I can do it now.

1375
01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:09.291
I can make you happy.

1376

I don't need empty words.

1377

If you mean it,
show me so that I can believe!

1378

Believe that we belong together!

1379

But you know this is hard right now, Ade!

1380

Because I must get

I believe we'll be like that one day.

1656
01:42:57.083 --> 01:42:58.166
God willing.

1657
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.291
[both exclaiming, laughing]

1658
01:43:07.375 --> 01:43:09.041
Ouch!

1659
01:43:11.083 --> 01:43:12.500
What dance is that?

1660
01:43:12.583 --> 01:43:13.458
Hey!

1661
01:43:13.541 --> 01:43:15.458
Kecak dance! From Bali!

1662

["Komang" continues playing]

1663
01:43:48.166 --> 01:43:52.583
Komang, not yet. That's for your husband.

1664
01:43:52.666 --> 01:43:57.083
Why not? I'm just giving it a taste.

1665
01:43:57.166 --> 01:43:59.708
You should wait, dear. Be patient.

1666
01:43:59.791 --> 01:44:00.916
Is everything here?

1667
01:44:01.708 --> 01:44:04.916
Who's really your child, me or Raim?

1668
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.208
It feels like you love Raim more.

1669
01:44:07.916 --> 01:44:10.583
You're jealous of your own husband?

1670
01:44:10.666 --> 01:44:11.541
Yeah.

1671
01:44:14.041 --> 01:44:14.875
Is this everything?

1672
01:44:14.958 --> 01:44:16.291
Good afternoon.

1673
01:44:16.375 --> 01:44:18.375
Good afternoon.

1674
01:44:18.458 --> 01:44:20.875
[exclaims] Wow. That's a lot!

1675
01:44:20.958 --> 01:44:21.833
Who cooked all this?

1676
01:44:23.416 --> 01:44:26.708
Oh, it turns out to be my love.

1677
01:44:26.791 --> 01:44:28.458
I'm off to Friday prayer.

1678
01:44:28.875 --> 01:44:30.416
What about lunch?

1679
01:44:31.791 --> 01:44:34.625
I'd love to,
but I'll eat after I come back.

1680
01:44:34.708 --> 01:44:36.416
If I eat now, whew,

1681
01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.458
I'd be so full,
I'd feel drowsy during prayer.

1682
01:44:39.208 --> 01:44:40.250
Okay then.

1683
01:44:40.333 --> 01:44:44.041
Bring this and hand it out to the people.

1684
01:44:44.125 --> 01:44:45.125
Okay, Mom.

1685
01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.375
I'm sure they appreciate
having this every Friday.

1686
01:44:49.458 --> 01:44:50.958
It's not a big deal.

1687
01:44:51.041 --> 01:44:51.958
Thank you, Mom.

1688
01:44:52.041 --> 01:44:53.208
You're welcome.

1689
01:44:54.708 --> 01:44:55.916
No goodbye kiss?

1690
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.125
[chuckling]

1691
01:44:57.208 --> 01:44:58.000
Okay.

1692

-Peace upon you.

["Lesung Pipi" by Raim Laode playing]

1694

Forgive me, body and soul.
