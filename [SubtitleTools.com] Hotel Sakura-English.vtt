WEBVTT

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:55.791
Across the spring sky

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.541
As far as the eye can see

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:13.500
Is it mist or clouds?

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.750
Fragrant in the air

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.375
Come now

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.041
Come now

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Mom, I'm scared.

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:45.625
Don't be.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.708
Dad is no longer with us, Mom.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.333
No, he'll come and kill that bad man.

00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:36.958
Hiroshima and Nagasaki

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:38.875
were reduced to ashes.

00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:43.041
But it doesn't mean Japan has lost.

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:47.500
Everyone who bows to the Allies
is a traitor.

00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:49.291
And traitors have to face death.

00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:56.291
And death is coming for all of you.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.208
Aya.

00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:17.125
Aya.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:24.333
This is the talisman
to protect our family.

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:29.583
Your grandma gave it to me.

00:03:32.541 --> 00:03:35.416
And now I'm giving it to you.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.083
If you miss me,

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.000
ring the bell.

00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:53.958
Don't ever forget…

00:03:55.875 --> 00:04:01.416
that I always love you.

00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:11.583
Mom, don't say things like that.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:24.333
Your husband has ordered his men
to bow down to the enemies.

00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.916
All of you are traitors!

00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.833
You can kill me,

00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:37.041
but don't touch my daughter!

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:38.500
You're all going to die!

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:55.375
Aya, everything will be okay.

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:04.833
This talisman

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:09.500
has no power to save you now.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.250
You don't need to keep it.

00:06:09.458 --> 00:06:13.208
There is no religion
that does not have writing

00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:15.416
regarding supernatural creatures.

00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:21.291
Whatever the religion, belief, or rite is…

00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:24.625
They all share the same perception

00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:26.833
of the existence of supernatural beings.

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:28.708
Let's check this out.

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:32.958
The first one is from Christianity.

00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:35.208
Then Islam.

00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:38.916
Then Buddhism and Hinduism.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
As you can see,
all of them have the belief.

00:06:43.583 --> 00:06:45.291
Atheists also have the same belief.

00:06:45.916 --> 00:06:50.125
Most of them believe in the existence
of supernatural creatures.

00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:52.416
Correct. Japan, for example.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.708
Most Japanese
are not too fond of religion.

00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.791
But they have a strong belief

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.625
in the existence
of supernatural creatures.

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:04.458
So what do you think
about their existence?

00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:08.875
I'm talking about this phenomenon
from an academic point of view,

00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.583
not to prove their existence.

00:07:11.666 --> 00:07:13.166
They do exist.

00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:21.166
So Aldo here believes in the existence
of supernatural creatures.

00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:25.791
Class dismissed. Thank you.

00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:29.416
Please finish the assignment
and see you tomorrow. Good afternoon.

00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:39.750
Nid, I'll stop by the cafe
after visiting my dad.

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:43.000
I'll do some work there.

00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:49.416
Don't let it get in your head.

00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:52.708
People nowadays

00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:58.125
don't want to be seen as old-fashioned
for believing in "their" existence.

00:08:40.583 --> 00:08:42.500
Sir, Ms. Sarah is here.

00:08:44.083 --> 00:08:46.750
Sarah, have you been here long?

00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:48.333
I just got here.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.291
Sarah. Enough is enough.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.416
It's been too long.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.125
Stop blaming yourself.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.625
What are you working on this time?

00:09:56.625 --> 00:09:58.125
Subtitles for a romance movie.

00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:01.250
Romance is good for a change.
You've had too many horror movies.

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:03.000
It's not good for your health.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.916
Look over there.

00:10:10.583 --> 00:10:12.458
That guy keeps looking at you.

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:19.166
Maybe he has a crush on you.

00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:28.208
Okay, I'll get back to work.
Selfi will scold me.

00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:30.875
Don't forget that
we're going home together.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.750
Are you following me?

00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:39.416
I know for sure
that we believe in the same thing.

00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:42.041
Freak.

00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958
Have you ever heard of Yomi-no-kuni?

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:51.958
The belief of the Japanese.

00:11:56.875 --> 00:11:59.375
Do you mean the door of Yomi-no-kuni?

00:11:59.458 --> 00:12:01.541
The door to the land of the dead?

00:12:02.666 --> 00:12:04.875
I knew that you know about it.

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:09.458
I found a place
where that kind of thing is real.

00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958
Someone told me about it and I went there.

00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:29.041
I met my sister there.

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.791
We talked.

00:12:35.083 --> 00:12:36.958
I know you lost someone before.

00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:46.625
What are you talking about?

00:12:46.708 --> 00:12:50.416
I can see it in your eyes.

00:13:18.833 --> 00:13:19.750
What happened?

00:13:21.666 --> 00:13:23.291
Something has gotten into you?

00:13:23.916 --> 00:13:25.208
No, it's nothing.

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:28.791
Let's just go home
before something actually gets into you.

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:30.708
Okay.

00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:56.375
The door to Yomi-no-kuni?

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:40.125
You guys have to know.
I'm going to Paris for my next vacation.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.625
-Paris? That's so cool.
-Yeah.

00:14:43.708 --> 00:14:47.041
My dad just bought me the newest phone.

00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:51.250
-That's so cool.
-It's cool, right?

00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:52.708
Hold on.

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.125
You have to hear this too.

00:14:54.208 --> 00:14:58.416
My parents said if I get a good grade,
they will buy me

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.000
a watch…

00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:16.041
-What's next?
-Let's just hang out.

00:15:22.166 --> 00:15:25.750
Sarah, let's go to the mall.

00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:28.000
Come on.

00:15:28.083 --> 00:15:32.041
-Don't think too much.
-Let's just have fun together.

00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:49.666
What are we going to do today?

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.750
Let's go to karaoke.

00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:53.750
-What about beauty care?
-That's a good idea too.

00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:56.041
We have to go to the beauty parlor.
It's been so long.

00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:57.750
Look at your hair.

00:15:57.833 --> 00:16:00.208
It used to be curly.

00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:03.500
I don't have time to do my hair.
We just finished the exam.

00:16:03.583 --> 00:16:06.833
-I was so stressed out.
-But the thing is…

00:16:06.916 --> 00:16:08.500
I was so busy.

00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:13.416
Let's do everything today and have fun.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.458
Let's have fun together.

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:25.541
-Do you remember the guy from yesterday?
-I do.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.416
What did he do?

00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:29.666
He's my classmate.

00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:34.666
He told me he met his sister's spirit
in that place.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.458
Is it still about the same thing?

00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:47.166
We went to so many strange places
so you could meet your mom.

00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:49.500
But none of them proved right.

00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:54.125
We even went to a funeral in Toraja,
but nothing happened.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.208
The Babukung dance of the Dayak people?

00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.583
That place was full of mosquitoes.

00:17:59.916 --> 00:18:01.000
Salak Mountain?

00:18:01.791 --> 00:18:04.083
You were an inch away from dying
because of hypothermia.

00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:12.583
Who knows I might have a chance
to see my mom?

00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:29.041
Sar.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.500
Perhaps

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
your mom is happy in heaven.

00:18:37.791 --> 00:18:39.083
She wants you to let her go.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.416
Enough is enough.

00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:49.500
Let her rest in peace.

00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:25.208
Okay, fine. I'll go with you.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.375
I'll go with you to that place,

00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:32.833
but this is the last time.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.833
There's no next time.

00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:22.583
You call that a hotel?

00:20:22.666 --> 00:20:24.250
Who wants to stay there?

00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:27.875
We do. We're going to stay there.

00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:35.833
We'd better hope
that this place has a karaoke bar.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.541
This could be the death of me.

00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:43.458
Did we find any karaoke bars
in Salak Mountain?

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.625
Excuse me.

00:21:10.458 --> 00:21:12.791
No karaoke bar this time.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.666
Look at this place.

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.875
Are you sure this is a hotel?

00:21:35.958 --> 00:21:37.166
It looks more like a graveyard.

00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:55.916
What's wrong?

00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:06.041
I think I saw a woman there.

00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:09.458
Where?

00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:15.500
Maybe she's a guest.

00:22:30.291 --> 00:22:31.291
Hello.

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:36.708
Where's everyone?

00:22:41.333 --> 00:22:44.541
Let's just sit there until someone's here.

00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:48.541
Good evening.

00:22:59.083 --> 00:23:00.500
No one was here.

00:23:01.208 --> 00:23:02.708
Where did you come from?

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.708
I'm Indarto.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.500
Welcome to Hotel Sakura.

00:23:17.333 --> 00:23:20.541
How long are you going to stay here?

00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:22.708
Three nights.

00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:25.333
I thought it was only a night.

00:23:26.708 --> 00:23:29.083
Three nights, for two.

00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:33.083
Can I see your ID?

00:23:33.166 --> 00:23:34.708
You can use mine.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.416
This is the charge for three nights.

00:23:42.875 --> 00:23:44.708
You don't have the key to room number 8.

00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:47.291
From 7, you jump to 9.

00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:49.125
Why is that?

00:23:50.166 --> 00:23:51.000
Sir.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.041
Sign here.

00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:05.791
Hi.

00:24:07.541 --> 00:24:09.875
We have two guests in the lobby.
Please help.

00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:13.000
It seems like you don't have many guests.

00:24:13.083 --> 00:24:16.041
You two are our only guests.

00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:19.625
But I saw a woman there.

00:24:24.041 --> 00:24:25.291
Good evening.

00:24:28.708 --> 00:24:30.791
Why does everyone appear out of nowhere?

00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:32.666
Fikar.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.583
Please take them to room 5.

00:24:38.875 --> 00:24:41.125
Let me. You're so slow.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.708
Come on.

00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:47.875
Sir.

00:24:50.375 --> 00:24:54.458
Is it true that we are the only guests
in this hotel?

00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:56.916
I saw someone here.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.125
Maybe it's just your imagination.

00:25:03.333 --> 00:25:04.166
Come on.

00:25:08.791 --> 00:25:12.708
I think it's just your imagination too.

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.166
Come in.

00:25:55.583 --> 00:25:57.041
It's quite big.

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:02.750
If you don't have a karaoke bar,
the cable TV must be available, right?

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.583
Here.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.250
Excuse me.

00:26:15.083 --> 00:26:17.041
If you are looking for spirits,

00:26:17.125 --> 00:26:19.583
they'd be the spirits you're looking for.

00:26:19.666 --> 00:26:20.958
Freak.

00:26:42.375 --> 00:26:45.875
Why do we have a broomstick here?

00:26:49.625 --> 00:26:51.958
I heard that in Javanese mythology,

00:26:53.333 --> 00:26:55.250
people use this…

00:26:56.458 --> 00:26:57.791
for repelling evil spirits.

00:27:02.708 --> 00:27:04.541
Evil spirits are scared of this, huh?

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.291
Does this drive them out?

00:27:08.166 --> 00:27:10.208
I didn't think about that.

00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:13.708
People really make ghost repellers?

00:27:15.291 --> 00:27:16.833
It's what they believe in.

00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:23.208
So it means…

00:27:24.708 --> 00:27:26.291
this hotel is haunted, right?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.291
They even gave us this weapon
to drive the ghost out.

00:27:32.375 --> 00:27:33.541
That's weird.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:39.333
Well, I know for sure
we can use it to clean the bed.

00:27:39.875 --> 00:27:41.291
We took it too far.

00:27:43.666 --> 00:27:46.000
"We"? It's just you.

00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:09.041
Sarah.

00:29:23.291 --> 00:29:24.416
What's wrong?

00:29:36.083 --> 00:29:37.750
Let's make a wish.

00:29:43.208 --> 00:29:44.458
I wish

00:29:45.375 --> 00:29:47.333
I could see my mom.

00:29:48.375 --> 00:29:49.250
Amen.

00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:53.583
I hope your wish comes true.

00:29:53.666 --> 00:29:55.875
Amen. Blow out the candles.

00:29:59.666 --> 00:30:00.583
Are you happy now?

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:04.333
One more thing.

00:30:04.416 --> 00:30:05.250
Wait here.

00:30:06.291 --> 00:30:07.750
What's that?

00:30:07.833 --> 00:30:09.500
Just close your eyes.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.375
Now open your eyes.

00:30:26.916 --> 00:30:28.875
What do you think? Do you like it?

00:30:37.791 --> 00:30:39.291
Happy birthday.

00:30:49.708 --> 00:30:53.083
Mom, I want to see you.

00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:58.000
I hope this is the place
where we can meet.

00:31:38.333 --> 00:31:40.041
Sarah.

00:31:43.166 --> 00:31:44.000
Mom?

00:31:56.791 --> 00:31:58.250
The fried rice is not bad, right?

00:32:06.208 --> 00:32:08.708
You're not wearing the bracelet.
You don't like it?

00:32:12.125 --> 00:32:13.583
I'm going to wear it later.

00:32:16.083 --> 00:32:17.500
Why the long face?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.541
Good morning, Ms. Sarah.

00:32:24.541 --> 00:32:25.708
Ms. Nida.

00:32:27.166 --> 00:32:28.791
How was your sleep last night?

00:32:29.583 --> 00:32:31.041
Did you sleep well?

00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:33.750
I slept well last night.

00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:38.375
But the room has that weird musty smell.

00:32:38.458 --> 00:32:39.416
It's like something is molding.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.291
Did you smell that?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.375
Sir.

00:32:45.916 --> 00:32:47.041
I heard that…

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.666
this hotel has a "guard"?

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.333
As I said before,

00:32:54.625 --> 00:32:56.458
you two are the only people staying here.

00:32:57.083 --> 00:32:59.458
But if you mean ghosts or evil spirits,

00:33:00.375 --> 00:33:02.333
for 40 years I've worked here,

00:33:02.916 --> 00:33:04.208
I've never seen anything.

00:33:07.291 --> 00:33:08.375
At all?

00:33:16.958 --> 00:33:18.083
Not at all.

00:33:20.833 --> 00:33:23.208
Please enjoy the breakfast.

00:33:25.833 --> 00:33:27.458
I don't believe him.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.583
It's just your nature, huh?

00:33:32.375 --> 00:33:34.375
You don't trust people,

00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:37.166
yet you believe in ghosts.

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:40.583
It seems like you're wrong this time.

00:33:41.375 --> 00:33:44.500
It's just an ordinary hotel.

00:33:45.375 --> 00:33:49.041
We slept well last night.

00:33:49.666 --> 00:33:51.958
But Aldo looked like
he was so sure about it.

00:33:54.666 --> 00:33:57.125
Why would he lie
about his sister's spirit?

00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:04.125
But it's only the first night.

00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:06.625
We still have another two nights.

00:34:07.416 --> 00:34:10.250
Two nights and we're just going
to stay here?

00:34:57.083 --> 00:34:58.000
Sir.

00:35:00.416 --> 00:35:02.208
Excuse me.

00:35:03.125 --> 00:35:04.291
Please excuse me.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:12.250
Did you see that?
He almost took that bracelet.

00:35:13.208 --> 00:35:14.750
I knew it.

00:35:14.833 --> 00:35:16.625
Let's just hope he didn't take anything.

00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:17.750
What do you want to know from me?

00:36:18.666 --> 00:36:20.708
Someone told me

00:36:22.166 --> 00:36:23.416
that this hotel

00:36:24.291 --> 00:36:25.500
is not an ordinary hotel.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.583
There's something here.

00:36:31.041 --> 00:36:34.291
So that's why you came here?

00:36:36.041 --> 00:36:36.916
Yes.

00:36:38.291 --> 00:36:40.833
Our hotel was just a peaceful hotel

00:36:40.916 --> 00:36:43.166
until people like you started coming here.

00:36:45.166 --> 00:36:46.666
So it's true?

00:36:48.916 --> 00:36:51.083
It's better for you
to go back to your room.

00:36:51.166 --> 00:36:53.125
I have to get back to work.

00:36:55.041 --> 00:36:56.791
My friend, Aldo, came here.

00:36:58.708 --> 00:36:59.750
Do you remember him?

00:37:03.083 --> 00:37:04.000
He's skinny

00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:06.000
with glasses,

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:08.916
and he's a little weird.

00:37:09.958 --> 00:37:13.625
Not a lot of people come here.
I remember all of them.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.708
Your friend didn't talk much.

00:37:16.791 --> 00:37:18.208
What did he do here?

00:37:19.583 --> 00:37:21.083
Which room did he stay in?

00:37:24.458 --> 00:37:25.375
Sir.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.333
He stayed…

00:37:29.708 --> 00:37:30.875
in room 8.

00:37:30.958 --> 00:37:33.125
But this hotel doesn't have
room number 8, right?

00:37:36.958 --> 00:37:38.208
Can I see the room?

00:37:41.916 --> 00:37:43.083
Please.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.958
It's really important for me.

00:37:48.291 --> 00:37:50.000
I won't tell anyone.

00:38:40.833 --> 00:38:42.708
Mom.

00:38:49.875 --> 00:38:51.166
Where have you been?

00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:54.583
Just follow me.

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:56.708
Come on.

00:39:05.541 --> 00:39:06.708
Come in.

00:39:32.583 --> 00:39:33.875
Who are these people?

00:39:35.333 --> 00:39:38.083
That's Captain Kaeda Yatsuichi

00:39:38.708 --> 00:39:42.500
with his wife, Setsuko,
and their daughter, Ayano.

00:39:42.583 --> 00:39:45.208
Long ago, this hotel

00:39:45.291 --> 00:39:48.583
was a home for Japanese military officers.

00:39:59.125 --> 00:40:01.041
So Aldo stayed in this room?

00:40:01.666 --> 00:40:03.000
Can I stay here too?

00:40:03.083 --> 00:40:04.041
No.

00:40:04.875 --> 00:40:06.208
You did the right thing, sir.

00:40:06.833 --> 00:40:08.791
This is not your friend's room.

00:40:08.875 --> 00:40:10.916
He slept somewhere else.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
But somehow, he managed
to get the duplicate key for this room.

00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:18.750
That's why I kicked him out.

00:40:21.416 --> 00:40:22.958
Why don't you guys
put this room up for rent?

00:40:24.333 --> 00:40:26.041
We can't.

00:40:26.125 --> 00:40:29.083
This room has a special history.

00:40:29.166 --> 00:40:34.500
When Hiroshima and Nagasaki
were bombarded by the Allies,

00:40:34.583 --> 00:40:39.041
Japan's emperor ordered
his soldiers to surrender.

00:40:39.958 --> 00:40:43.208
Some of the soldiers refused to bow down

00:40:43.291 --> 00:40:45.000
and even killed their own comrades,

00:40:45.625 --> 00:40:47.750
who surrendered to the Allies,
and were seen as traitors.

00:40:47.833 --> 00:40:50.500
Hiroshima and Nagasaki

00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:52.416
were reduced to ashes.

00:40:53.125 --> 00:40:56.583
But it doesn't mean Japan has lost.

00:40:56.666 --> 00:41:01.041
Everyone who bows to the Allies
is a traitor.

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:02.833
And traitors have to face death.

00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:07.458
Each one of Captain Kaeda's men,

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:12.541
even his wife and daughter,

00:41:12.625 --> 00:41:15.250
was brutally massacred.

00:41:20.375 --> 00:41:23.291
Setsuko and Ayano

00:41:24.375 --> 00:41:25.916
were butchered

00:41:30.416 --> 00:41:33.250
right in this room.

00:41:44.875 --> 00:41:47.833
What are you doing here?

00:41:48.958 --> 00:41:51.875
-Get out.
-Hurry. Everyone, get out.

00:42:10.666 --> 00:42:13.541
Are you really going to sleep
in that room?

00:42:16.083 --> 00:42:18.250
You said you don't believe in ghosts.

00:42:18.333 --> 00:42:19.833
But you don't need to go that far…

00:42:36.458 --> 00:42:39.041
Sar, did the lights go out?

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.416
It seems so.

00:43:01.958 --> 00:43:02.958
Nid.

00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:06.750
What now? Wait a second.

00:43:09.958 --> 00:43:11.041
This is not funny.

00:43:49.916 --> 00:43:51.333
Mom.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:05.750
Mom.

00:44:12.041 --> 00:44:14.250
Sar, it's me.

00:44:33.333 --> 00:44:34.416
Sorry.

00:44:35.666 --> 00:44:38.375
There was a power outage.

00:44:38.458 --> 00:44:40.958
It's an old building after all.

00:44:53.875 --> 00:44:55.500
Let's just go home.

00:44:56.541 --> 00:44:57.458
No.

00:45:06.083 --> 00:45:07.291
Aldo is right.

00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:12.500
This is the door to Yomi-no-kuni.

00:45:16.875 --> 00:45:18.791
The door to the land of the dead.

00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:30.875
So we can't be afraid.

00:45:33.541 --> 00:45:35.333
After all, it's what you want.

00:45:49.208 --> 00:45:51.166
Enjoy your meal, miss.

00:45:52.375 --> 00:45:53.458
Thanks.

00:45:54.958 --> 00:45:58.125
It's better not to wear that bracelet.

00:45:58.208 --> 00:46:00.666
It's for your own good, okay?

00:46:04.458 --> 00:46:05.583
What do you mean?

00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:08.916
-You have to hurry up and leave--
-Fikar.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:09.916
Wait.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.250
Leave this place.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.791
-Help me.
-Sure.

00:46:34.041 --> 00:46:35.083
What's wrong?

00:46:38.708 --> 00:46:39.916
Nothing.

00:46:43.125 --> 00:46:44.041
Sar.

00:46:48.541 --> 00:46:50.375
I want to sleep in room 8.

00:46:50.458 --> 00:46:53.166
But you heard it yourself.
Nobody can sleep in that room.

00:46:55.583 --> 00:46:57.958
But Aldo said he saw his sister
in that room.

00:46:59.083 --> 00:47:01.125
Who knows? I might see my mom there.

00:47:15.458 --> 00:47:17.083
Aya…

00:47:18.208 --> 00:47:21.041
Aya…

00:47:29.208 --> 00:47:31.458
Come on, before there's another blackout.

00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:33.916
I left the flashlight in the room.

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:05.833
Ayano…

00:49:07.416 --> 00:49:10.916
Ayano…

00:49:13.166 --> 00:49:17.041
Ayano…

00:49:43.916 --> 00:49:45.000
Sar.

00:49:46.166 --> 00:49:47.541
Sar.

00:49:50.083 --> 00:49:51.541
Let's go to the mall.

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:53.250
Sar.

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:55.208
Sar.

00:49:56.375 --> 00:49:58.958
Just come with us.

00:49:59.541 --> 00:50:00.500
Sar.

00:50:01.708 --> 00:50:03.833
Where are you going for vacation?

00:50:17.666 --> 00:50:18.583
Sar.

00:50:32.583 --> 00:50:33.416
Sar?

00:51:28.583 --> 00:51:29.666
Mom.

00:51:54.208 --> 00:51:55.333
Mom.

00:52:01.791 --> 00:52:03.041
Mom.

00:52:03.125 --> 00:52:04.125
Mom.

00:53:40.916 --> 00:53:42.750
Aya…

00:53:44.541 --> 00:53:46.875
Aya…

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:54.625
Nida!

00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:06.166
-Aya…
-Nida!

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.416
Aya…

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.416
Aya…

00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:17.500
-Nida!
-Aya…

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:32.166
Ayano…

00:54:32.916 --> 00:54:35.208
Ayano…

00:54:35.291 --> 00:54:37.041
Ayano…

00:54:41.333 --> 00:54:43.041
Nida!

00:54:50.208 --> 00:54:51.375
Mom.

00:55:04.208 --> 00:55:06.250
Ayano…

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:09.541
Ayano…

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:27.916
Are you all right?

00:55:32.833 --> 00:55:34.041
Let's go home.

00:56:43.625 --> 00:56:44.666
I want us…

00:56:47.875 --> 00:56:50.166
to forget whatever happened in that place.

00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:54.416
There's no need to remember it.

00:57:05.541 --> 00:57:06.416
Sarah.

00:57:07.708 --> 00:57:10.500
Let's just stop. This is the last one.

00:58:57.541 --> 00:58:58.583
Sir.

01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:09.166
Sar.

01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:11.291
Let's go to the mall.

01:02:11.833 --> 01:02:13.041
Let's go.

01:02:13.125 --> 01:02:14.708
Come on.

01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:17.500
-Let's go to the mall.
-Come on.

01:02:17.583 --> 01:02:19.750
Sarah, let's go to the mall.

01:02:20.458 --> 01:02:22.291
Come on.

01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:30.125
Sarah, where are you going?

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.541
Come on.

01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:36.916
Where are you going?

01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:39.000
Sarah…

01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:41.291
Come on.

01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:49.041
Going to that place was a huge mistake.

01:03:00.041 --> 01:03:01.750
Now I can't even tell…

01:03:06.166 --> 01:03:07.875
what's real

01:03:11.583 --> 01:03:13.083
and what's a dream.

01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:22.416
Everything is just so horrifying.

01:03:46.833 --> 01:03:48.208
Have you seen the doctor?

01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:59.208
I don't need a doctor.

01:04:03.916 --> 01:04:05.333
I don't need that kind of thing.

01:04:24.916 --> 01:04:28.416
I'll go to your place after work.

01:05:26.958 --> 01:05:30.833
Ayano…

01:05:55.375 --> 01:05:58.458
Ayano…

01:09:38.916 --> 01:09:42.083
Ayano…

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:14.125
Nida.

01:10:14.208 --> 01:10:17.000
Please let me know if you see Sarah.

01:10:17.625 --> 01:10:19.416
I've called her so many times,

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.291
but she didn't pick up.

01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:24.583
Sure, I will.

01:10:24.666 --> 01:10:27.958
I'll call you once I see her.

01:10:28.041 --> 01:10:29.333
Thank you.

01:11:00.041 --> 01:11:01.125
Sarah.

01:11:06.541 --> 01:11:08.125
Where have you been?

01:11:13.333 --> 01:11:14.875
"Where have you been"?

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:18.416
I'm here all the time.

01:11:19.916 --> 01:11:21.708
You were gone for three days.

01:11:24.458 --> 01:11:25.375
I…

01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:28.833
I came here the last time,
but you weren't here.

01:11:29.458 --> 01:11:31.333
I came again the next day,
but you weren't here either.

01:11:31.916 --> 01:11:33.666
And the day after.

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:35.833
I couldn't reach you.

01:11:37.666 --> 01:11:40.208
I went looking for you on campus
and called your dad.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.125
I didn't know
what happened to you for three days.

01:11:44.666 --> 01:11:47.750
I didn't go anywhere.

01:11:51.166 --> 01:11:53.125
I waited for you here

01:11:55.125 --> 01:11:56.500
for three days.

01:12:01.458 --> 01:12:02.833
Three days.

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:05.875
You were gone for three days.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.333
I don't know.

01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:17.208
I don't know.

01:12:18.583 --> 01:12:21.291
Which one of us has gone insane?

01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:33.000
I've had the same nightmares
for so many nights.

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:39.041
In my dream, I went back to that hotel.

01:12:41.041 --> 01:12:43.541
It's driving me crazy.

01:12:51.125 --> 01:12:55.375
I'm so scared.

01:15:08.208 --> 01:15:09.375
Mom.

01:15:16.291 --> 01:15:17.666
Mom.

01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:47.458
Mom.

01:15:49.708 --> 01:15:50.958
Mom.

01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:07.958
Mom.

01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:14.583
Sarah, wake up!

01:16:15.666 --> 01:16:17.791
Sarah.

01:16:17.875 --> 01:16:19.708
You're in your room with me.

01:16:20.708 --> 01:16:21.791
You had a dream.

01:16:29.125 --> 01:16:31.166
I have to go back to that hotel.

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:33.083
What are you going to do there?

01:16:34.916 --> 01:16:37.000
There's something I need to do.

01:16:40.333 --> 01:16:42.208
I have to go there.

01:16:42.833 --> 01:16:43.958
But Sarah…

01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:50.125
Come with me.

01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:55.625
The engine's overheated.
We'll have to wait.

01:17:56.375 --> 01:17:58.166
We'll go in 15 minutes.

01:18:03.875 --> 01:18:07.833
Why do people say…

01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:13.125
that the graveyard is the scariest place?

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:25.083
When it's actually the most peaceful…

01:18:27.375 --> 01:18:28.458
and most tranquil place.

01:18:30.416 --> 01:18:31.541
Listen.

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:35.458
With everything we've been dealing with,
let's not talk about graveyards.

01:18:35.541 --> 01:18:37.333
Let's talk about happy things instead.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:38.875
Okay?

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:48.583
I hope

01:18:49.416 --> 01:18:51.000
when all this is over,

01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:55.625
you can finally find your peace.

01:19:27.875 --> 01:19:28.916
Are you sure?

01:19:54.458 --> 01:19:55.958
What the hell?

01:20:03.416 --> 01:20:05.041
Mr. Indarto?

01:20:05.125 --> 01:20:06.291
Mr. Fikar?

01:20:10.541 --> 01:20:11.458
Nid.

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:13.291
I need to go.

01:20:14.291 --> 01:20:15.708
Please wait for Mr. Indarto here.

01:20:28.666 --> 01:20:30.000
Hello.

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:39.166
Sir?

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Sarah.

01:20:54.666 --> 01:20:57.208
Mom.

01:21:14.833 --> 01:21:15.666
Sar?

01:21:24.208 --> 01:21:25.041
Sarah.

01:21:41.791 --> 01:21:42.791
Mom.

01:21:52.083 --> 01:21:53.125
Sar.

01:22:10.041 --> 01:22:11.166
Sar.

01:22:34.041 --> 01:22:35.458
Mom.

01:22:49.875 --> 01:22:50.708
Hey.

01:22:55.041 --> 01:22:56.416
What are you doing here?

01:22:59.458 --> 01:23:00.791
Sorry.

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:03.500
Sarah and I waited in the lobby,

01:23:04.666 --> 01:23:05.875
but no one showed up.

01:23:05.958 --> 01:23:07.583
-Sarah?
-Yes.

01:23:07.666 --> 01:23:08.541
Sarah?

01:23:08.625 --> 01:23:10.000
I'm looking for her.

01:23:10.833 --> 01:23:15.291
But you and your friend
aren't supposed to be here. Get out.

01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:17.666
A WOMAN FOUND DEAD ON A HOTEL BALCONY

01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:19.458
A LITTLE GIRL FOUND DEAD
ON A HOTEL STAIRCASE

01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:20.375
Get out.

01:23:22.625 --> 01:23:23.458
Get out.

01:23:26.291 --> 01:23:28.041
A LITTLE GIRL FOUND DEAD
ON A HOTEL STAIRCASE

01:23:28.125 --> 01:23:29.000
Her.

01:23:29.083 --> 01:23:30.000
This girl…

01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:33.291
I've seen her in my room before.

01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:37.083
Go away.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.000
What exactly happened here?

01:23:49.375 --> 01:23:50.875
Are you hiding something?

01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:52.875
Is that so?

01:23:56.458 --> 01:23:57.291
Sir.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:23:59.833
Sir.

01:24:02.583 --> 01:24:03.458
Please answer.

01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:08.041
I gave you a warning.

01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:11.541
I told your friend
to stop wearing that bracelet

01:24:11.625 --> 01:24:12.625
and the other jewelry.

01:24:12.708 --> 01:24:16.375
It's better not to wear that bracelet.

01:24:16.458 --> 01:24:19.000
It's for your own good, okay?

01:24:19.833 --> 01:24:21.416
But she didn't listen.

01:24:23.166 --> 01:24:24.791
Please answer me, sir.

01:24:24.875 --> 01:24:27.291
It's true there are spirits in this hotel.

01:24:27.375 --> 01:24:28.625
But they're not evil.

01:24:29.833 --> 01:24:31.125
Except for…

01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:36.000
Setsuko.

01:24:36.083 --> 01:24:37.375
Setsuko?

01:24:40.416 --> 01:24:41.958
She's the ghost in room 8?

01:24:45.958 --> 01:24:46.916
That one?

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:54.083
Many women died in this hotel.

01:24:54.791 --> 01:25:00.666
Each one of them was wearing
the same ringing bracelet.

01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:04.083
That ringing is what calls Setsuko.

01:25:06.958 --> 01:25:07.958
Get up.

01:25:13.291 --> 01:25:14.125
Mom.

01:25:32.958 --> 01:25:35.083
Sarah…

01:25:35.625 --> 01:25:37.333
I'm sure she went back to that room.

01:25:37.416 --> 01:25:39.083
Please take me there.

01:25:39.625 --> 01:25:40.708
Please, sir.

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:57.541
Sir, I have to find her.

01:26:00.916 --> 01:26:02.375
What is happening here?

01:26:03.916 --> 01:26:04.958
Hey, you.

01:26:05.833 --> 01:26:08.958
Why are you here?

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:56.583
We presume she died a week ago.

01:27:16.833 --> 01:27:20.750
When they checked into
our hotel that night,

01:27:20.833 --> 01:27:22.458
everything seemed fine.

01:27:22.541 --> 01:27:24.125
There was nothing wrong.

01:27:25.333 --> 01:27:29.208
On the third night, I saw Ms. Nida
go out alone from the hotel.

01:27:37.375 --> 01:27:40.541
What happened to Sarah?

01:27:41.208 --> 01:27:42.500
I don't know.

01:27:44.666 --> 01:27:47.750
When we checked, their room was empty.

01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:54.750
How could it be?

01:27:55.791 --> 01:27:58.958
I'm sure they saw us.

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:02.666
Sarah was still alive
when she was with me.

01:28:04.083 --> 01:28:06.291
But the forensic results show

01:28:06.375 --> 01:28:08.125
she died nearly a week ago.

01:28:08.875 --> 01:28:12.041
There's no way you could've been with her
if she were already dead.

01:28:13.333 --> 01:28:16.166
Three days after Ms. Sarah went
on a trip with Ms. Nida,

01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:18.000
Ms. Nida went back to Ms. Sarah's place.

01:28:18.833 --> 01:28:21.666
But she was alone, without Ms. Sarah.

01:28:23.208 --> 01:28:26.791
Is Ms. Sarah back?

01:28:29.416 --> 01:28:31.125
I took her to her room.

01:28:31.875 --> 01:28:35.000
I saw her coming by herself.

01:28:36.333 --> 01:28:37.500
Then what happened?

01:28:38.333 --> 01:28:41.916
I didn't see her again after that day.

01:28:43.416 --> 01:28:47.500
But one night,
I peeked into Ms. Sarah's room.

01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:52.958
I saw her sleeping alone
in Ms. Sarah's room.

01:28:56.458 --> 01:28:59.458
I feel like there's something strange
about her behavior.

01:29:00.166 --> 01:29:01.875
I found out

01:29:02.458 --> 01:29:06.375
that Sarah was missing from her.

01:29:06.458 --> 01:29:10.416
She called me to ask
about Sarah's whereabouts.

01:29:11.625 --> 01:29:13.541
She was gone for three days.

01:29:14.166 --> 01:29:18.500
Nida said that Sarah was missing.

01:29:22.333 --> 01:29:26.958
She showed up from nowhere.

01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:34.208
She said she came with Ms. Sarah.

01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:38.250
But then, Ms. Sarah disappeared.

01:29:39.375 --> 01:29:44.333
Then she asked me to take her to room 8.

01:29:45.208 --> 01:29:48.875
Do you know why she asked you to do that?

01:29:48.958 --> 01:29:50.333
I don't know.

01:29:53.625 --> 01:29:56.750
No one agrees with your testimony.

01:29:57.791 --> 01:29:59.708
No one saw you

01:30:01.666 --> 01:30:04.541
with Sarah after you left that hotel.

01:30:05.708 --> 01:30:07.166
Those freaks…

01:30:10.541 --> 01:30:12.083
must be lying to you.

01:30:13.791 --> 01:30:17.541
Or perhaps it's just the opposite.

01:30:18.875 --> 01:30:23.416
You made up an alibi
about Sarah's disappearance

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.041
and pretended to be looking for her.

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:26.958
What for?

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:29.041
To avoid the accusation.

01:30:32.875 --> 01:30:34.041
What accusation?

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.166
That you murdered Sarah.

01:30:46.666 --> 01:30:48.458
You're kidding.

01:30:50.291 --> 01:30:51.625
They're all insane.

01:30:52.541 --> 01:30:54.166
You're insane too.

01:30:58.333 --> 01:30:59.750
They lied.

01:31:00.958 --> 01:31:02.250
They all lied.

01:31:04.541 --> 01:31:06.666
She was alive when she was with me.

01:31:08.666 --> 01:31:10.000
Did they tell you

01:31:11.583 --> 01:31:13.416
about Setsuko?

01:31:14.958 --> 01:31:16.041
Did they?

01:31:19.375 --> 01:31:20.375
Setsuko?

01:31:28.291 --> 01:31:30.333
Setsuko killed her.

01:31:30.416 --> 01:31:31.625
She killed her.

01:31:33.041 --> 01:31:33.916
That's right.

01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:37.708
It must be Setsuko.

01:31:38.250 --> 01:31:39.458
I'm sure of it.

01:31:41.375 --> 01:31:42.833
She killed her.

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.875
There's no one else.

01:31:50.291 --> 01:31:51.708
Setsuko killed her.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.875
It's Setsuko.

01:31:57.625 --> 01:31:58.833
You don't believe me?

01:32:02.541 --> 01:32:03.916
You don't believe me?

01:32:21.083 --> 01:32:25.375
TOGETHER FOR MENTAL HEALTH

01:33:10.166 --> 01:33:11.375
Don't be sad.

01:33:18.625 --> 01:33:19.958
You're alive?

01:33:27.625 --> 01:33:28.958
You know?

01:33:30.333 --> 01:33:32.625
They said I'm crazy.

01:33:32.708 --> 01:33:36.166
They don't believe
that you're still alive.

01:33:36.875 --> 01:33:40.583
They don't believe it.

01:33:40.666 --> 01:33:44.916
They think I'm the one who killed you.

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:49.958
There's no way I could kill you.

01:33:51.708 --> 01:33:54.083
They're the ones who did bad things to me.

01:33:55.458 --> 01:33:57.875
They're evil.

01:33:58.708 --> 01:34:00.625
They're evil.

01:34:03.625 --> 01:34:05.125
But we're not.

01:34:08.583 --> 01:34:09.708
Mom.

01:34:12.458 --> 01:34:13.833
Mom.

01:35:24.333 --> 01:35:27.375
Ayano…

01:35:37.083 --> 01:35:38.458
Goodbye, Sarah.

01:35:43.291 --> 01:35:45.500
Finally, you can be with your mom.

01:35:51.833 --> 01:35:53.333
I hope you rest in peace.
